Quote:  I [the Otago Goldfields Commissioner] cannot describe how welcome that `clay' [pipe] was to me, ... with Dub. [Dublin, an Irish miner], Mexican and Pat, for my companions; the others having gathered round the rough table to enjoy the Irish game of `Forty-fives'.

Quote:  A background of the haze engendered by tobacco and coal [in Buller pubs] is cards. As staple as beer is, more so is the game of `forty-fives', impossible of definition, where the five of the trump suit beats all other cards and the table gets a thumping. It accumulates all the good-natured interest and noise of which pubs are capable.

Quote:  In smoky little back parlours [in Westport] friendly little groups meet to play `forty-fives' with uproarious oaths and much heavy thumping of the table. For [100] the uninitiated it may be stated that in this  game the five-fingers (the five of the trump suit) beats all other cards. The trump suit order is five, jack, ace, king queen - all other suits begin with the king. Non-trump suits win high in red; low in black. Obviously the ace of diamonds is the lowest card in the pack unless diamonds are trumps, in which case it is the fourth best. The word `obviously' in the preceding sentence is a little optimistic - as the ace of hearts (the Maggy) is always the third best trump. It is credibly  reported (a) that the game is of Irish origin (b) that there  are no written rules (c) that the game can only be learned by  playing it, and (d) it is as characteristic of Westport as whitebait or coal.

Quote:  The game played was called Forty-fives, and he could make neither head nor tail of the method of play. There was no money on the table, but a record of games played and won was made on a cribbage board by shifting a match about in the holes. At the conclusion of each game and [sic] a score of forty-five was reached, the losers shouted drinks for the other players, and the cards were shuffled round again. ... The fourth man stood up and excitedly thumped the table with the five of hearts. `I've been waiting for that, twenty-five - one - five, now lead and keep leading.'  Play and conversation went on in a similar strain. Dave endeavoured explain the rudiments of the game. `The sequence of the game is highest in red cards and lowest in black. The highest card in the pack is the five of whatever suit turns up, then comes the Jack, and the ace of hearts is always the third highest trump in the pack. But you'll never learn the game looking on, it's too hard to follow. They play four legs to a game
which is called a `horse.' Jim's playing a hundred pounds a game, twenty pounds a leg, and twenty pounds at the completion of the game. Then they start again.'
