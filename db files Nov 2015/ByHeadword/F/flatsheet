Quote:  Flatsheet: A steel plate, usually four feet square and up to three-eighths of an inch thick, used on underground rail junctions instead of points and on the floor of the brace and shaft chambers to enable the handling and turning of ore-trucks. A considerable amount of skill and strength was required to handle the loaded trucks, which weighed 25 cwt, on these flatsheets. The trucks were built with two-thirds of the weight on the front axle to enable a man to lift the rear-end while turning the truck.
