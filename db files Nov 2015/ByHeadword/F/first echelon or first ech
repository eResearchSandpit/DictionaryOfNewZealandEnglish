Quote:  But the most common name for the first group of New Zealand soldiers to see active service in the Middle East during the Second World War is the First Echelon ...  Soon after New Zealand declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, a call went out for volunteers for a special force comprising a wide range of army units.  The use of the military term `Echelon' in the sense of first, second or third echelon has puzzled many people. It refers to the position of an army in the form of steps or parallel lines, each line being a little to the left or right of the preceding one. However, the name was given because the main groups of New Zealanders sent overseas in previous wars had been called contingents.
