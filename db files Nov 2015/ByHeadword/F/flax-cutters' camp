Quote:  flax: New Zealand flax, phormium tenax, a plant that grows in clumps of tall sword-like leaves with strong fibres. Strips of the leaves are woven to make the matting used in village churches and meeting-houses. The fibre had commercial use, and until the depression flax mills and flax-cutters' camps, temporary rough quarters for harvesters, would be found near swamps where the flax grew.
