Quote:  FLATHEAD <i>Kathetostoma giganteum</i> Haast ... Other names for the Flathead are Chinaman and Frenchman, but where these names originated and for what reason I do not know with certainty. One theory is that when Chinamen hawked fish about Dunedin they kept Flatheads for their own consumption, as they preferred them to all other fish.

Quote:  Family  URANISCOPIDAE. The flathead, <i>Kathetostoma giganteum</i> ..., is usually found on its own, often burrowing in the sea bed with just the eyes and mouth showing. It shares this way of lifeq (and its wide heavy heady, flattened on top, eyes staring upwards) with the stargazers and catfish. Some fishermen call it chinaman.
