Quote:  The admirable second edition of the New Zealand Pocket Oxford Dictionary (NZPOD)(1997) is inconsistent in its selection of legal terms and occasionally does not record different local meanings of English legal words it includes. Some obsolete terms (e.g. entail, foreclosure, probation)are not noted as historical only.
