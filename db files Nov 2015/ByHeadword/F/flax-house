Quote:  and a flax-house at [186] Uwoua, eighty feet long by twenty-four broad and forty feet high to the

ridge-pole, was built by a chief and a large company of natives for a small keg of powder 25lbs. in weight. The house was extremely water-tight and warm, and several streams and marshes had been denuded of their rushes (raupo) to cover the roof and sides; ... <i>Ibid. 1/210-211 The largest public works undertaken are those of flax-houses, some of which are above one hundred [211] feet in length, thirty feet in width, and forty feet in height. These are built less for ornament than being durable and water-tight, as any rain pouring on the flax would discolour and finally rot it.
