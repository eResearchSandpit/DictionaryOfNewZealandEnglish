Quote:  Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A

sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a  two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

Quote:  The evidence for the defence is that a four-tooth ewe ceases to be a four-tooth as soon as the fifth tooth, or the fifth and sixth tooth, appear through the gums... The witnesses for the plaintiff... are unanimous in their opinion that a ewe two and a-half years old is still a four-tooth ewe, although the fifth and sixth teeth have appeared... I have accordingly to settle the matter as follows - a ewe is correctly defined as a four-tooth until the fifth and sixth tooth reach maturity.
