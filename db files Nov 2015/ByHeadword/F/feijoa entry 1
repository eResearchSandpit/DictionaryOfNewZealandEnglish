Quote:  Did you know that Feijoa is almost more uniquely

"Kiwi" than Kiwifruit?  It's true! And Hubbard's is, of course, uniquely New Zealand! So marry the two up and you have got "Forever Feijoa".

Quote:  The Feijoa, Feijoa sellowiana, is virtually unknown worldwide as a fruit crop. It originates from South America, from the high altitudes of Western Paraguay, Southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Although it has been cultivated in New Zealand for over 50 years, it is a relatively new export crop.

Quote:  As the flesh of feijoas discolours rapidly when it is exposed to the air, peeled fruit can be kept light golden by being put into water to which a little salt, vinegar or lemon juice has been added.

Quote:  A native of South America, the feijoa is grown in many parts of the world only as an ornamental plant. Favourable conditions in New Zealand, however, produce sizeable fruit of considerable commercial and culinary potential. <i>Ibid.</i> 147. Here is a New Zealand adaptation [or trifle] using feijoas, which are unknown in English cooking.

Quote:  Ray Hollis knows of sdeveral different ways to enjoy the syrupy, tangy taste of feijoas - in desserts, relishes, or even made into wine - but his favourite is to bake them in a pie... Natives of Brazil and Uruguay, feijoas were first introduced to New Zealand as seed in 1908... Now New Zealand is at the forefront of research on feijoas and is probably the only country that exports the fruit.

Quote:  When I was a kid on the other side of the world, the food I missed most was hokey pokey icecream. Now, on the verge of leaving again, I know it'll be feijoas... Feijoas taste pretty good raw... Their rich flavour goes a long way, which is good if you're short on either feijoas or cash - you can bulk out a feijoa crumble and even that chutney with apples at a third of the price.

Quote:  If your feijoa is not fully ripe and no one has told you that it's best scooped with a spoon rather than bitten into, you will wind up with a mouthful of gritty, sour pulp.
