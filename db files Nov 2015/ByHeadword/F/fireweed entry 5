Quote:  WILLOW WEED (<i>Epilobium</i> sp[p].). - This is also called herb willow, swamp willow, and by confusion redshank and fireweed. It is a native that occasionally grows as a weed in or near ditches. The name is sometimes given to redshank [59], and it is true that both polygonum and epilobium grow in damp places, have willow-like leaves and are about 2 feet high.
