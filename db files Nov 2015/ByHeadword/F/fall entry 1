Quote:  Sawmillers confind men to `fall' kauri only during these

two months.... During these two months, July and August, let them `ring' the trees, that is cut out a ring of bark and sap 3 or 4 inches wide round all the trees they intend to cut down or `fall' during the next 12 months. ... I have no doubt that these serious defects arise from the practice of `falling' the kauri all through the year.
