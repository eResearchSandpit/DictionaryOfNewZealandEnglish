Quote:  ... the way to ask for a truce in a game is to call Pax ... At the  school I went to, the word was Fritz, and the truce was terminated  by the call Fritz all over, but we knew that some schools used  Fans (from south-west English dialect fain I or fainits ?). Apparently some New Zealand schools use or have used baldy, which sounds like a variant of English barley.

Quote:  Thanks to a flood of correspondence, my ignorance is now abated. The commonest truce word in New Zealand seems to be `fans' with a variant, `fangs' ... As children grow up, the words fall into disuse. They are not forgotten. One of my daughters complained that I had not consulted. Her word had been `fans'.
