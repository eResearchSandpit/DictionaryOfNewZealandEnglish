Quote:  .. sheep up to a kilometre away would run in a startled manner and many of these would be flagged. 'Flagging' is a name coined where a sheep has had the wool pulled up on its back as if grabbed by a hand or in this case pulled up by a kea's beak. One winter some 38 sheep died and another 200 flagged.
