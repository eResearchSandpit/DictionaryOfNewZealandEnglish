Notes: ref at www.jinxmagazine.com/fishkicker.html - a Canadian/Alaskan site. "The vast majority of species was removed via the foot, I would kick the things onto a belt all day long eighteen hours a day for forty some straight days deep, deep in the northern latitudes of the dismal Bering Sea. Basically I crawled into a box of living or half living things drug up from the deep ocean and kick them out. This for forty days in the year 1994 was my cog in life. I was a Fishkicker."
