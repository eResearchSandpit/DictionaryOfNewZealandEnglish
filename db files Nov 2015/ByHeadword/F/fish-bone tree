Quote:  The <i>Aralia crassifolia</i> or fish bone tree is a curious object in the New Zealand woods. It runs up with a slender stem to thirty feet, having tufts of leaves thrown out near the top, which are about a foot in length and an inch in breadth, of a thick, coriaceous texture, irregularly jagged at the edges and abrupt at the end.
