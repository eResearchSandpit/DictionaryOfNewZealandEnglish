Quote:  Charles Lush, of Parnell, Auckland, on January 22, 1864, wrote in his diary about his activities that day, including, "... I also bought two penny worth of fly kooks for Martin." Alison Drummond, the editor of the <i>Waikato Journals of Vicesimus Lush</i> (Pegasus Press, 1982) in which this entry is printed, identifies "fly kooks" as "cookies, know to generations of children as 'squashed fly biscuits'"
