Quote:  During the 1850s large areas of Crown Land were made available under the 40-acre system, which entitled an adult immigrant on payment of his own fare from Britain, to a grant of 40 acres, plus 40 for his wife, and 20 for each member of his family aged between five and 18 years. Under the 40-acre system the immigrant gave an undertaking to remain in the province and not sell his land for a period of five years, after which time he would be given the freehold title of the land.
