Quote:  Probably the most common trouble is the so-called `store-' or `freezer-burn' which does not become apparent until the goods have been frozen for a considerable time. These comprise unsightly light-red patches ... `Burn' is widely held to be caused by the low temperatures to which these delicate tissues are subjected in the process of freezing and storage.
