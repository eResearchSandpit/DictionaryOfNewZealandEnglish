Quote:  Fill or filling: The material, usually soft rock or clay from near the surface, which was tipped down passes into the various filled stopes, to fill the space from which the ore had been removed and which otherwise might collapse if left unsupported. Some sand filling (tailings from the battery) was used successfully in the Grand Junction Mine.
