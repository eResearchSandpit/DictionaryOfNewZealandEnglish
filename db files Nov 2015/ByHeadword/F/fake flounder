Quote:  Name give by early South Island fishermen to the Megrim, or Witch, flatfish. This `fake' flounder was frequently caught and kept to hand out to cadgers who frequented the docks in

search of a few fish from the commercial fishermen just returned from sea. ... Also called Fake Flounder. <i>Ibid.</i> 74  MEGRIM Witch-fish and Fake Flounder are just two names for this skinny, poor-eating, barely flatfish.
