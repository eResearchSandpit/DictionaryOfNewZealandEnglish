Quote:  From 1844 to 1847 the `red tribe' fought the first New Zealandwar, against Hone Heke, and his allies. The `Flagstaff War', as it is sometimes called, followed a build up of disappointment, frustration, and suspicion, amongst the northern tribes, in the years immediately following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. <i>Ibid.</i> 13 The "Flagstaff War" began on 8 July 1844 when Heke and his warriors ascended the hill above Kororareka and chopped down the flagstaff from which  the Union Jack.. was flying.
