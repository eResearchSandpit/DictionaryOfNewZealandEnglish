Quote:  Frequently the surplus grass runs to seed and afterwards there is a great deal of what graziers call 'flag.' This flag is neglected by the sheep; they prefer the shorter green grass. In danthonia country, therefore, as in rough bush country, it is profitable to run a limited number of cattle among the sheep. They clean up this rough 'flag', break through bushy and rushy obstacles and thus purify the pasture for the sheep.
