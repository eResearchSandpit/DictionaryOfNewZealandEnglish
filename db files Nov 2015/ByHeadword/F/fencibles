Quote:  The corps known as the Royal New Zealand Fencibles, ... was a body of veteran soldiers converted into military settlers, established through Governor Grey's efforts as a protection for the southern frontier of the Auckland Settlement. It consisted of discharged British soldiers, about three-fourths of them pensioners, and all men of approved character and physique. The corps was enrolled in England in 1847. The term of service in New Zealand was to be seven years (most of the soldiers became permanent settlers); ... on arrival in the colony each Fencible was given possession of a two-roomed cottage and an acre of land ... The members of the corps

were required to attend six days' drill in the spring and six in autumn, and to attend church parade every Sunday, fully armed, for inspection. ... The settlements in which the pensioners were established were Onehunga, Otahuhu, [451] Panmure, and Howick; these places were practically founded as villages by the Fencibles.

Quote:  After Hone Heke's rebellion ... in 1845, military settlements to provide a bulwark between Auckland and the Maoris had been established, at Onehunga, Otahuhu, Howick and Panmure. These settlers were military pensioners, called `Fencibles' and their villages were to form a ring of husbandsmen trained to the use of arms; a self-supporting guard.

Quote:  The Fencibles were pensioners from various regiments of the British Army, all of whom had seen over 20 years of active service in India, China, Afghanistan, or other countries. Although no longer fit for the rigours of overseas campaigns, they were all under 48 years of age, of good physique and character, and quite fit for the garrison duty which was theirs when they came to New Zealand in the years 1847-8; a few following in 1852.
