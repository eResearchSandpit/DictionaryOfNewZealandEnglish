fantail
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:A handsome flycatcher of the New Zealand bush. Pre-settlement North Island writers prefer piwaka(waka) (Markham 1834, Yate 1835);  early more-or-less scientific writers prefer fantailed (less often fantail) flycatcher, or merely flycatcher; fantail as a popular name is attested in 1845 (1854) (Wellington), 1851 (Taranaki) and sanctioned by Buller (1873 (1888)). Also called piwakawaka, tiwakawaka,  shortened from fantail(ed) flycatcher, <i>Rhipidura flabellifera</i>, Pied or North Island Fantail,  =piwakawaka; and <i>R. fuliginosa</i>, Black or South Island Fantail, =tiwaiwaka.
