Quote:  Not many New Zealand Schoolgirls prior to the 1960's would be unfamiliar with the art of French knitting.  I can recall the homemade version of the 'machine', easily assembled with a cotton reel and four nails. ... all I ever came up with was miles of French knitting twisted into circular table mats which, not surprisingly, were not in great demand.
