Quote:  Future: (-1938 a `corporation', a `pukunui). The last time I heard this used was by someone who had lived in the Rangi-tikei, Auckland, and Wellington. It was quite familiar to me, but I could not recollect definitely any occasion on which I had heard it. Might have been in Auckland, or possibly from friends in the Rangitikei district.
