Quote:  <i>A Frigate Bird Sings</i> follows the struggle of a fa'afafine.. trying to understand and redefine her contribution to her Samoan family, now living in New Zealand. "It's an extremely delicate subject.. particularly among older Polynesians, because in New Zealand the fa'afafine are part of the gay scene; they've become much more visible and upfront about something that in Samoa is an accepted part of their culture. I think some Polynesians feel that the fa'afafine have become an embarrassment to who we are."

Quote:  Boys will be girls in Samoa. That's the theme of <i>Paradise Bent</i>, a documentary about fa'afafine showing this weekend at the Outtakes Film Festival... "Most of the families consider having a fa'afafine in the house an asset, because in the plantations they are men and in the home they are very useful. They do the sewing, the ironing and the cooking and they look after people," says one of the women. Then there is the next generation of fa'afafine who are seen more as drag queens.

Quote:  Daryla is what is known as a fa'afafine or feminine man... The tradition of fa'afafines, which literally means "like a woman", is unique to Samoan and Tonga culture. A fa'afafine dresses in women's clothes, has a woman's name and talks and walks like a woman. They prefer straight men... My understanding of the fa'afafine tradition was that in Samoan culture, if a family had no daughters, then the youngest boys is treated as a girl and kept at home to help the mother. These boys then grow up to be fa'afafines.

Quote:  Pinot noir, pinot blanc, and pinot gris.. all hang under the same name because their bunches cluster in neatly packed shapes similar to pine cones, 'pinot' to Latins. The relationship doesn't end there; under the skin all are part of one of the grape world's most genetically unstable families; the fafafini of the grape world.
