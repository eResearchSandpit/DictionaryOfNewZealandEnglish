Quote:  Making a sustained effort in maintaining progress in work routine, or social commitments. .in 4;`I've been extra busy, this last day or two, I had to shift some young stock into another paddock; I found a couple of loose wires, and had to fix that. I had to go to town to pick up a part they were welding for me. I've been flat out like a lizard drinking.'
