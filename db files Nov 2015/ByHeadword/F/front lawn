Quote:  "We've fetished the front lawn," says Dann. "Where else could you call a group the Front Lawn and everyone knew what the joke was?" The front Lawn is now unfortunately concreted over, as it were, but in the garden the concept remains "quintessentially Kiwi; it speaks volumes about our culture"... In New Zealand the front lawn has always been an upwardly mowable status symbol.. but mostly.. front lawns are there to keep people away.
