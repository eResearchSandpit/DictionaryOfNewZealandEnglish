Quote:  Because of this [the height of the plane] the flag-men are important. At Kapiti Station six 'flag-men' were used, working in pairs. Two pairs gave the aircraft the marks to run in and out, and the this pair then had time to move into a new position. From eight to ten men were engaged on the job during the progress of the spraying, including some of the station shepherds who acted as flagmen to direct the pilot on each run.
