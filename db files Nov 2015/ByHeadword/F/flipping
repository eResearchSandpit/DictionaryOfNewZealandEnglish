Quote:  The most innovative soil improvement technique to be used in the conversions will be pasture flipping - a practice pioneered at Cape Foulwind to bring free-draining soils to the surface and turn sour wetland into lush pasture .. A group of Cape Foulwind dairy farmers, together with Agriculture New Zealand consultant Richard Reynolds, and Landcare Research Scientist Dr Craig Ross, are evaluating flipping or breaking up the pakihi iron pan to bring free-draining soil to the top. The technique was developed by a local farmer, the late Fred King, and his son Alex, and costs between $2500 and $5000 a hectare.
