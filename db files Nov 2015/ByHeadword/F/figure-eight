Quote:  Twenty-one days on bread and water in the Dummy. Seven days in `figure eights'. ... The `figure-eight' is a mild version of the French Foreign Legion's beloved  torture, le crapaud. For a period of hours each day, ranging from two to four, the prisoner's arms are doubly handcuffed across the small of his back, wrists and elbows forced together. No leglocks are used. He can sit, stand, or lie as he pleases.
