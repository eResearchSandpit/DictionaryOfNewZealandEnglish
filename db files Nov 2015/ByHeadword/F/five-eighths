Quote:   [It is stated that in 1889 Alhambra came from Dunedin to play Merivale and played only one half-back instead of two. The man who would have been the second half-back `stood between [the half-back] and the three-quarters line.' The Club had no name for the new position, and some discussion took place about it. The argument was ended when a Merivale player said that if the new position was between half and three-quarters, he must be five-eighths. The name was adopted.]

Quote:  The pivot for most of Alhambra's attacks [sc. in a game in Dunedin between Kaikorai and Alhambra in 1890] was the extra player between the halfback and the three-quarter line.  After the game players from both sides sat around discussing tactics and a Merivale back, one F. Childs, is credited with coming up with the new name, five-eighths. A blacksmith, Childs obviously thought logically. If the player was not a half and was not a threequarter, he said, he was between the two and therefore must be a five-eighth.
