Quote:  fn [a fat sheep, fat-stock] 1. I remember shortly after arrival in New Zealand watching the well-known dealer, Andrew Grant, picking `fats.' When asked by me for his hesitancy and discrimination in regard to several apparently prime blacks, his answer was that they `killed' badly. So many statements, nevertheless, continue to be accepted because it is nobody's interest to disprove them, that this dealer's belief is given for what it was worth. On the other hand, what Sandy Grant did not know of sheep was not worth knowing.
