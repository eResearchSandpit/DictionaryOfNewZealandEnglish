Quote:  In the lower regions the forest was much enlivened by birds. I shot some parrots [fn Nestor meridionalis. Kaka of the natives.], pigeons [fn Columba spadicea, Lath. Kukupa.], and wattle-birds [fn Glaucopis cinerea, Gmel. Kokako.]. Among the branches of the trees hopped the Neat fantail flycatcher [fn Muscicapa flabellifera, Gml. Piwakawaka.], and a social bird of a yellow colour, which has been depicted by Forster [fn Orthornyx heteroclytus, Lef. Popokatea.], and which had much the habits of the finch. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/77 Sometimes, indeed, the mako-mako [fn Philedon Dumerilii] pours forth ... its melodious notes; or perhaps a hawk [fn Falco brunnea] is seen watching the movements of a smaller bird; or the fan-tail flycatcher busy in the lower branches.
