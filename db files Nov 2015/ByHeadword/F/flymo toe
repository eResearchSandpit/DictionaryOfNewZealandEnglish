Quote:  National Party presidency hopeful Geoff Thompson has suffered the indignity of a "Flymo toe"...  [He] slipped while mowing a bank.., chopped off a big toe and damaged another toe next to it... Mr Thompson said the injury is quite common, hence the name, Flymo toe, given it by hospital staff.
