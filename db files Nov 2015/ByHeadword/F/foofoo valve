Notes: OED says foofoo (1826) is a kind of West African dough made from plantains. Partridge says a foofoo valve is 'a mythical "gadget" that's always blamed for any mechanical breakdown' but is RN slang dating back to around 1910. The phrase was common in the 1940s in NZ but was usually used in the figurative in the context of telling someone to take things steady - "Go easy or you'll bust your foofoo valve".
