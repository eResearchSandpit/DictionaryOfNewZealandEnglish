Quote:  Even Shirty Williams the 'Fifty-oner forgot his ulcers and managed a smile.  <i>Ibid.</i> 70 `It wasn't a strike [in 1951 in the waterfront] then?' I asked. `No. She was a lock-out, Henry. We had a disagreement with the bosses and told 'em only work a forty-hour week till she was settled. The bosses said: `Right ho, go on penalty the whole perishing lot or you - and stay on penalty.' `Then the 'Fifty-oners moved in and took our jobs. Rotten cow.'
