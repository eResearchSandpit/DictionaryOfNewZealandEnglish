Quote:  Forest is, of course, still in use, but it does not come as  naturally to the tongue as bush, and there are no words derived from it in this part of the world. It is stiffer, more formal, more technical. We may speak of kauri forest or beech forest, but we get lost in the bush, fight bush fires, and climb above the bushline. The kauri forest, like the mixed podocarp forest, the sub-tropical rain forest, ... and such-like are terms that come from the botanist and forester, not from the layman - or from the bushman.
