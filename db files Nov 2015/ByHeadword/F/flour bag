Quote:  Most women in those days bought flour in 28-pound bags... The flour bags were made of good unbleached calico and the salt bags a lovely fine soft cotton. Most bakers had a pile of washed hundred-weight flour bags for ninepence and a shilling. I made every article of underclothing and sleeping garments for all of us out of flour bags.
Notes:  [HWO : flour was sold in 25, 50 and 100 pound calico bags]
