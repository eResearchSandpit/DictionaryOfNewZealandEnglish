Quote:  ... and on to the great green shoulders of Makara Hill. There they sat down on the blowing grass and pink `fairy trumpets' or on the white and yellow daisies and dandelions, and while his father had a chew of tobacco, Old Tar (who was very young Tar indeed then) sat quiet ... `Wot do you mean?' asked the little boy one day, sitting, his legs straight out, making finger gloves of the fairy trumpets.
