Quote:  Force.. It is different from eye, the dog's control of sheep by staring them in the face, and from noise, in that there are plenty of dogs which yap, yap continually and yet seem to make little or no impression on their sheep. Huntaways are sometimes spoken of as forcing dogs; but the term force is also applied to the ability of a heading dog to pull sheep. (C.)
