Quote:  A rugged brightly painted Fun Ho! toy in Santa's stocking on Christmas morning was a surprise bringing approving smiles to the faces of Kiwi kids for generations.... Harold (Jack) Underwood made lead slush tops and semiflat figures in his basement as a hobby, unaware that those experiments would become the success that enabled him to resign from the public service and enter the toy-making business... There is an absolutely positively Wellington origin about the distinctive Fun Ho! trademark, too. The design with exclamation nmark was by the late E Mervyn Taylor, a New Zealand arrist who worked in the city at the same time as an illustrator and commercial artist... The earliest Fun Ho! models were made from lead and appear to have been produced in Wellington.
