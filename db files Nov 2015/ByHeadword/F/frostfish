Quote:  ~ name given in Australia and New Zealand to the European <i>Scabbard-fish, Lepidopus caudatus</i>, White. The name is said to be derived from the circumstance that the fish is found alive on New Zealand sea-beaches on frosty nights. It is called the <i>Scabbard-fish</i> in Europe, because it is like the shining  white metal sheath of a long sword. <i>Lepidopus</i> belongs to the family <i>Trichiurida</i>; it reaches a length of five or six feet, but is so thin that it hardly weighs as many pounds. It is considered a delicacy in New Zealand.

Quote:  FROSTFISH <i>Lepidopus caudatus</i> ... Frostfish have a scaleless body and are a uniform bright silver colour. They spend the cold winter months in deep offshore water beyond the edge of the continental shelf and apparently come to the surface on clear still nights when the moon is full; although it maybe that they are on the surface at other times but are not seen because of the dull rough conditions. ... They are occasionally found stranded on beaches.
