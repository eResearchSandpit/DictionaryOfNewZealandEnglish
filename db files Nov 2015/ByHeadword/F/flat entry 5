Quote:  `Te Rapa' was not of an investment purpose, gorse in golden bloom spread its noxious mantle across some beautiful river flats, many fences were railed for the Poverty Bay Hunt Club, who often held Drag runs, and this sporting process of `Hounds' with the etceteras that follow the

vagaries of Hunt Clubs, soon decided against purchasing.
