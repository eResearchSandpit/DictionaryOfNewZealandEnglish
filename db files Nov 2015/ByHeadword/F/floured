Quote:  The mercury plates were seldom perfect: the finest gold was lost by flotation while with cemented gold a thin coating of iron oxide (`rusty gold') often prevented amalgamation. The mercury itself became `sick' or `floured'; both sodium and nitric acid were employed to improve its amalgamating qualities.
