Quote:   ... the way to ask for a truce in a game is to call Pax ... At the school I went to, the word was Fritz, and the truce was terminated by the call Fritz all over, but we knew that some schools used  Fans (from south-west English dialect fain I or fainits?).  Apparently some New Zealand schools use or have used baldy, which sounds like a variant of English barley.
