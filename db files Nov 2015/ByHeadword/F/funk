Quote:  [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899: reference, game of Little Ring] Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.

Quote:   `Reverend Mother talks of when she used to give you marbles for being a good little boy - pee-wees and agates, and stonies and glassies and a big tor. And once she tried to play with you, and you said she funked because her knuckle was inside the ring.'
