Quote:  This fungus was used as food [by Maoris] in times of scarcity. It was washed and cooked before it burst when the white mushroom-like sphere becomes an expanded net-work, the meshes covered with an offensive brown slime. ... Its sudden appearance, often after thunder, caused it to be given two very expressive names - tutae-kehua and tutae-whatitiri (ghost-dirt and thunder-dirt [=shit])
