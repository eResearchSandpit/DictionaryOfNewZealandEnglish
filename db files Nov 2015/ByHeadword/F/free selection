Quote:  It is rumored - but we can't vouch for the accuracy of it - that as soon as road lines are cut through the bush country the land will be thrown open for free selection as was done in Canterbury. We are, however, disposed to receive the statement with caution, because the principle of free selection in bush country would be much more difficult to carry out than it would be in open land.
