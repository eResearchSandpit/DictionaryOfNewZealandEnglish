Quote:  FLANNEL LEAF (<i>Verbascum thapsus</i>) is commonly called mullein in England, and is frequently so called here as well. Its commonest local name is probably tobacco plant, or native tobacco, a name for which there is no justification in either appearance or use. Velvet mullein, woolly mullein, golden rod, and Aaron's rod are other appellations, but flannel leaf, one of the common sheep-station names is both descriptive and distinctive. The plant is found in dry soil and river beds ... in both islands.
