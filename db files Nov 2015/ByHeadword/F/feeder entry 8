Quote:  When the flax arrives at the mill it is weighed and credited to the cutter. The `bench loader'

then takes two or three bundles and puts them in a barrel (heavy end down). He then takes the longest leaves and places them on a bench convenient to the `feeder'. ...[44] The `feeder' takes each blade separately and places the butt end into the `stripper' which takes the green outer covering off. ... The fibre as it leaves the stripper is caught by the `fly boy', who collects enough to make into a hank, which he places convenient for the `shaker'. The latter, with a motion like cracking a whip, gets rid of as much rubbish as possible, after which he places the hank handy for the `washer'. This man places the fibre in a vat, through which ... clean water is running.
