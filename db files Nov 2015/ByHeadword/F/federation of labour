Quote:  In 1908 there was a local strike [on the West Coast] and shortly afterwards the miners formed a Federation of Labour to which, within a few years, were affiliated most of the miners and waterside workers. The 1912 constitution of the `Red Federation' began with the preamble of the IWW ... <i>Ibid.</i> 280 The more militant unionists were unhappy about their regimentation in the Federation of Labour, which was formed in 1937, or the restriction of their action by compulsory arbitration and the Government's `stabilization' policy.
