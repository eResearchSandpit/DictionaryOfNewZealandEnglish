Quote:  An informer to the police: Australian: since ca. 1910. In, e.g., Partridge 1937, and Sidney J. Baker, A Dictionary of Australian Slang, 1942 (and, a year earlier, in his new Zealand Slang). Often shortened to fiz(z): Baker, 1945. By contemptuous euphemism; not unrelated to thingamyjig. Baker (1945), however, points out that it may derive from fizgig, Australian for `fishing spear': cf. therefore, spear, v., 1.
