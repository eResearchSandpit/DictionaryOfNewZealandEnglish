Quote:  The less important [is] ... near the celebrated Milford Sound, in Fiordland. This locality is remarkable owing to the presence with the platinum of that peculiar nickel-iron mineral awaruite. In appearance it is not unlike platinum, and was mistaken by the miners for that mineral. ... Both the metal and the awaruite occur in a district composed ... of serpentine and dunite.
