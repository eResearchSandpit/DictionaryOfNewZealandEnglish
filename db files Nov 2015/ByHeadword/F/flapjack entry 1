Quote:  A little lower down where the seaweeds are permanently submerged we have such plants as the GRAPELET, the WIRE- WEED, and OX-TONGUE; the FLAP-JACK and GIRDLE WEEDS. In rather deeper water ... we have the (<i>Lessonia</i>) and the OARWEED, the GRAPEWEED, and numerous representatives of the red algae. <i>Ibid./</i> Flora 14  The commonest of the four species is (<i>C[arpophyllum]  maschalocarpum</i>) which has been designated by the apt and appropriate name of FLAP-JACK from the habit of the plant in swaying first in one direction and then the other as the water enters or recedes from the surge channels between tidal rocks.
