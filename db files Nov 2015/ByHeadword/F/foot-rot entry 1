Quote:  If any cases of foot-rot are found, the whole bought-in mob should be kept in isolation for a period sufficiently long to ensure that all have sound, uninfected feet. Not until the hill-country breeding farms eradicate foot-rot will its complete control on fat-lamb farms become a practical possibility.
