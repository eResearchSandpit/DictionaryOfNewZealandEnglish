The word <i>Gurnet</i> is an obsolete or provincial form of <i>Gurnard</i>, revived in Australia, and  applied to the fish <i>Centropogon scorpaenoides</i>, Guich., family Scorpaenidae. The original word <i>Gurnard</i> is retained in New Zealand, and applied to the new species <i>Trigla kumu</i> (kumu being the Maori name), family Cottidae. The <i>Flying Gurnet</i> is

<i>Trigla polyommata</i>, Richards., found on all the Australian coasts  from New South Wales to Western Australia, family <i>Cottidae</i>. It is a distinct species, not included in the British species. They have large pectoral fins, but are not known to possess the power of supporting themselves in the air like the `flying fish' which belong  to other genera. Sir Fredk. McCoy says that <i>Sebastes Percoides</i>,  Richards., is called Gurnet, or Garnet-perch, by the fishermen and dealers, as well as the more common <i>Neosebastes scorpaenoides</i>,  Guich., and <i>Scorpaena panda</i>, Richards.] <i>Ibid.</i> 384

<i>Red Gurnet-Perch, n.</i> name given in Victoria to the fish <i>Sebastes percoides</i>,  Richards., family <i>Scorpeaenidae</i>. It is also called <i>Poddy; Red Gurnard</i>, or <i>Gurnet</i>; and in New Zealand, <i>Pohuikaroa</i>.  See <i>Perch</i> and <i>Gurnet</i>.]
