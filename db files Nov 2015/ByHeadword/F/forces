Quote:  Action terms which refer to the shooting of the marbles are: Knuckle down Stiff, Knee High, Funks [Flunks sic] or Funnicks, Slips, Firsts and Lasts and Forces. ... The term `Knuckle down

Stiff' (Taranaki [18]80, Gisborne [18]85, Waitara [18]95) is mentioned by [Lady A.B. Gomme Vo. 1, p.113]. ... As Taranaki [18]80 says, `The term was called out in order to prevent too easy a success against a marble near the ring'. It was less advantageous to fire with the hand on the ground than with the hand elevated, perhaps at `Knee High'.
