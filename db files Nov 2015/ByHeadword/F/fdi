Quote:  The absurdity of the GDP-based taregt, was nicely illustrated by the Boston Consulting Group's report "Building the Future: Using Foreign Direct Investment to Help Fuel New Zealand's Economic Prosperity", released with the Prime Minister's speech that opened Parliament. The report is less economic analysis than a public relations effort to get us to adopt a strategy of increasing FDI.
