Quote:  Fam. Plectognathi. - The <i>Pakirikiri</i>, (balistes,) file fish, is distinguished by two strong spines at the commencement of the dorsal fin, in shape like the letter V, both fronting the head, and standing out from the fin, these are elevated at pleasure, some fish have only one. The Pakirikiri is abundant in the Bay of Islands.

Quote:  File Fish Name given in New Zealand to the <i>Monacanthus rudis</i>,  Richards, family <i>Sclerodermi</i>; in New South Wales to species of the genus <i>Balistes</i>. The first of the spines of the dorsal fin is roughened in front like a file. <i>Balistes maculatus</i> is the `Spotted File-fish' of Sydney. It is closely allied to the genus <i>Monacanthus</i>, called <i>Leather-jacket</i> (q.v.), which is much more numerously represented in Australasia.

Quote:  ROUGH LEATHER JACKET, TRIGGER-FISH or FILE-FISH (KOKIRI) <i>Parika scaber</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... This interesting fish has a number of other vernacular names, such as File-fish, and all with a bearing on its construction. The name Leather-Jacket is due to the fancied resemblance to a North American lumber jacket, not unlike the dark brown coloured jumpers used by hikers. The word rough is attached to the name Leather Jacket by fishermen, because the scales are furnished with sharp points which make the skin so rough that one's fingers cannot be rubbed freely in a direction from tail to head without losing part of one's skin, hence the name File-fish.

Quote:  ROUGH LEATHERJACKET ... <i>Other names: Novodon convexirostris</i>; triggerfish and filefish are used, but should rightly be given to a family of tropical fishes of similar appearance to our leatherjackets; kokiri (Maori).
