Quote:  A bushman always wore a special type of boot known as `ferntights', named because the upper part of the boot was sewn inside the lower leather, preventing sharp stakes from penetrating the seam and tearing the stitching. Round-headed hobnails were replaced with with square-headed `bushman's sprigs'. ... It was essential ... to have a good firm footing and `bushman's sprigs' helped to prevent us losing our foothold on a slippery bank.
