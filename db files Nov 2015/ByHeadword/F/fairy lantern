Quote:  The unusual New Zealand fairy lantern, <i>Thismia rodwayi</i>.., is related to orchids, and is the only member of its family to occur outside the topics. For most of the year, the plant exists as a white root devoid of chlorophyll and deriving its nutrients from an association with a mycorrhizal fungus.
