Quote:  `Cow' is a common word of abuse, not so surprising when so many of the people have to struggle with the beasts. If something is godawful, they'll say it's a `fair cow,' or they'll call a bad day a `cow of a day.' <i>Ibid.</i> 39 <i>Cow </i>- may just mean cow, but may also mean an unpleasant man, woman, or situation. These things may also be called progressively, <i>a fair cow</i>, and a <i>fair adjectival cow. </i>
