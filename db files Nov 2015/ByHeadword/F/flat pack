Quote:  Flat Pack: ca1942 I have only heard this term used by one or two trampers from Otago. Wellington trampers, so far as I have observed, used the term `frameless' pack' if they don't say `kidney rotter'.

Quote:   The two main varieties of packs are the <i>frame pack</i> and the <i>frameless pack,</i> sometimes called a <i>flat pack</i>. The frameless pack of course receives that name only on formal occasions, being more familiarly known by that elegant term,<i> kidney-rotter</i>, or less frequently as <i>kidney-buster, kidney-crusher, kidney-sweater or kidney-rider. </i>
