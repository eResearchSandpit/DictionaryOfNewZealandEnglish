Quote:  The animal [sc. finback whale] has been named by Cuvier the <i> Rorqualus Australis,</i>  or in English, the Rorqual of the Southern Seas. It is very little known to zoologists; and it is only within a few years that its existence has been ascertained by the scientific. The Rorqual of the Northern Seas, it will be recollected, is the largest creature in existence, attaining sometimes to a length of 120 feet, with a circumference of 40.
