Quote:  Mr Marshall says David should take the credit for the latest expansion, Kelso Ltd, in which the Kelson name has been franchised to three farms in Southland, Canterbury and Gisborne. In all, 11,000 Kelso ewes are spread across six farms - the three farm franchises, farm at Taihape and Colyton that run Kelso-owned ewes and hoggets, and a farm near Marton... For now, Kelso Ltd is concentrating on helping the franchise farms consolidate their flocks.
