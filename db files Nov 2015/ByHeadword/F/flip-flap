Quote:  The spotted shag, or flip-flap, well known to our shore folk, is stated by ornithologists to be peculiar to New Zealand; its active movements enliven many a bluff headland or rocky inlet of our island coast line... In calm autumn days often have we watched the still waters of our shallow bays flash with the swift motion of the flip-flap.
