Quote:  I had a mental debate last night as to whether to shift all my Camp up as far as the foot of the Saddle, if there is one - or leave most of it here and take a flying camp and see what was ahead ... it just becomes a matter of site [sic] up all night keeping the fire warm, when a fellow has only a Flying Camp, a Fly and a single blanket.
