Quote:  A recent invention can, however, save a lot of bleary eyes and night shifts - the foaling alarm. It's a battery-powered transmitter that's fixed to a collar round the mare's neck so that when she lies down to foal, it triggers an alarm beside Nick's bed. The alarm not only eliminates night staff, but puts a lot less stress on the mare.
