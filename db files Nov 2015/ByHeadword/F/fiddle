Quote:  Boiling down works had also been started at Green Island. Merinos were boiled down for their fat and pelts : and as the hind legs of merinos contained no fat they were given away. Jock Graham did a roaring trade in Dunedin by purchasing carrots in the Taieri and tying three of them to a hind leg of a sheep. This was known as a fiddle and he would hawk them through the streets and dispose of them for sixpence.
