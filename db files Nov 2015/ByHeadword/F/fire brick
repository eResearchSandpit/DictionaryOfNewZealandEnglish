Quote:  FIRE BRICK (<i>Asterodiscus truncatus</i>). A large and brilliant coloured species taken occasionally by trawlers, operating in the vicinity of the Hen and Chicken Islands and in the Bay of Plenty. It is more plentiful, however, in deep water off the coast of New South Wales, where the local fishermen call it the fire-brick on account of its flaming colours.
