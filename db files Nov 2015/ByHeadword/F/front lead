Quote:  Immediately north of the [Waikaka] township a rich layer in the fault-involved older quartz drifts, ... was worked from the surface ... This layer is locally known as the `back lead'. On or near it a shaft was sunk ... but was not utilised for driving-out. ... Somewhere about 1880 ... others drove an inclined drift from point to the southward of the back lead for a distance of 254 feet ... Then they drove horizontally for a short distance and intersected an auriferous ... layer of quartz wash, about 10 feet wide, known as the `front lead'. [fn quotes OED on drift as an excavated passage]
