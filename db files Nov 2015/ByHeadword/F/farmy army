Quote:  Farmy Army to wind down [heading]

Federated Farmers will wind down its 'Farmy Army' of volunteers from today.

The decision by the Christchurch City Council to cease its major clean-up operations, in which it had been aided by the Farmy Army, based at the A and P Showgrounds, and student volunteers, meant the rural volunteers would 'scale back targeted assistance' after today, Federated Farmers said on its website.
