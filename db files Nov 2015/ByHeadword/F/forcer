Quote:  These dogs had any amount of eye and style and yet they were powerful forcers with plenty of noise ... <i>Ibid.</i> 26 A bitch pup I sold ... went direct to freezing works to pen up and developed into a first class forcer and backer ... The finest backing dogs I have ever seen are in the saleyards at Addington
