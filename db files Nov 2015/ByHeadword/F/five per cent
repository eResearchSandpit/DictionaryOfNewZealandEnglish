Notes: Jim writes: Local & Historical. Several Wairarapa purchases of land from Maori in the Grey period had clauses providing that five percent of the profits of the resale of the land was to be set aside for school, flour mills, etc. for the benefit of Maori. This promise was never full honoured and was a source of Maori grievance thereafter. The <i>(Wairapapa) five percents</i> are the subject of a current application to the Waitangi Tribunal (<i>Wairarapa Times-Age</i> 6/4/00).

Quote:  The Tauwharenikau block purchase as well as Tuhitarata, was completed with the aid of a provision peculiar to the Wairarapa, the requirement that five per cent of the subsequent return from land sales should be paid back to the Maori vendors.<i>Ibid.</i> 204 More culpable was the with-holding of moneys from the five per cents... Some members of Government expected that the mill would be erected from the 'five per cents' the proceeds from sales in certain designated blocks, for which.. the construction of flour mills was an explicit objective.
