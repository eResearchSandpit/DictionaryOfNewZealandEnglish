Quote:   ... Dr Hector and myself, in drawing up a synopsis of the geological formations of New Zealand, have adopted for the formation of those subaerial accumulations the expression `Fan', for those of regular watercourses; and of `Half-cone', for those of intermittent mountain torrents, and we shall for the future use these two expressions.

Quote:  Fan: Hill creeks in Canterbury and Otago bring a lot of shingle down with them when they are in flood. On steep hillsides this shingle shingle spreads on each side of the creek, narrow at the top and wide at  the bottom. This natural feature is called a fan. In time tussocks grow over the shingle and some large fans of 500 to 1000 or more acres contain very good land. (C.)
