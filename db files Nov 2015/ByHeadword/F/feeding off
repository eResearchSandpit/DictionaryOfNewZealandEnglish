Quote:  On good land where spring growth is vigorous light feeding off of cereals with sheep will prevent lodging, increase tillering, and improve the yield. Hard feeding off, especially on the lighter land, where grazing may not be advisable at all, tends to reduce yields. Feeding off is generally carried out in August if the ground is sufficiently dry .. After feeding off the crop should be tine harrowed to loosen the surface.
