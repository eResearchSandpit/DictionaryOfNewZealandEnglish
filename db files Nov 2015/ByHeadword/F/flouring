Quote:  While on an official visit to the Thames Goldfield I ...[observed] the ... effect of Cyanide of Potassium, in preventing the flouring of mercury used in working the blanketings. These blanketings I found have ... a decidedly acid reaction, due ... to the presence of ferric and ferrous salts ..., and it is to the former ... that what is commonly known as [335] `flouring,' is mainly due, in the process cited above; such ferric salts being able to either oxidize or chloridize the surface of any mercury ..., thus enfilming it with a compound, which being practically insoluble in water ... prevents that metallic contact taking place between detached mercurial globules, which is necessary to amalgamation.
