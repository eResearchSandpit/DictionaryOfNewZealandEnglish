Notes: Jim Cameron writes : NSOD gives "a horizontal band of wood etc. esp as used in an architrave" [i.e. a part surrounding a door or window"]. Collins is similar, as is the definition in Freeland, <i>Architecture in Australia</i>, p. 317. If these (and Salmond) are accurate the NZ meaning appears to differ from the British and Australian. The point may be worth following up.
