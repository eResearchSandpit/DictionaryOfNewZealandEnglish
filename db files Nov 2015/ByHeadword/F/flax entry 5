Quote:  <i>Flax</i>: Phormium Tenax. `The poor man's friend.' This plant, shaped like a giant tussock, was one of the most useful things that grew. The leaves or `blades' were ready-made straps and ropes for almost any purpose. The bush makes an excellent dog-kennel, and many a man has made a comfortable camp under one on a rough night. It is handy to tie a horse to and very good shelter for shorn sheep. The leaves are easily skinned; and the fibre was used for making crackers for stock and bullock whips. The individual plants are called <i>flax bushes</i> and the dried reed stalks (which Maoris and children tied into bundles to make rafts) are  called <i>flax-sticks, koradi</i> ss. o[r] <i>kraddy</i> ss., I suppose a  corrupted Maori word. On native country <i>flax</i> is always a sign of good land. ([1857 Paul Letters from Canterbury], p.96; [1898 Morris Austral-English])

Quote:  flax: New Zealand flax, phormium tenax, a plant that grows in clumps of tall sword-like leaves with strong fibres. Strips of the leaves are woven to make the matting used in village churches and meeting-houses. The fibre had commercial use, and until the depression flax mills and flax-cutters' camps, temporary rough quarters for harvesters, would be found near swamps where the flax grew.
