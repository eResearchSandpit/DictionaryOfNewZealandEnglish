Notes: (from the website Feb 2009) FoMA in Brief - The Federation is easily New Zealand's largest Maori business network with a voluntary membership of Maori Incorporations, Maori Land Trusts, Maori Trusts Boards and Runanga, and emerging communally owned entities. The mission of the network is to progressively foster and promote the development, sound management and the economic advancement of Maori Authorities and in turn the wider Maori communities they benefit.
