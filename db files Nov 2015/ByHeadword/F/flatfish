The Lemon Sole, like the Common Sole, Flounder, Brill and Turbot is a bottom-dwelling fish with both eyes on the upper surface of the body, known as the right side. This fish and the others mentioned are known to fishermen, auctioneers, retailers and the public generally as Flatfish. Skate and Electric-ray are also Flatfish, the upper and lower surfaces being the back and belly.
