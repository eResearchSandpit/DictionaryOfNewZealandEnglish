Quote:  Mr. Simmonds suggests that the marsh-tit would help in the eradication of the flax-grub. But ... the caterpillar of <i>Persectania steropastis</i> (the species which does most of the damage in the South) hides during the day in the sheaths at the bases of the leaves, where no bird could capture it. I believe that the larva of the <i>Xanthorhoe praefectata</i>, the northern flax-moth, also conceals itself during the day.
