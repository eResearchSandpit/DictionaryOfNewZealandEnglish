Quote:  When we returned it was dark - the six tents were all pitched and supplied with "Feathers" (fern in this instance). <i>Ibid.</i> 3 These bunks took up the whole of the tent floor - on them the "Feathers" were placed (red birch twigs) feathered upwards and quills underneath so that the surface when completed showed only leaves & soft twigs.
