Quote:  Sigeyuki Kihara started playing around with well known logos in 1996, when she corrupted a Fab 2 logo on a t-shirt to read Ultra FOB Total (fresh off the boat, geddit?)... Witness a display of t-shirts bearing the words.. Barbie, repackaged as a full-bodied brown babe called FOBIE.

Quote:  So it's brave and cheeky that Kihara has printed T-shirts showing the Colonel sporting the initials "KKK" rather than "KFC". Tip-Top becomes "Hip-Hop" and Fab, the washing powder, becomes "Fob."
