Quote:  At the intersections of cross-veins, flinties, and `flatheads', the mingling of waters that have come from different
Sources ... has resulted in precipitation of the gold and its associated minerals ... [173] ... In the lower levels the patches of highly auriferous ore generally occurred at the intersectons of `flinties' with the veins ...

[82] ... The richer material occurred ... also ... where `cross-heads' or `flinties' joined the main reef.
