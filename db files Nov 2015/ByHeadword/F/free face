Quote:  Blasting: ... [The fuses,] about five feet long, were each cut about half-an-inch longer than the one before it, thus ensuring that none of the holes would be over-burdened and `blow [313] out' in the wrong direction, as any explosion must follow the line of least resistance, which is the shortest distance to a `free face.'
