There were also porina moths (<i>Oxycanus</i> spp.) whose caterpillars also destroyed pastures; the bag moth (<i>Oeceticus omnivorus</i>) which left cigar-shaped cocoons hanging from shrubs and tree [sic]; and the ghost-like white moth ... of the flax grub (<i>Orthoclydon praefectata</i>) which eats longitudinal slits on the surface of [flax] leaves ...
