Quote:  At one time Jacobs leased about 2000 acres of the usually useless [Chatham] Tobacco Country. He wanted it for the fungus that grew so abundantly on the kopi trees which formed the main portion of that forest. This he gathered to export to China. The very large, soft circular fungus could also be induced to grow on logs and roots split open and placed in an old tin shed. There copious watering soon covered everything with the huge white growth and all Jacobs had to do was to pull it off the logs and spread it out to dry. A pile a foot or so high would only yield a few handfuls of dry chips. When ready for packing it had to be damped once more to keep it from turning into powder. It never went mouldy because it was a mould to start with. When first sent abroad the Islanders got 4d. a pound for it, later only 2d. Even at that price they stripped the forests and killed the goose. Jacobs seems to have been the only one who attempted to cultivate it. The Chinese used it for soup (it makes a thick, sticky, rather tasteless fluid when boiled), dressing silk and varnish.
