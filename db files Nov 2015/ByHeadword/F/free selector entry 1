Quote:  Both the aim and the object of those who frame laws in favor of special settlements, free selectors, deferred payment, and small farm associations are admirable ... If a portion of the progress payments is remitted by the state to the Southland free-selectors, the practical result will be that they will ultimately obtain their land for a less price than they originally agreed to pay for it.
