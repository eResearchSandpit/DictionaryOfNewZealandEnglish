Quote:  The last remarks contained in the report with regard to the want of easy access to the back country, and the consequent unfair pressure of the difficulties upon the first settler who endeavours to open up the country, are perfectly just, and the remedy proposed is certainly a practicable one; the only difficulty is the providing of funds, but the work ought to be done.
