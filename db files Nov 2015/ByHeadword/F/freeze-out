Quote:  At the end of the evening someone suggested we finish up with a `freeze out' and this was agreed to. The rules of this form of sport were simple. Each player has to have three threepenny pieces and on the first round all put in one threepence. An ordinary poker hand was then dealt and cards were bought as required. There was no betting as all hands were tabled face up and the man with the worst hand was `frozen out'. All he had to do however, was to put in his second threepence and he was in again. After losing three threepences, however, he was frozen out for good. This

went on until only two players remained and on the final game the winner took the whole kitty!
