Quote:  With the true whales (Balaenoidea)[sic] it has the following characters in common: - Baleen elongate and of fine quality; chest and belly smooth; tympanic bones rhombic; cervical vertebrae anchylosed; mandibular ramus without a coronoid process.  To the finners (or finbacks) [fn. Whalers often speak of right whales as finners or fin-fish, from their yielding baleen or `fin', as they term it. [HWO note: is he implying that right whales are true whales but are also (?mistakenly) called finners by whalers: I don't think so.]] it had the following points of resemblance:- Body elongate and slender, the proportion of head being less than one fourth [253] of the length; has a dorsal fin; pectoral fin lanceolate, moderate, and with four fingers; scapula elongate, with coracoid and acromion processes. Its peculiar characters are the small number of vertebrae, 44; the short mandibles and remarkably broad straight ribs with feeble vertebral articulations.
