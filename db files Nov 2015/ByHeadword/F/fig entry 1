Quote:  `I got six figs for that load of rubbish' Fig was a curious word, an Americanism that had some how filtered into N.Z [sic] penal institutions and survived. It wasn't slang in the sense that screw and boob were. There was no other word for the cellophane packet that contained around fifty grammes of offcuts and substandard tobacco supplied by the companies. Nobody spoke of a  packet of tobacco - it was always a fig.
