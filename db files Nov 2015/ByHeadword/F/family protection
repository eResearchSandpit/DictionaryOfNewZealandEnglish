Notes: Jim Cameron writes : A NZ innovation dating from 1900 (known originally as testators' family maintenance). See Family Protection Act 1908, and now Family Protection Act 1955. A similar scheme in England, introduced in 1926, is known as <i>family provision</i>. (I suspect that in recent popular usage, <i>family protection</i> may relate rather to the protection against violence that is the purpose of the Domestic Violence Act.)

Quote:  Even the Dictionary of New Zealand English (DNZE) (1997) is patchy in its coverage of legal terms, having for example no entry for disputes tribunal, family protection, incorporated society, Maori option, protection order, resource consent.    The most recent edition of Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (1995) is useful but commonly gives specialist   definitions   taken   from   the interpretation sections of statutes
