Notes: [It is popular with children. I heard it first used in 1941 when I came to the North Island to secondary school, and thought it a strange expression, as fair do! was the main form in Havelock. fair go! has a much wider current popular use, as slang or colloq, than any of its  counterparts: fair buck, do, (spin) etc.]
