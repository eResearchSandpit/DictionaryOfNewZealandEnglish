Quote:   This is a seasonal job and gives rise to phrases like: `Chaps winter at a certain job (e.g. shearing) in the off-season, and come back regularly. The season is divided into the flush when lambs are coming in (two flushes `grass-fed' and `rape-fed'). After the first flush of lambs, a lot of sheep come in,  wo-olly iwis [wou li: |i:wi:z] as they are called. they are tougher than lambs and the tally is therefore less - 80 instead of 100 say; and they are often called  grannies or grandmother lambs.
