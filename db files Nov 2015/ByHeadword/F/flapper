Quote:  You ask if we had pancakes on Shrove Tuesday [on the Molyneux diggings]. I do not remember what we had on that day, but if there was no meat to be had, I think it very likely what are called here flappers, that is flour and water mixed up thin and fried. in fat. They are very good with sugar.
