Quote:  If you strike something "fair and square" you strike it accurately and with force. A new meaning had been born - complete(ly), forceful(ly). A woman who tells you she is "fair affronted" is (a) severely insulted and (b) from the north of the UK. This usage has found its way into New Zealand colloquial idiom: " It fair gets me down"; "I feel fair sick when I come to think of it"; and (of course) "It's a fair cow" which takes "fair" a long way from its original sense of "beautiful".
