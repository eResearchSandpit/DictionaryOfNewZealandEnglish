Quote:  Pig-dog types are many ... The writer's [J.P.Lewin's] considered classification is straight finders, straight bailers, straight holders and straight killers. ... Inside it we have finder-bailers; bailer-holders; finder-bailer-holders; bailer-holder-killers and holder-killers.

Quote:  What about giving the lowdown on terms like bailing and finding ... Could you describe the things a good pig dog's required to do? ... There's two types of finders. There's the wind finder and the track finder. The wind finder will take a pig first ... If you've got a good wind finder with you and you're working the right way into the wind, if there's a pig lying anywhere up to 1000 or 1500 yards away he'll be away like a shot ... With a track finder the pig might be on the move and he'll leave a lot of scent on the undergrowth. The dog will immediately pick that up and he'll stick his nose on the ground ... He'll tail off after the pig and stop him some way, nip him in the leg or somewhere else.

Quote:  [The pighunters] had Sandy and Dark, both finders and bailers, to thank for that. <i>Ibid.</i> 156 Pigdogs are classified into three groups: finders, bailers, and holders. The name of each type indicates perfectly what they are expected to do.

Quote:  At the very outer edge of my hearing were sounds, vague and indistinct yet full of portent. That rousing battle cry, the rallying call of the finders, muted now, yet with its message crystal clear,  had come wafting on the freshening breeze.
