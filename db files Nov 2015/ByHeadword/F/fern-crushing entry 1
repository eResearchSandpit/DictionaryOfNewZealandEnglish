Quote:  The first care of the settler was to increase his area of grass by the operation known through Hawke's Bay as `fern-crushing' or `fern-grinding,' - words ominous of the part played by the unfortunate sheep, and which will be described later. It is sufficient now to state that after fire had cleared the tangled bracken growth, the ground was surface-sown and kept clear by browsing sheep. As the greatest growth of fern took place during late spring, it was then impossible to have too many sheep. Every squatter in Hawke's Bay was in the 'eighties `fern-grinding,' so that in those times sheep could not be bought at that season of the year. The result was that every sheep likely to survive the winter was kept, however old and however fleeced. It was at least a pair of jaws, a beast that could bite bracken.

Quote:  But there were no cattle coming up to listen. ... They'd been in there fern crushing, hundreds of acres of bracken. Men'd just walked off that land in the slump but those cattle were breaking it all in again.
