Quote:  Where only a few hoggets are being fed, the racks may be shifted more easily than when fixed to a fence. Indeed, 'fence feeding' which was so popular a few years ago when more or less permanent hay racks were put up along the fence lines, often results in permanent damage being done to good permanent pastures.
