Quote:  On several occasions recently, private Forestry companies have consulted with Forest and Bird branches about logging access protected under the Forest Accord... The Accord was built upon the Tasman Accord, negotiated in 1988 between Forest and Bird and Tasman (now Fletcher) Forests, following lively protest against the company's clear-felling of native forest to plant pine trees. Both accords saw conservationists agree to champion sustainable pine forests, and the forestry companies agree not to plant pine trees at the expense of native forest.
