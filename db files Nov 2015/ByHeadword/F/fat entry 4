Quote:  The new [Heinemann's] dictionary carries: ... mall, ... M.O.W. and o.n.o. ... dropper (for fencing) ... and garage sale. It does not contain diff and carby (which have now moved from slang into general use among at least half the population), leg-in, woolly (as a noun), farmlet, fat (or sharp) sand, nor, amazingly, home-brew.
