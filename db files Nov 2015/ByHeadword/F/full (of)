Quote:  Although, there were plenty of station horses, ... I invested in a couple for my own private use. ... [One] bucked me off more times than I can remember, and I began to get `full' of him. George, my mate, proposed Rarey-fying him. The process consisted in breathing up his nose ... One of Rarey's theories was that the breath of man inhaled into the horse's nostrils intimidated him.
