Quote:  I remember my mother telling me she used to walk to her primary school in Pamerston with her best friend Elizabeth. She would send Elizabeth into the cake shop and wait with a delicious sense of anticipation and a great deal of surprise that she could persuade such a naturally good child to ask for a fly cemetery... My mother was born in 1910, so these events would date to the early 1920s...

Quote:  Fly cemeteries: It's not a name used in cookbooks. There it's always called fruit squares. How boring, compared to fly cemeteries, a name that is original to New Zealand.

Quote:  ...I, too, can remember hearing about fly cemeteries over 50 years ago. I was living with my family in Wellington when my father mentioned that he'd had a fly cemetery for afternoon tea... So maybe it was Eccles cakes in Manchester and fruit squares in Wellington that were given this affectionate nickname.

Quote:  We watched the cakes being iced or filled with cream and if we were lucky we were allowed to choose a cake - my favourite was a "fly cemetery", filled with fruit and enclosed in flaky pastry.
