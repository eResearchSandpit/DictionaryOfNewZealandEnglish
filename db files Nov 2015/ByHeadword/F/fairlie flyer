Quote:  I remember in particular one day we were doing something about the famous train, the Fairlie Flyer, and we were in the Fairlie pub where we got to talk to an old bloke called Mr Siefert... He said 'well, yinno, when I was a young boy at night, yinno, we'd go down to the station, to see who was on the train and have a bit of a yarn.'
