Notes: horse float		Jim Cameron writes: Collins gives this as <i>Austral & NZ</i>. NSOD defines <i>float</i> in this context as a broad level shallow means of transportation and also as a low bodied battery-powered vehicle for delivering milk ("also <i>milk float</i>"). The NZ horse float is a high and narrow trailer. The first NSOD definition describes what in the 309s and 40s was known to me as a milk float - a low flat horse-drawn trailer.

Quote:  One suburban sound of the 1940s, now completely vanished from New Zealand streets, was that of food vendors: the rabbito and the whitebait seller and the clip-clopping hooves of the milko's horse-drawn float - as the milk waggon was called.
