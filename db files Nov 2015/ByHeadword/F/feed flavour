Quote:  While it is pretty well recognised that feed flavours as such will develop in butter, and can be described as characteristic flavours, feed flavours that arise through contamination are a different matter...a dirty milking-machine can create feed flavour. Experiments have isolated the bacterium which causes turnip flavour independently of the purely feed flavour.

Quote:  In the early thirties the pasture section of the then Plant Research Bureau, the Dairy Research Institute and the Morrinsville Dairy Factory collaborated in feed-flavours investigation of the Waikato pastures where the flavours were most intense. There was no doubt about the unpleasantness of these feed flavours in the spring, particularly in home-made farm butter.
