Quote:  There are numerous families of slime fungus in New Zealand, but, unfortunately, they are not particularly easy to find, as they are rather small, and one must look for them in just the right kind of place, and choose moist, damp weather. Of course, they are not confined to the bush; one of them may be discovered in vegetable gardens, for it is parasitic on cabbages, causing the disease known as `fingers and toes.'
