Quote:  In the 'sixties Fairlight was mostly a cattle run, although carrying a number of sheep. There was beautiful feed on the run, the real sweet native vegetation, and the stock were fattened for the big Queenstown market which came into existence when the hungry diggers rushed the goldfields in the Shotover and Arrow districts in 1862. When the cattle were in prime condition they were described as being `as fat as mud.'
