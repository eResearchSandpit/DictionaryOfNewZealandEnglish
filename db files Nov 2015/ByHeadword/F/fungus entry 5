Quote:  Little has been recorded of the bracket fungus  [<i>Polyporus</i>] and its importance in the generation of fire. ... Dr G.B. Cone has spoken to an old Pakeha bushman who has used it in the Thames district where it was known as `punk' to the early settlers, who learned of its use from the Maoris. Punk burns very slowly and persistently. It can be put out only when smothered. ... Punk has now been recognised as the  dried flesh of the <i>Polyporus hosularus </i>which may be found in many parts of the North Island.
