Quote:  in trade, selling land, or selling their produce, no Jew of Monmouth Street can deal with more cunning or more persevering importunity; nothing is done, however slight, without demanding the  ootu or payment, and, if instead of higgling, you at once give what is asked, they [Maoris] become uneasy at having made such a boko keeno (trade bad).

Quote:  A. Maori contexts. Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward,  price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating  the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English  a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English  hoot, parallels that of toot from  tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842:  Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `in  pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable. According to the u, utu, etc., are pronounced as if spelt hu, hutu.'.
