Definition:G.B. and ireland; esp. and gen. England : Colonial, prob first in U.S. (cf Thornton) in 18c. : 20c Aust and NZ esp. go, at home.]  (it is perhaps possible to distinguish among the earliest recorded uses, a specific reference to England, rather than other parts of the British isles, or to the British isles themselves. This would be expected, as most early Company settlers were English born. My evidence suggests that 1840-1860 usage was mainly by settlers in Canterbury, Nelson, and Wellington. There seems no early evidence of its use in Otago.) By the first settlers, and the early generations of colonially born, England; the British isles; the Old Country; the mother country; one's home country. A. Referring to the homeland left. 1. a. Chiefly `England'. (i) initial cap. [?more freq. proportionally after WW1].

Quote:  When i presumed to take on the cloak you [Buck] dropped ... and in the borrowed mantle essayed to climb Hikurangi and so catch ... views of the local conflict i was amazed that so much progress had been made in winning the regard ... of the `pakeha'. The generation for which the New Zealand Herald catered in leading articles had almost passed away. Your lectures throughout New Zealand had set the best minds among the pakeha at work. With that generation also had largely passed the pakeha who was wedded to the idea of England being `Home'. The native born New Zealand pakeha is looking nearer to his native heath for objects of study, literary effort and missionary care.

He really meant the British isles with England predominant. ... i don't think of England as Home. ... if there's any `Home' for me in that sense, it's ireland. But this country is our real home. ... in thinking of England as `Home', Philip was typical of his countrymen.
