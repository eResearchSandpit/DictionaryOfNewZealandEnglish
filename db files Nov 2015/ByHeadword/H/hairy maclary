Quote:  After a hard day rehearsing or performing the Hairy Maclary Hootenanny, singer and entertainer Jackie Clarke returns home to her two-year-old son Stan. And what does Stan want mum to read her [sic]? Hairy Maclary of course... Clarke first encountered Hairy Maclary a few years ago when approached.. to sing a couple of songs, including Slinky Malinki, Open the Door and the theme song for a recording.
