Quote:  Now, to become a member of the League the sum of 2s 6d has to be planked down, and as quite a number of ardent Chow-haters have `come to light' with their `half-dollars,' it would be interesting to know from Mr. Cameron himself where the money goes.

Quote:  The present colloquial or slang use of dollar, usually in  half a dollar, `half a crown' in New Zealand, but in Australia, where half-crowns are not in use, two shillings, should help the natural adoption of the new official term dollar.

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and

two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.
