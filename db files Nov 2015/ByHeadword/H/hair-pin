Quote:  The owner neither swore nor raised his voice as he replied, `The horse is in the stall; just go and take him, too, saddle and all, you mongrel.' That boy is waiting to get even, and the owner vows when he does, he will provide a patient for the hospital, and he is just the hair-pin that will keep his word.
