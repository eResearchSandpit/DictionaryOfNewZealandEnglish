Quote:  A haggle is a bet between the players on a round of golf, part of the money allocated to the winner(s) of the first nine holes, part to the second nine (this amount may be doubled by the losers of the first nine), and part to the overall winner(s). Currently on Karori Golf Course: 50c, 50c, $1. Sometimes money is played for on each hole, but i dont think this is part of a haggle.

Quote:  Haggle is used on Judgeford Golf Course (Pauatahanui) for playing for a small prize which all concerned share in but which losing team pays for - the whole process is called a haggle. `Are we going to have a wee haggle on the match.'
