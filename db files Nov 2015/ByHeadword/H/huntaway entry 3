Quote:  A huntaway should be a free-running dog, noisy, and under good command, and should lose points for not taking directions readily, insufficient noise, being too rash or too slow, and not keeping the sheep on a good course.

Quote:  Sheep dog.- Dog to work sheep; collie (q.v.). S.ds. run naturally either to bring sheep towards you or to drive them away; and when a puppy shows his preference he is broken in for that work. The dogs that  bring sheep are called heading ds. (q.v.) and most of these can be  taught to lead (q.v.) if desired. Dogs which take to driving sheep away are broken in to huntaway and are called htwys (q.v.). Some dogs will both hd. and htwy and are called handy ds. They are not generally high-class heading dogs but very useful about hand and sometimes very useful mustering dogs. Some men have a special  slewing d., but a well-trained, hdg. dog or htwy. will usually slew (q.v.). (C.)

Quote:  The huntaway sheep dog is a New Zealand development. Original imported strains were all heading dogs whose instinctive method was to head the sheep and, working silently, to pull them back to their masters. Early New Zealand shepherds, however, needed the occasional noisy dog which could flush sheep from cover on rough country. ...  Huntaway: A noisy dog, whose natural instinct is to hunt or chase sheep away. On account of their noise, they are used for forcing mobs, work in the sheep yards, and for clearing or hunting sheep off tracts of country.

Quote:  The Beardie was developed as a barking dog because in some parts of Scotland, particularly in the Western Highlands, much of the ground is covered with bracken, which combined with the deep gullies known as corries, makes it impossible for a heading dog to see his sheep. Here the

shepherd has to get out above the sheep and more or less chase them out of the thick cover. These dogs were known as hunters, and it is presumably an adaptation of this name which led to the designation, huntaway. At the turn of the century there were four well known strains of huntaways about North Canterbury and Marlborough - the Clown, Rag, Borderglen's Rose and Pollock's Old Clyde breeds. Of these the Clown strain certainly had Beardie blood, believed to have been started with a half Beardie brought out from Scotland.
