Quote:  But, alas, from her came no godlike son, but only the Hara-keke, the flax plants, the stalwart dwellers of the swamp lands and the stiff sentinels of the river banks. in the summer Hara-keke sends up a rigid stalk bearing on each side of it dull red flowers, flowers which are even yet `sweet with the honey of a god's vain love.'

Quote:  Outside the home of every self-respecting irish peasant in days gone by would be a small patch of flax, grown to be spun and woven into linen for household use.

When Europeans arrived in New ZXealand, they called harakeke "flax" because its fibres are similar to those of Linum.
