Quote:  Many trampers today like the flexibility of planning their own routes, of not having the pace set by others. Some are put off by the "hisser" mentality, which is apparently still alive in some clubs. Hissers sprint from point to point, seeing nothing. At the hut they bore everyone senseless with their boasts about record times.

Quote:  Visitors to Wellington comment on the brisk pace of the pedestrians, and Wellington trampers  have achieved a certain notoriety for the speed with which some of them travel in the hills. it is not surprising,  therefore, that its hillmen and hillwomen should hiss along, that hissers and little hissers should flourish, and that little hisser should sometimes be used as a term of approbation - `stew a  hisser', `a real hisser of a day'. The Tramper first gives to hiss in 1934, and hisser with reference to a stew appears on 1940, but to a person not until 1943, though it must have been so used long before.
