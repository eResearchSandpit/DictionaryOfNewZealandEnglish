Quote:  An outsider might guess that our weather in the hills was almost always bad, to judge by the characteristic expressions used. The derisive phrases, `Send it down, Hughie' and `Let it come down, Hughie', go back to early in this century and are variants of the British military catch-phrase `Send it down, David'. `Send her down, Hughie', common in Australia's droughty climate, may not be so derisive. Judging by a verse attached to Dekker's Shoemaker's Holiday, St. Hugh has long been associated with rain.

Quote:  in indigenous slang the nearest to a religious concept  is the use of Hughie in Send her down, Hughie said to the source of rain <i>ibid.</i> 162 Miss Mason observes that St Hugh is associated with rain in a song in Dekker's  Shoemaker's Holiday ..but here `HUgh' seems to be protection against weather rather than a cause of it, and

St Hugh was the patron saint of shoemakers in any circumstances. [This sounds like crap: ??evidence. Surely Crispin was p.s. of shoemakers. iAG trots this too, probably from here.]

Quote:  send her down, Hughie! (and ..., Steve!) This Australian - hence also New Zealand - c.p. of late

C19-20, the Steve variant being used during WW1, expresses a fervent desire for rain. (AS.) Variations of  the next, her for it being characteristically Australian.  send it down, David (with variant Davy lad)! The variant belongs  to the Regular Army: and the basic send it down,

David is often intensified by the addition of  a repetitive send it down: late C19-20. in the army. esp. during WW1, it was used to implore David, the Welsh patron saint, to send a preferably very heavy shower, notably when it might cause a parade to be postponed or cancelled. Parts of Wales have a notoriously wet climate: and, what is more, Wales is the `Land of Leeks' (leaks). Both F & G and B & P are eloquent about this cp.
