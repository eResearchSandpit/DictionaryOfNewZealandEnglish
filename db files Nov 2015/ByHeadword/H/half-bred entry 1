Quote:  At each place which i have visited, i have been assured that the Maories are dying rapidly -

`perishing like rotten sheep,' these people often say; thus at Kurreroo or Molineux, where there are now half-a-dozen natives, they say that formerly, and at no remote period, about two generations previous to the present, there were above a thousand; and in many other places within the last sixteen years, which is about the extent of the experience of the older beachers, there has been, in many places, a corresponding diminution of numbers. if this is an unexaggerated statement, it is a very distressing one to reflect on. Since Dr. -- visited this settlement, one of the residents, Mr. --, an educated man, has opened a school for half-bred or any other children, and the progress which the children have already made is very encouraging.
