Quote:  The old time hay box was a good servant. A deepish box filled with good dry hay enveloped a cold lamb and its properties of heat and revival had to be experienced to be credited. i have sometimes at night given a stud lamb up for lost, left it in a hay box on the laundry floor and gone to bed, to be awakened in the small hours by the bleat of a lamb wanting milk.
