Quote:  The Golden Kiwi was established partly to prevent money being sent out of New Zealand for tickets in Tatt's, a Tasmanian lottery with a name abbreviated from Tattersall's and quite unconnected with the English cant word tatts `dice'. it was illegal to sell tickets in Tatt's in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which was

universally understood.... it was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.
