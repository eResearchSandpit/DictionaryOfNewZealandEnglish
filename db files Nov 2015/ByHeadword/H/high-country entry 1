Quote:  The speech of the men is a slow drawl, sometimes flavoured with Scotch burr ... [fn] High country slang on sheep runs has national characteristics such as referring to a man as a `joker', and using the adjective 'crook' to describe bad weather or ill health, eg `i felt crook on the day the crook weather brought the river up'. Regional slang is also of interest, such as use of `dag' (literally wool fouled with sheep's dung) to mean a `hard case' or unusual character, with an implication of approval, even of admiration. `Rooster' is another variant of `joker'.
