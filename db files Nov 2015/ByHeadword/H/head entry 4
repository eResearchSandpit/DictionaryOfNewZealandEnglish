Quote:  ~ (1) People do not as a rule say (e.g.) `fifty cattle'  but `fifty h. of cattle'. Up country people usually confine this idiom to cattle and sometimes horses. But i see to-day in `The Press' (June 27, 1933)  the editor speaks of a decrease of so many h. of sheep disclosed by this year's sheep return. (C.) (2) A dog goes round to the far side of  a mob of sheep and stops them. This is called heading. Hence  heading dog, one whose work this is. if he does it neatly he  makes a good h See also sheep dog. 3. The owner would say, `i can  head with him'.(C; [1874 Kennaway Crusts],p. 45)
