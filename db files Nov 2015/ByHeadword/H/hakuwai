Quote:  Many legends are associated with the mythical bird "hokioi"... in the South and in some parts of the North island it is identical, apparently, with the "hakuwai" which has seven joints in its wing, lives in the sky, and presages trouble... "its cry was Hokioi! Hokioi! Hu!" The last word represented the whizzing sound made by the bird in flight.

Quote:  The Mysterious Ha-ka-wai Bird [heading] No-one has ever seen it, no-one knows what it is like. Mutton-birders who have heard the strange sound of its passing over the islands at night speak of the ha-ka-wai bird. A swish of wings close overhead, a sound like the rattle of chains when a boat lets the anchor down, again the sound of wingbeats and the cry floating earthward from the heavens,  Ha-ka-wai! Ha-ka-wai! in a drawn-out singsong with accent on the first and last syllables.

Quote:  A strange bird in Maori eyes is the hakuai of the off-shore islands in the far south. ... Whole families go mutton-birding ... At night the fowlers gather round their camp-fires, and old songs are sung ... and ghost-stories retold. And in the darkness sometimes they hear the ghost-bird screaming its `Haku-ai, haku-ai, Ooh!' and then a hair-raising swoosh of great wings ... This bird, called the `hakuai' from its call, is spoken of as a spirit. ... The mystery of the  hakuai may be dispelled by assuming it to be ... the  frigate-bird (Fregata aquila).

Quote:  The Maori word <i>hakuwai</i> (or <i>hakawai</i> or <i>hakuai</i>, or any of at least five other variant spellings, including the European <i>harkowhy</i>) was defined by Williams in his <i>Maori Dictionary</i> as 'an extinct bird heard at night'.

Quote:  it is a moot point whether the name <i>hakuwai</i> was derived from <i>hokioi</i>.. or whether <i>hokioi</i> has been adopted., as an imperfect rendition of <i>hakuwai</i>, to provide a name for the eagle legend.

Quote:  He heard the harkowhy up in Canaan on the Takaka Hill, the ghost-bird never seen but many times heard by muttonbirders and the odd fisherman in the mist and fog in Stewart island, crying like a chain rattling.
