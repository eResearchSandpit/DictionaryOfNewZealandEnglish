Notes: Jesse Sheidlower (jester@panix.com) says a quick US search turned up this term in 1989 (<i>Chicago Tribune</i> Nov. 23, p. C26 "Suburb Cops Zero in on Ring Involved in Home Invasions" and believes there would be much earlier examples; his earliest was a 1978 article in a trade magazine about credit cards. Michael Proffitt (mproffitt@oup.co.uk) has this from 1988 Sara Paretsky <i>Toxic Shock</i> (1990) xxix. 214 "The steel-lined door I'd had installed after my last home invasion had held" and says they have Canadian evidence from 1993 and "home invasion" and "home invader" from Australian newspapers from 1994 onwards. Wayne Glowka (Georgia College & State University; wglowka@mail.gcsu.edu) has a Canadian usage from 1997 <i>Globe and Mail</i> 9 Dec. p. A7 "The terms home invasion or reesidential robbery surfaced in Winnipeg about 18 months ago after a series of violent break-ins where seniors, who happened to be at home at the time, were injured." He also quotes a correspondent who says the term has been common in British Columbia for perhaps 10 years.
