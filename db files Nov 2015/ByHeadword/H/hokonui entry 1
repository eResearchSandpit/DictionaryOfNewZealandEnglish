Quote:  [NB: invercargill went dry at 10 p.m., 30 June 1906 to 1946] There is nothing unpleasant or poisonous about the genuine `Hokonui' manufactured in the forest of the mountain range from

which its name is derived. it sells at a price considerably lower than the imported article on which duty was paid, and some connoisseurs regard it as better than Scotland's best.'
