Quote:  i had often heard of men who, living together and close pals for many years, suddenly develop a distaste for each other and even hate the sound of each other's voices. i had read the works of Bret Harte and other American writers, with frequent reference to the distaste and even hate which was dubbed `Hut Fever,' and i actually knew one of such a party.
