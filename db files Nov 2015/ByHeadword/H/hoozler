Quote:   ... the track dangerous with challenge - from the `dark hoozler' who could leave one struggling at the last bog ... as he disappeared into the Turere, or, greater humiliation, to be left behind by the graceful feminine figure of the `Red Terror' ... whose ... speed embarrassed many a husky male.
