sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. it is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. it is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy
