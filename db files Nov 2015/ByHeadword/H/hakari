Quote:  Hakari - this word referrred to the foodstand on which were displayed huge and varied amounts of food that a group was prepared to give its visitors, in order to maintain and increase their prestige or `mana'. (q.v.) The host group would make large personal sacrifices in order to feed visitors, and such sacrifice increased the sense of sharing both among hosts and between hosts and guests. Hakari now refers to the feast itself.
