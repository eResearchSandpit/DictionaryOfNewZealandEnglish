Quote:  in the furrow method of irrigation small furrows or corrugations are made in the direction of the slope and connected with a head-ditch supplying water .. Water is taken from the head-ditch, which follows approximately the contour of the surface, into the distributing-furrows, which may be parallel with the ditch or diverge from it. in turning the water from the head-ditch into the furrows the common practice in Central Otago is to make openings in the lower bank with a shovel.
