Quote:  Mr. Fyfe had found a moa's egg, at the Kai Koras, while digging the foundation for his store. it is a foot long, about 6 inches in diameter, and 27 inches in circumference. The shell is the 16th part of an inch in thickness. A hole is drilled in the end of it, and the egg must have been considered of great value by the natives, as it was found deposited at the head of a skeleton, with a number of very large poenamu axes. Mr. Fyfe, we understand, is going to send them home to the British Museum.
