Quote:  Watty [the Tarndale cook] fed us again, chops and more chops. He called them `hockey-stocks'[sic: ? misprint hockey-stick]; but there was never anything in the world more toothsome than that merino mutton, killed a week previously and hung in the clear, rarefied air of the Tarndale uplands. <i>ibid.</i>32 We were tired, and ate our two `hockey sticks' in silence, and big lunches, expecting a hard day.
