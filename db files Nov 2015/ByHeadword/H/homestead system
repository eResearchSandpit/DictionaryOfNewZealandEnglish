Quote:  HOMESTEAD SYSTEM. [heading] Under this system the settler makes no payment for the land, the only cost to him being the expenses of survey. On the fulfilment of conditions, which are five years' residence, the erection of a house, and the cultivation of one-third of the selection if open land, and one-fifth if bush-land, the Crown grant is issued.
