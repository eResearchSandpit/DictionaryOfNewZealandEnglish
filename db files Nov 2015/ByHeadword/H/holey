Quote:  `Treasure' i played ringie and holie. i played funs and keeps. i had pee-wees and bully taws and changers that weren't made of glass mind you. And i won nearly every game because the kids were so dazzled by the look of my stinkers. ... They came for miles to play marbles with me ...

Quote:  There is only one record of a New Zealand game in which a formal penalty element entered. This was a game of marbles called Dumps and was played at Wakefield in 1875. in this game the loser, in a marble game of Holey, was required to hold his marble partially exposed between the fingers of his closed fist [for others to shoot at].

Quote:  in the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (in more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.
