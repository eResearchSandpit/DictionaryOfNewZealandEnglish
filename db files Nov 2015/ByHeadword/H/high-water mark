Quote:  `High-water marks' are relentlessly disclosed and the miscreants lined up on the floor to the great delight of their Pharisaical brethren. `Necks!' shouts Hauraki ... Raima is certainly running no risks this morning ... annulling for ever my oft-repeated aspersion that he  never washed his neck.
