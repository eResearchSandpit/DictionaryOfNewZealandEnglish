Quote:  A recent stocktake by the Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC) concluded politely but damningly: "The health reforms of the 1980s and 1990s led to a decreasing emphasis on centralised workforce planning and a view that planning should reside with health sector employers, with the market ensuring optimal outcomes..."  One of the very reasons she created HWAC (pronounced H-whack) last year was to set up a planning mechanism independent of the ministry. HWAC is now written into legislation as a permanent committee.
