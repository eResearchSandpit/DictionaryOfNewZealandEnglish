Quote:  The Pakeha was much too valuable an animal in those days to be killed and eaten; that game did not pay at all. Cannibal feasts did come off now and again on the sly, but the Pakeha was too dear a morsel, and moreover, was far too salt to be put into a Hangi (native oven) for epicurean Maories. <i>ibid.</i> Bk2/6/107 ... the steam was just arising from their hangis as these were being uncovered, and we were all soon served, each with a little freshly-plaited flax-leaf basket filled with most deliciously cooked kumeras, potatoes and peppies.
