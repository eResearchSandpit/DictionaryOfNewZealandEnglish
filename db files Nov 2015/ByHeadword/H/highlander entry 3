Quote:  So far, the lambs have been mainly sourced from Rissington's client list - farmers using the Hawke's Bay Company's Finn-Texel-Romney maternal composite sheep called Highlander.... "Most of the farmers who have Highlanders are so impressed with them they are holding on to as many lambs as they can to build up their flocks."
