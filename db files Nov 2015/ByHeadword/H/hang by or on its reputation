Notes: ca1949 Kaitaia, of physical objects (R. Mason) ca1949 (Wellington) A man describing a nearly-amputated finger as `hanging by its reputation'.  ca1972 July The JBL industrial group, which had gone into receivership, described as `hanging on its reputation for more than a year before the crash'.  (The last usage perhaps illustrates the acceptance of the phrase in N.Z. idiom, when its literal meaning can be revived to counterpoint its traditional idiomatic use, in a kind of quasi-pun. A number of years ago, during a discussion of an English murderer's appeal to commute his death sentence, I recall someone remarking drily that the condemned man `had no show. He was hanging merely on his reputation').
