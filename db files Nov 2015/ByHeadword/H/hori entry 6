Quote:  (John C. Mcab) Brown and white there were no differences between the colours then [in WW2]. The happy members of the 28th Battalion referred to themselves as `horis' (i've never known what the word meant, but now to use it is as big an insult as for a white to be called a Pakeha), and spoke of `Maori time' (some time) and `Maori PT' (lying on one's bedroll) and we followed their lead, not knowing that they, and we, were using such appallingly insulting terms to the Maori race that a special Race Relations Conciliator would have to be installed to quell them.
