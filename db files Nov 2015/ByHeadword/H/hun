Quote:  Anyone could be a Hun - a peevish cow, a blowfly in the meatsafe, the stove that wouldn't light. it was also a cover word for all foreigners... The more expensive of the Chinese fruiterers achieved notoriety as Ah Hun... Many of the foreigners were pleasant, industrious, decent people. in this case they were merely 'a bit of a Hun'.
