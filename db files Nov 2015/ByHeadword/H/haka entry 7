Quote:  haka, general term for a posture-dance; dance with song and action: usually supposed to mean a war-dance; but the real earth-shaking and nerve-shattering war-dance is peruperu, with its savage gesturing, eye-glaring, and cries demoniac, the savagest-looking of which may be in pure fun and intended as a hearty welcome. Both vowels must be short; h&amacr.ka and hak&amacr. differ altogether in meaning: there is no word h&amacr.k&amacr..
