Quote:  Having been settled and stocked with sheep since the mid-1800s, much of the land between the Awatere Valley and Hanmer had been devastated by intensive grazing, rabbits and burn-offs, which exacerbated erosion, and encourage the spread of weeds such as sweet briar, hawkweed and broom, all of which remained a problem.
