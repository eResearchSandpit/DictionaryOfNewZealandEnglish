Quote:  Some Telecom linesmen are stealing push-button telephones from their employers and illegally installing them in the homes of friends ... for a [dollar]50 fee. Most of the jobs, which Telecom linesmen call `homers', involve replacing an old dial telephone with two push-button models, one on an extension.
