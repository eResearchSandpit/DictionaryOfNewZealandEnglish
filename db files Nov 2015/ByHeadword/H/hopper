Quote:  He was what is termed in mining phraseology, a `hatter', - meaning one who works by himself. ... Alone and unaided he scooped the wash-dirt into his cradle, which he vigorously rocked with his left hand, whilst with the right he ladled water from the river into the `hopper' or seive [sic]. ... He cast aside the `dipper', and hastened towards the eddy.
