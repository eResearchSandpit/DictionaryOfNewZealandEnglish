The hook is used for raising the gum from the deeper and wetter swamps. it is a rod of iron perhaps twelve feet long, looped at one end for a handle, and with the last three feet of the other turned off at right angles  and given its own peculiar shape.

Quote:  The hook was used for drawing up nuggets of gum from the depths of swamps, after location by the spear. The hook consisted of a galvanised pipe an inch or so in diameter, equipped at one end with a spade handle, and at the other end with a steel `toe,' about an inch and a half in length, welded to the pipe, and forming the `hook'. it is said that expert diggers could bring up with ease gum of various sizes from great depths.
