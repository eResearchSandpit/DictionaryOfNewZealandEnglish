Quote:  i hadn't been in detention long when i heard his name mentioned ...He hadn't gone to jail with the first group ...They reckoned he'd stuck to his religion all through and the Hoons [(fn) non - religious groups] gave me the impression that he took his religion seriously ... you couldn't take much notice of the Hoons of course, not about a thing like that. Most of them just lumped the religoes together ... . <i>ibid.</i>  164 There was a sort of line drawn in the [detention] camps betwen the Hoons and the religoes. ... The religoes were divided again into God knows how many sects and amongst the hoons were absolute pacifists, pacifists, Communists, Anarchists, humanists, and plain dodgers.

Quote:  `i'm lucky to be here [in a detention camp for conscientious objectors]. Reckon they must have got me mixed up with the Hoons. i'd be much worse off in a regular gaol.' `Are all the men here pacifists?' ... / `But you'd have a job getting anything like a consensus out of the lot we've got here. Some are war resisters- ... Then there are the Christians. ... They're still trying to work out how the hell they landed up [here] ... The majority are Hoons - military defaulters. Against war for reasons of sanity and humanity, not out of religious conviction.
