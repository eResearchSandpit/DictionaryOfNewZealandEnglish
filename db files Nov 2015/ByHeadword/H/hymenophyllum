Quote:  Though ferns are not absolutely [83] peculiar, ... - from the great arborescent species ..., the lovely todea  (<i>Leptopteris superba</i>), down to the exquisite little <i>Hymenophyllum</i>? - a most characteristic feature of the forest scenery.

Quote:  The Gleichenias [51] are a very distinct kind, with their ladder-like fronds set in umbrella shape. Hymenophyllums, or filmy Ferns, are very curious. Adiantums, or Maiden-hairs, are in infinite variety. The Todeas are very beautiful, especially <i>Todea superba</i>, which is commonly called Prince of Wales' Feather.
