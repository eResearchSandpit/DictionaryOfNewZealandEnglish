Quote:  The implication for the Hautawan stage (pre-<i>Gephyrocapsa sinuosa</i>  according to Edwards 1976) are uncertain since we do not yet know enough about its planktic micro-fauna at the type locality, but the indication of a longer survival of the <i>Chlamys</i> in Wairarapa and the southern Dannevirke district suggest that the stage, if recognised by the presence of <i>C. delicatula</i>, is not a reliable correlation unit.
