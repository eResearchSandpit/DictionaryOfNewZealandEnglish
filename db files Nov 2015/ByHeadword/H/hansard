Quote:  Hansard takes its name from the Hansard family, which ran one of the many private-sector companies producing reports on House of Commons debates in the early  [60] 19th century. At the time, no official record was kept of what was said in debates, only of decisions made. Where the Hansards made their name was by producing their reports more quickly than their competitors did.
