Quote:  .. using it ostentatiously whenever i hear someone making an unnecessary fuss.  And i have received two messages both from South island males, recalling a howly-bag was a woman who wept too much.  Heather Hapeta .. chimed in with an e-mail saying "howly-bag" had been in her family since the mid-1970's, meaning cry-baby.  The setting she recalls, was in Maori groups in Christchurch.
