Quote:  The larvae [of longhorn beetles] are timber-borers. The huhu,  <i>Prionoplus reticularis</i>, also known as `horny bug', `crusty back' and `hum-bug' in adult life, is said to be a toothsome morsel in the grub stage-but should not be washed down with alcohol as its tissues already carry a fair amount from the wood it consumes.
