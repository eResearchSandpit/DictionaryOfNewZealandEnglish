Jim quietly replied `Thanks for your advice, but i do not want any information from `hobos' nor even from `quadroons'.'  `Hell! call me a half-caste?' flushed the main offender, sitting opposite. ...  `Dad is very taken with you, and with the fact that you skittled those Maori hobos has tremendously advanced your stocks. ...'
