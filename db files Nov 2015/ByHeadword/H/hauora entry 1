Quote:  Ever since the hauora took over tiny Te Puia Springs Hospital in 1999 and saved it from closure by the government, it has been a critical part of East Coast life. From the birthing facility to palliative care for the elderly, the hauora provides cradle to grave healthcare and employs 160 people.
