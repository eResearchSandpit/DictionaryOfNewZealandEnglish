Quote:  Within minutes of play starting Hopoate was written indelibly and ever so elegantly into the language, A quite bad shot brought the threat, with the appropriate gesture, of a one-finger hopo. A rank short bowl was a two-finger hopo, an appalling misjudgment of a shot a three-finger hopo...Then the skip... looked stricken, turned ashen-faced and disappeared at unusual speed into the club-house - proof-positive the hopo is here to stay as the ultimate deterrent to poor play in any sport.
