Quote:  The back country of New Zealand contains a heritage of about 1400 huts that is unequalled anywhere in the world. These huts were built for the following reasons: wild animal control (~750) sheep mustering (~500) recreation (~150) a range of other purposes including prospecting, scientific studies and castaway sustenance. Others began life as schools and homes and later became huts. These huts have heritage value as the only physical remnant of these activities. ... DOC is identifying a representative selection of key historic huts that can be managed long term to conserve this heritage and allow its appreciation. it is intended to have interpretation signs provided for each historic hut.
