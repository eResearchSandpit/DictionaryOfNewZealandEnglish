Quote:  increasing use of haylage - a hay silage which is sufficiently nutritious to allow cows to continue lactating - has changed the business in a big way. While hay has to be dried out, haylage can be baled a day or two after cutting.

Quote:  [Hdg] Handy haylage. Empty hay sheds are becoming a familiar sight on lower North island farms as farmers discover the convenience of haylage... Haylage is plastic wrapped in convenient bales, keeping it preserved for longer... Haylage is simple to make. There is no pit to dig as there is for silage and the cut grass is only left lying for 24 hours.
