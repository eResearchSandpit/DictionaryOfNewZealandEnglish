Quote:  hosed off fed up; perhaps from being hosed with water, just possibly connected with English late-C16 colloquialism `in my other hose', expressing refusal or disbelief. Current usage would be: `was i hosed off when the first decent shower of rain brought down the wooden retaining wall i'd spent a whole day building.'
