Quote:  in our ranks was a very hard-headed gentleman by the name of Jensen who, on arriving at the pub, breasted up to the bar and ordered a `hangman's blood'. The barman confessed total ignorance of just what this drink might comprise. He was told to produce a beer handle, which

he did, and was then ordered to go along [17] the entire length of the bar, putting in one nip of whatever spirits were on display. Now at that time spirits were very hard to come by, but Paul Rabone, the proprietor of the Mangatara Hotel, seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. Doing as he was bid the barman proceeded from one end to the other, putting in such things as scotch, gin, bacardi, rum, creme de menthe, and so on. He finally returned to the prospective quaffer of this incredible beverage with the beer mug about quarter-full of a purplish looking liquid. `Now,' said Jensen, `Fill it up with beer.'
