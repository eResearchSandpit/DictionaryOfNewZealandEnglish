Notes: Jim writes NZPOD (but not DNZE) records this extended NZ use. In BritE it seems to be limited in this sense to what we would specifically call a <i>front hall</i> - an area into which the front door opens. I can support this by an anecdote of a minor domestic catastrophe. My wife (who grew up in England) asked my son to strip the wallpaper in the hall, by which she meant the front hall. He did this but went on to deal with a passage at the top of the stairs!
