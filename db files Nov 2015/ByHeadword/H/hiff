Quote:  Jennifer Green writes that in the 1960s "hiff" was often used when discarding an unwanted item. She even knew of a very large cupboard called The Hiffin, where one hiffed anything that had no other obvious lodging-place. So the magic word "hiff" is not only a South island colloquial verb after all.
