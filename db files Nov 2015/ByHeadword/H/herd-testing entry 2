Quote:  A cow with `a good test', that is, milk rich in butterfat, may be more valuable than another cow that gives more milk.

This process is called herd-testing. ... it is still not decided whether the word is hyphenated or not. i find it without a hyphen in a publication of the Department of Agriculture in 1950,  with a hyphen in a textbook of dairying in 1955. Pronunciation is with one stress, on herd. <i>ibid.</i> 149 in New Zealand, everyone uses

the term herd-testing, not  milk-testing, because everyone thinks of the dairy industry from a producer's, not a consumer's, point of view.
