Quote:  i don't profess to know who first coined the "House of Pain"

phrase for Carisbrook, but it is certainly not the first major stadium to boast this moniker. in the 1980s the Houston Astrodome was similarly labelled, in recognition of an intimidating defensive line sported by the Houston (now Tennessee) Oilers of the NPL.

Quote:  Apparently one team were valiantly going down into the House of Pain - which, to me - suggests nothing so much as the glorious vision of an opposing phalanx of dental nurses, drills and Bertie Germ posters at the ready.

Quote:  [Two correspondents] wonder why the Dunedin rugby ground, Carisbrook, is called "The House of Pain." Otago rugby historian Dave McLaren says that several people claim to have coined the nickname, but the most likely person is ex-player (and children's book author) Brent Pope. Apparently, some time in the mid to late 80s, Pope was heard to exclaim, after a particularly hard training run inflicted on them by coach Laurie Mains, "Why the hell do we keep coming to this bloody house of pain?" it went public on September 27, 1992, when North Harbour coach Brad Mourant said much the same thing in his after-match function speech.

Quote:  it is often assumed that the phrase [sc. the "House of Pain"] came to be applied by visiting teams because of the perceived difficulty of winning at Carisbrook. it actually began, however, in the late 1980s within the Otago team when players referred to Carisbrook as the House of Pain, because of exhausting training sessions. it was once attributed to an Otago player of the time, Brent Pope, and he happily claimed the credit for it, but it's difficult to pin down to one person. it's only in recent years that it's been seen as the House of Pain for visiting teams - a belief encouraged by Radio Sport (which began in 1998) commentators who had little or no acquaintance with either the ground or the phrase.
