Quote:  Jack's Hut, near the summit of Arthur's Pass, is a rare surviving example of the roadmen's huts that dotted New Zealand's highest altitude main highway. Each roadman was responsible for maintaining a section of the road - clearing slips, filling in potholes - and lived with his family in a hut along his stretch.
