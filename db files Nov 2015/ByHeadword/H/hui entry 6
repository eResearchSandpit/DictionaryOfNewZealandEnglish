Quote:  Hui - `meeting together'. Huis may be held for various reasons, but the main ones are that they give the opportunity for continued social interaction of both sexes, young and old; they allow Maoris the opportunity to keep alive precious traditions (eg, song, dance, oratory, spirituality) and remember the past. Huis allow large numbers to meet and come to a consensus.
