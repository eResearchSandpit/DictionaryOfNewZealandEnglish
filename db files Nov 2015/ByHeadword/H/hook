Quote:  The fern is fired; if it burns well, all the thick and matted dead stuff at the bottom.. will be consumed, leaving only the shrivelled 'Tutu'; and the cane-like fern stalks.. should be cut at once with a strong hook, or better still, with a short scythe, and the 'Tutu' slashed down with a bill-hook.
Notes:  Quoted from HURSTHOUSE 1849
