Quote:  On the front page of The Post (March 18) is a picture of a Chatham island spider known as the hunter and found mainly on South East or Rangatira island, southeast of Pitt island. This island was once used as a sheep station and the person who was in charge of the island told us as children that these spiders kill birds' chicks and eat them.
