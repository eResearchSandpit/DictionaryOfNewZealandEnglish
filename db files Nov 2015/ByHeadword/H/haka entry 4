Quote:  Everywhere you look, and for any reason they can think of, there's some people doing the "hukka", as it's now called. Given our love of this ritual, i'm surprised we don't have a national hukka tournament, from which a national team would be chosen. They would represent us at international competitions dressed in traditional apparel and be called the All Flax.
