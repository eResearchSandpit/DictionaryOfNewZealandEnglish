Quote:  Another matter touching on the recurring annoyance of vernacular names is that up till 1891 <i>Lotella rhacinus</i> was universally accepted as the hake: then, in 1912, Waite, for no apparent reason, transfers this name to <i>Merluccius gayi</i>, although he admits that the records of

these fish were hopelessly mixed on the expedition. ...

Quote:   Hake = <i>Lotella rhacinus</i>. <i>ibid.</i> 210  in report from Cape Maria van Diemen, where the terms `blue-fish' and `rock-cod' (<i>Parapercis</i>) are used together , i suspect that the former were specimens of <i>Physiculus rhacinus</i>, and this would extend the range a little.

Quote:  This is where the confusion starts. He records <i>Merluccius gayi</i> (Guichenot)-syn. for <i>Merlus gayi</i> (Guich.) and <i>Gadus australis</i> (Hutton) - as the `hake,' and makes no independent record for <i>Physiculus rhacinus</i>, but admits that the records of the two fishes were in a state of hopeless confusion, thus tacitly admitting that specimens of both were recorded under the same name.
