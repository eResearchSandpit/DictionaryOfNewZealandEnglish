Quote:  Besides these there were many species which tho they did not at all resemble any fish that i at least have before [7] seen, our seamen contrivd to give names to, so that hakes [fn1], breams [2], Cole fish [3] &c. were appellations familiar with us, and i must say that those who bear these names in England need not be ashamed of their nam[e]sakes in this countrey. [ed. fn] 1. Probably Rock Cod <i>Lotella rhacinus</i> (Forster). 2. Snapper and Tarakihi. 3. These were Blue Cod, <i>Parapercis colias. </i>
