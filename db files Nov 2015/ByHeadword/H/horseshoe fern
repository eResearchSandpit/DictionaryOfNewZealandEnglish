Quote:  The root grows with irregular-shaped scales, somewhat like a horseshoe, and that is why it is also known as horseshoe fern. Early settlers variously described it as "very indifferently flavoured potato" and "sweet and mealy".

Quote:  <i>para</i>, a large fern (Marattia fraxinea), horse-shoe fern, from the shape of the tuber; also paraeka, since para was also the name given to the tubers of two orchids, Gastrodia Cunninghamii and Orthoceras strictum; but if there is no distinguishing suffix para is understood to mean the fern-tuber, as in the place-name Kaipara, so called because the well-known ihenga there enjoyed his first meal of that tuber.
