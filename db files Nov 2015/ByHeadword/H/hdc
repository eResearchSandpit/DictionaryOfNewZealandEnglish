Quote:  Cull proposes all claims come in the first instance to the office of the health and disability commissioner. The main investigation of complaints would occur there so the HDC would in effect act as gatekeeper for access to other avenues, such as ACC and the Medical Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal... Neither ACC nor the MPDT have this central purpose.
