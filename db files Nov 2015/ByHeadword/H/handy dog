Quote:  Sheep dog.- Dog to work sheep; collie (q.v.). S.ds. run naturally either to bring sheep towards you or to drive them away; and when a puppy shows his preference he is broken in for that work.

The dogs that bring sheep are called heading ds. (q.v.) and most of these can be taught to lead (q.v.) if desired. Dogs which take to driving sheep away are broken in to huntaway and are called htwys (q.v.). Some  dogs will both hd. and htwy and are called handy ds. They are not generally high-class heading dogs but very useful about hand and sometimes very useful mustering dogs. Some men have a special  slewing d., but a well-trained, hdg. dog or htwy. will usually

slew (q.v.). (C.)

Quote:  So the musterer of to-day, with his pack of five or six dogs, began to take shape. One or two of the border type - `heading dogs' as they're called now and three or four huntaways and `handy' dogs. <i>ibid.</i> 46 . . .Wait, the most wonderful dog i ever saw, a true `handy' dog. He would bring sheep out of any place where dog or sheep could go, and all his master ever said to him was `Here Wait! Here Wait!'; the rest was left to his own judgment and initiative and the sheep would be got.
