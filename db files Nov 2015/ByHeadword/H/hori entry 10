Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:a Maori [Maori Hori[o-macron], alteration of George]. it was often used as a stage-Maori name, or as a general term of reference or address to an un-named Maori. Unlike Hongi, it was not at first so objectivable as used by English speakers (but cf the 1933 quotation). it is used by Maoris among themselves humorously or sardonically;  cf George, hongi @n.  (From Maori rendering of English George, formerly fairly common as a name among Maoris, esp. during reigns of Kings George iii-Vi; cf.)  1a. a  particular Maori named Hori

Quote:  TVNZ said "Poms" was a term used affectionately by Kiwis and Australians, and it rejected the complainants' view that the word was comparable to terms such as "Chinks",  "Wogs", or "Horis". it agreed expressions such as "Pommy bastards" and "whingeing Poms" were terms of abuse. Authority chairman Sam Maling noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's ruling that the words "Pom" and "Pommy" were unlikely to offend of insult.

Quote:  During the war, as Kiwi soldiers slogged through North Africa and italy, the services newspaper wrote stories about "horis" - Maori soldiers. One of them, future race relations conciliator Harry Dansey, protested, and asked them not to use the word because it was derogatory. Only joking, they said.
