Quote:  (Bob Edwards, bushman) He [the swagger] said to me, `Well, i'm going through to the coast, and if you like you can roll up your bluey and come along with me.' ... i had a light bedroll, and it was good weather at the time, so i was down to what swaggies call a `heatwave knot' - down to a very light bedroll.
