Quote:  The huia is a black bird about as large as a thrush, with long thin legs and a slender semi-circular beak, which he uses in seeking in holes in trees for the insects on which he feeds. in the tail are four long black feathers tipt with white. These feathers are much valued by the natives as ornaments for the hair on great occasions ....
