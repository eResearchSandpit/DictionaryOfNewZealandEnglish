Quote:  The boys learnt a form of wrestling called `Collar and elbow' brought by miners from Lancashire. A Cumberland form of that sport was not so popular. in `Collar and elbow' the opponents clutched one another in strange `holts' - a right hand grasped an opponent's left  shoulder, the other hand grabbed his adversary's right elbow.
