Quote:  Rising to No. 2 level, a barren block of glassy quartz comes in, and the seamy gold-bearing quartz is pushed over to the two walls, and divided by clay partings from the barren centre block, which corresponds practically to a `horse' of country rock....  [The blocks] are frequently split by `horses' and the stone is generally mottled and seamy.
