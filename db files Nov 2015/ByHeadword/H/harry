Quote:  Bernard Gadd's <i>Oracle Bones</i> begins with the seven-part poem "Harry in the Rest Home". Denis Glover's Harry is a virtual icon of kiwi folklore. He once followed his "wild thoughts / Away over the hill, Where there is only the world / and the world's ill" (Glover's "Once the Days", 1951).
