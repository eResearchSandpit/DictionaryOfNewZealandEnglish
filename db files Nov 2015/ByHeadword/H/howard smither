Quote:  if a vessel sails at any time in the evening and to avoid payment of overtime to personnel who would have an excess of eight hours if they worked all day and their watch in the evening, they are given the afternoon off and report back on board just prior to sailing. Such time off is called `a Howard Smither'. One of the first companies to bring this in was one Howard Smith and Co. of Australia, a firm seafarer noted for means to save money at the so-called expense of the [hand].
