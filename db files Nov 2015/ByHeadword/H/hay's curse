Quote:  Hay's curse: A species of oxalis. i heard this in 1933 from T.L. Lancaster who was head of the Departtment of Botany Auckland University College. Hay's Nurseries were well known and old established nurseries in Auckland, still going then, but i believe since closed down. i am not certain of the particular species but the plants have pinkish flowers and produce large numbers of tubers and of corms, by which it spreads and which are almost impossible to get rid of! i understand that Hay introduced the plant into N.Z. it is the only time i have heard the name used, and imagine that it was then obsolescent.
