Quote:  ... to say nothing of Korimako and Pitoitoi ..., we never saw or heard the notes of either the Piopio, the Tieke, or the Hihi, all of which birds were at one time more numerous even than

the Huia. The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

Quote:  The last record of hihi on the mainland was from the 1880s, somewhere near Tararua. The species was thought to have gone the way of the huia, until a decent-sized population was found on Little Barrier island, which is where 95 per cent of hihi still live.
