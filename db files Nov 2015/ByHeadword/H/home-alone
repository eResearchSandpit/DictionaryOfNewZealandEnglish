Quote:  Hollywood ensured the words Home Alone were something to chuckle about. A 10-year-old's mischievous romps while left to his own devices were laughed at by millions. However, in New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes.... The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family.
