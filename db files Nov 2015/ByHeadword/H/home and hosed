Notes: Alistair Paterson, 34B Methuen Rd, Avondale (Fax.(09)8282209 says used in 1940's at the Aurora Sailing Club, Nelson, to describe a boat that's finished a race (usually successfully) and has been hauled from the water onto the hard and hosed down. It's my recollection (DEH) that the same phrase was used then also by racing commentators and it was transferred to the winner of any competitive event. Partridge ("A Dictionary of Catch Phrases") discusses "home and hosed" as an Aus. variant of "home and dried on the pig's back." He also says: "The predominantly UK and Anglo-Irish elab. is 'home and dried with the blanket on,' which 'stems from horse-racing, but . . . is used for any mission accomplished' (Skehan, 1977)."
