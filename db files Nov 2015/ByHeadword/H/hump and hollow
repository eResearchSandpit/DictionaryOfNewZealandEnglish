Quote:  One way in which it [the development programme] will do this is to 'hump and hollow' some of the pakihi soils and to 'flip' pasture. Humping and hollowing creates contoured surfaces to promote drainage. The plan at this stage is to turn all those properties that are able to be flipped or humped and hollowed into dairying.
