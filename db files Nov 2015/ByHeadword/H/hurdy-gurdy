Quote:  The machine age on the gumfield appears to have been heralded as early as 1915 when an ingenious digger, whose name has unfortunately been forgotten, introduced what came to be known as the `hurdy-gurdy' or `gurdy.' ... [83] in its simplest form it was a tub, or a section of a small galvanised iron tank, the bottom perforated with small holes. in the centre stood a strong, revolving, upright shaft, to the lower part of which was attached a wooden paddle, extending on both sides of the shaft, almost to the sides of the tank. The top of the revolving shaft was fitted with a horizontal handle, enabling the paddle to be swung to and fro in a half-circle. This simple machine was usually operated by two men; a supply of gum-bearing dirt having been put into the tank, buckets of water were thrown in by one man while the other vigorously turned the shaft handle this way and that, stirring up the soil while the muddy water flowed out through the perforations.
