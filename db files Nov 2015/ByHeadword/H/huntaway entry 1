Quote:  Huntaway. in both huntaway classes three sheep are set loose at the foot of the hill. While the shepherd remains at the bottom, his dog, working and barking to command, hunts the sheep upwards on a defined line away from his master. in the zig-zag hunt, the sheep are directed through three sets of flags 1 chain apart and spaced equally up the hill on a zig-zag course of approximately 440 yards. The course for the straight hunt is about the same length, from the foot of the hill up to and through a set of flags 1 chain apart.
