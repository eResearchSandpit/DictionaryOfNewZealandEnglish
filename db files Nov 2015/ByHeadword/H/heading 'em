Quote:  The Law defines the classic game of `two-up' as a gamble punishable by a magistrate, but that does not stop men from including in the pastime and losing their hard-earned gonce. There are a few `schools' in Christchurch, and a good deal of money changes hands occasionally. `Heading 'em' as it is called, is carried on in a certain licensed billiard saloon, and the patrons include some pretty hot individuals who are known to copperdom.

Quote:  This is how the toiling and moiling son of the soil, the chap who wears bowyangs and wields a pick, and swears and sweats in so doing, particularly when in camp, loves to while away an idle and sometimes expensive hour in `heading 'em',. . .
