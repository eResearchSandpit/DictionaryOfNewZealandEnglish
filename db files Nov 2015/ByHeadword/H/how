Quote:  Shell after shell burst round our ears as we clambered down. `Whiz-bangs' give no chance of escape. The first thing is the `whiz', and if it is coming straight there is no chance to escape the `bang'. it is different with the `how.', for ... a soldier can tell by the note of its flight if the shell is coming near or not.
