Quote:  i attended the making of a hunters' pie. First i laid the [newly taken] skin on the ground, cutting up the meat into small pieces, not forgetting the kidney and a small piece of bacon ... salted and added a little water and then folded carefully. When the fire was well burnt down i scraped the sticks and embers away, plaining the pie with the folded side on top.
