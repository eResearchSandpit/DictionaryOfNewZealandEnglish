But i see to-day in `The Press' (June 27, 1933)  the editor speaks of a decrease of so many h. of sheep disclosed by this year's sheep return. (C.)

Hence  heading dog, one whose work this is. if he does it neatly he makes a good h See also sheep dog. 3. The owner would say, `i can head with him'.(C; [1874 Kennaway Crusts],p. 45)
