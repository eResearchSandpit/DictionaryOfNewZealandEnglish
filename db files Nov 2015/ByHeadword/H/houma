Quote:  <i>S. tetraptera</i>, Aiton, var. <i>microphylla</i>, Jacq. ... The `Kowhai' of the North island Maori; the `Kowai' of settlers, - or as the word is variously corrupted and spelt by them, - `Goai' or `Ghoai,' `Goa' or `Ghoa.' According to Hector, the type is known to Otago Maoris as `Houma;' while the term `Kowhai' is applied to var. <i> grandiflora</i> in common with its other varieties. Var. <i>microphylla</i> is also sometimes designated by the colonists the Native `Laburnum' or `Mimosa,' from the similarity of its foliage, in the arboreous condition, to that of these familiar ... European trees.
