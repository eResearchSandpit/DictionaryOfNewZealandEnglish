Quote:  SNiGGiNG-TRACKS. ... Good straight tracks make hauling easy. A few pieces of corduroy placed across the track are a great help ... A good snigger will see that a log is not jammed before signalling `Right ahead' to the hauler, and will use his snigging-shoe ... to lift the log out of bad places.

Quote:  With the cost of a hauler running close to a millon dollars, and much of the other heavy gear costing around a quarter of that per machine, it is almost impossible for a younger logger to set up on his own [108] without this sort of support.
