Notes: Health camps in the US were for tuberculosis; camps for children were set up in Britain but run in entirely different from those in New Zealand. The first to be held in NZ catered for 55 children at Turakina where children sleep in tents, eat meals out of doors, practised daylight saving, and which was run on military lines, the children acting as corporals, sergenats, buglers, etc. New Zealand health camps focussed on prevention rather than cure.

Quote:  With a background like this, Banks was a candidate for the health camps. Set up after World War One, they were originally intended for malnourished and tubercular children. After World  War Two they specialised in children who were nervous, solitary and emotionally troubled... We would never admit to the other kids that we were going to a health camp, because, supposedly, any kid who went to health camps was diseased.
