Quote:  At the principal villages in that rugged region ...  the Hauhau poles, the sacred niu, were set up and round them marched the half-crazed people ... chanting their newly learned hymns ... the prayers of the  `Kororia,' Maorified English phrases and scraps of English and Roman Catholic church services.
