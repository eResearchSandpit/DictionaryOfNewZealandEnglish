Quote:  Extinct birds ... Laughing Owl <i>Sceloglaux albifacies</i> (GRAY, 1844) OTHER NAMES:

Whekau, hakoke (North island),rock owl. The `doleful shrieks' of the laughing owl, which varied seasonally, were heard incessantly on rainy nights. Apparently it was easily kept in captivity, and reports say that it cooeyed in the evening, yelped like a young dog and mewed and chuckled. ... The most recent record of sighting was at Manapouri in 1950 ...
