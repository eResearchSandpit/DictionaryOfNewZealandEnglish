Quote:  Many legends are associated with the mythical bird "hokioi"... in the South and in some parts of the North island it is identical, apparently, with the "hakuwai" which has seven joints in its wing, lives in the sky, and presages trouble... "its cry was Hokioi! Hokioi! Hu!" The last word represented the whizzing sound made by the bird in flight.
