Quote:  Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement.  Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.

Quote:  The term `hack' as understood in this country is not at all to be conflicted with the same term as applied elsewhere to horse racing under that category. A hack in New Zealand is a horse that has not won a certain amount of moneys [sic], and so it is quite possible for the Derby favorite of the year, or the New Zealand Cup favorite to be a hack.
