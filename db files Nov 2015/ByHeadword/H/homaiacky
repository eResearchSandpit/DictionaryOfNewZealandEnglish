Quote:  Of the Help-He games, Kick the Tin, is the most widely known. A tin is placed in the centre of a circle. One He is in charge of the tin. He can only tag the other players when his tin is in the centre of the circle. Any players he catches must stay in the circle. Any non-caught player can help and free the other caught players by running through the circle and kicking the tin out of it. Other names for this game are: Kick the Boot (Gisborne [18]90), Knock the Block or Homaiacky (Nelson [18]95), Kick the football or Piacky (Mangatainoka).

Quote:  in a few tagging games the players joined hands with the He when they were caught and helped him catch the other players. These games were known as  The Bellahonie (E-21) (Wellington, 1910), Kick Post One (Hampden, Otago, 1880), and Ballyhooley (Wellington, 1920). More popular were those games in which the players helped one another to fight the He, and of these the most widespread was the game known as  Kick the Tin (e-3), Kick the Boot, Kick the Block, or Homiacky.  in this game the He was put on guard of a jam tin placed inside a small circle marked on the ground. [Other players hid: those He could see he named and tapped the tin three times and `captured': other hiders waited till they had chance to kick tin out of circle: then all were free again.]
