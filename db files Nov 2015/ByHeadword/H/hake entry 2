Quote:  There is much confusion in the common names applied to New Zealand fishes, and the application of the name `Hake' to several distinct species of our fishes, is a good example of that confusion. in Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very  different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae. </i>

<i>ibid.</i> 154 SOUTHERN KiNGFiSH <i>Rexea solandri</i> (Cuv. & Val.) ... The Southern Kingfish is closely related to the Barracouta, and is known in the North island as the `hake' but this name is more accurately applied to a very different fish, <i>Merlangius australis</i>, which belongs to the true Cod family. <i>ibid.</i> 155 [Southern Kingfish, <i>Rexea Solandri</i>] is found also in southern Australian waters. in Sydney it is sold as `hake'. it is also known as `Hake' in Auckland and sometimes sold as `lemon-fish'. <i>ibid.</i> 170 Southern Kingfish Rexea solandri Hake

Quote:  HAKE: See Southern Kingfish <i>ibid.</i> 200 SOUTHERN KiNGFiSH <i>Jordanidia solandri</i>. This is the King Barracouta of Australia and the so-called Hake of more southern New Zealand waters. <i>ibid.</i> 201 [The Southern Kingfish is] Called Hake in southern fish shops but bears no resemblance to the traditional English Hake which is far less oily. Tasmanian kingfish,  barraconda and `tikati' (Maori) are other names. <i>ibid.</i> 141 Another so-called Kingfish occurs in southern New Zealand  waters but this is no relative of <i>Seriola Grandis</i>. He is the Silver Kingfish, who is sometimes called Hake and known in Australia as Gemfish.

Quote:  Gemfish <i>Rexea solandri</i> ... Also occurs off southern Australia, as well as Japan. New Zealand names include silver or southern kingfish and hake (which is now easily confused with the true hake). The name gemfish, conveying family relationship as well as irridescence, is more appropriate.
