Quote:  At the war there were Froggy soldiers that always carried round little boxes - just little wee things less than the size of a matchbox. And inside there was a model of Christ on the cross - just a tiny thing. And over the top there was a word you could hardly read but it looked like H-E-N-R-i.  Well, Mr Anderson said, i could never work it out why they were called Henrys - that's what us diggers called them, little Henrys. D'you know, i've always meant to ask somebody why they were called that name.  And it was on the tip of Dave's tongue to explain, but he thought no. Because he'd have to explain why the i's weren't J's, and --[note 271:] ... His explanation of `little Henry' would have been based on i.N.R.i., Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, from Lat. iesus Nazarenus, Rex iudaeorum.
