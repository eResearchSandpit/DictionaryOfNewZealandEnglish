Quote:  Civilization is saved, for example, when instead of trying to torture a classmate a child says, `Guess what happened to Bailey?' `What?' `This,' and the child pulls out the fold in a piece of paper on which Bailey has been drawn with his neck in a noose, When the fold is pulled out his neck suddenly appears as stretched several inches in length - a nice little game known as Hanging Bailey.
