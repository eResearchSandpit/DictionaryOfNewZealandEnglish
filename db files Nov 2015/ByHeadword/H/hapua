Quote:  From the spot where Huruhuru left us our path lay along a pebble ridge, with the sea on one side, and the lake Waihao on the other. This `hapua,' as all similar pieces of water are called, has no outlet to the sea except at times of floods, when one is made by the bank of pebbles breaking down at its weakest point: at other times its water oozes through the pebbles and sand. After leaving Waihao, which was nearly three miles long, we passed several small `hapua' similar to it.

<i>ibid.</i> 307 HAPUA, a shallow lake, the termination of a river, separated from the sea by a bank of sand or shingles. Syn. hopua.

Quote:  ... the material of which it was constructed being only cabbage trees, korari (flax stalks), and raupo; both of the latter grew plentifully round the Lagoon, or hapua, as the Maoris called it,

which then contained nice clear water ...

Quote:  Waitarakao, a large `hapua' or lagoon or sheet of water. <i>ibid/.</i> 64 Koareare is the edible part of the root of the raupo, and was got in the hapua (lagoons) and re (swamps). The name runs off the tongue glibly when given its southern pronunciation, `ko-a-ray-a-ray'.
