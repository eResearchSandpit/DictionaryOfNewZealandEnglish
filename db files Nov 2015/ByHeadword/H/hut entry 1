Quote:  You are fairly entitled to something better than a warre[e-acute], say a two-roomed hut for yourself ... and a large, strong wata, or store raised on posts to keep your provisions safe from rats. ... slabs plastered with clay are also used for walls ... One of these huts must serve you for your first year's wool-shed, with the help of a few hurdles in front.

Quote:  He [the pioneer pastoralist] has built a domicile of some sort, be it of canvas, calico, bagging, sticks, ferntrees, grass, slabs, mud, clay, stone, or wattle and daub. He may call it various names according to its materials, but three names would not enter his head - i.e., crib, back, or shack. He may call it a cabin, a shanty, a cottage, a warrie [whare], but probably he would use the commonest term of all - hut.

Quote:  There is a danger of all writers about the old days using modern terms which were not used in the period they were writing about, and i have always tried to steer clear of this pit. Young writers are particularly prone to go astray in this matter, and we see talk of pioneer shacks in Otago, using a modern Canadian word, where an Otago pioneer would have said hut or warrie.

Quote:  Hut. House where the station hands or shearers live. Some call it a whare. Until the 1930s and

40s the men usually ate, cooked and slept in a one-roomed hut with a fireplace at one end and bunks in tiers around the walls. Often there were no facilities for washing other than the creek. Today most huts are quite comfortable, with separate rooms for eating and sleeping, showers and toilets.
