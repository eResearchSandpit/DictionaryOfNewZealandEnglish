Quote:  The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Quote:  Homestead. in the old days the owner's residence, but only if it was some distance from the rest of the station buildings (see big house). when the Goverment began cutting up the runs in the 'nineties, they or their surveyors adopted the word to signify what had been formerly called the station, and the new settlers followed them, so that the new sense of the word is now widely used. Butler and Sir F. Weld also use it in the modern sense, but in writing for Englishmen. (C.R.)
