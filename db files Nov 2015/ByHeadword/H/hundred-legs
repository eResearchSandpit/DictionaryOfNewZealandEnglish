Quote:  These [Myriapoda] are mostly of the harmless `thousand-legged' species, whose only protection appears to be to curl themselves into a spiral and emit an evil-smelling fluid; but one occasionally gets one of the `hundred-legs,' or `Meggy-monny-legs,' who, with his well-armed, fierce appearance, has gained the reputation of being poisonous.
