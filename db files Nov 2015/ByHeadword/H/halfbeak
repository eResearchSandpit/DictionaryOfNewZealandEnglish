Quote:  GAR FiSH (<i>Hemiramphus intermedius</i>). ... [34] This name is  applied both to the skipper (<i>Scombresox Forsteri</i>) and to the ihi or half-beak, which are allied fishes representing those of the same names in the British seas. The representatives of the former genus, however, though common in England, appear to be rare in these seas, while the half-beak, which is of rare occurrence in the British seas, is common all round New Zealand, and is the ordinary gar-fish that is so highly appreciated, especially in Auckland and Dunedin.
