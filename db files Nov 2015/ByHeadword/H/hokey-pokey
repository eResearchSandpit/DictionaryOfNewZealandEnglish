Quote:  That dessert is truly a bit of New Zealand (or Australia, depending on the native) as is the hokey pokey ice cream, which the young investment banker seated beside me.. declares is just about the best dessert he has ever eaten... i daren't tell him that hokey pokey ice cream is found in every dairy in every village in New Zealand.
