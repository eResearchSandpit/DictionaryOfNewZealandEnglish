Quote:   [Hdg] Media react to `heckler's veto'/  Are the views and `messages' of these [special interest pressure groups] being given undue prominence too often? Are they tending to beat into the ground opposing views, equally or more valid but less well organised? Are they imposing, in fact, a form of censorship. ...  The term `heckler's veto' was coined by the incoming president of the Auckland Council for Civil Liberties in September. He was publicly voicing concern over the action of police in seizing anti-Black pamphlets from the pro-white Nationalist Workers' Party.
