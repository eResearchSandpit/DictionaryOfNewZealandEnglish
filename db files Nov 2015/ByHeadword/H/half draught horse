Quote:  in those days (1883), there was a ferryman, named Jack Heney, whose job it was to convoy the coaches across the Orari and Rangitata rivers; thinking i would be frightened, he ranged alongside the coach, on a big half draught horse, grabbed me by the collar and carried me back to the south bank.
Notes:  [f. c1869]
