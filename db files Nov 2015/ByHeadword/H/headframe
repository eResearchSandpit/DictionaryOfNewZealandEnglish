Quote:  Headframe: The poppet-head erected above a shaft was also called a headframe. it had to be very strong to withstand the shock and weight of two cages plus the weight of over 1000 ft of heavy wire-rope, with a wide margin of safety, and high enough to allow double-deck cages to be used if necessary and to have at least 10 ft clearance above the detaching hook to the detaching-ring. Most of the headframes were of steel but Nos 5 and 6 were of kauri timber. The back stays were placed midway in the angle between the winding-rope and the line of the shaft.
