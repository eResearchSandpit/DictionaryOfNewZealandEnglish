Quote:  The word Home on most New Zealanders' lips is no more than a synonym for the United Kingdom; it does not mean `dear old England', or `my beloved birthplace,' or `my real country'; it does not even mean what the United Kingdom means to all irish irishmen. it simply means the

United Kingdom, and is used without emotion, as a word that has been handed down from father to son, and mother to daughter. it is part of the real New Zealand language, a genuine piece of Antipodean slang. And, like all slang, it has its significance.
