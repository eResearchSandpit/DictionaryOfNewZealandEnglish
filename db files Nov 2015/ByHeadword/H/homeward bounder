Quote:  it was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.  <i>ibid.</i> 275 The richest claim was always a `homeward-bounder'. A Nelson digger recalled how at work his mates talked of `trips to Europe, going back for a week, and astonishing the Natives generally'. <i>ibid.</i> 329 J. F. Byrne & Co. showed off their wares by the light of six kerosene chandeliers and advertised, THE REAL HOMEWARD BOUNDER!/An ounce to the Dish can be Saved/ BY BUYiNG YOUR/CLOTHiNG AND BOOTS AT THE CORiNTHiAN HALL/ NEW RUSH NEW RUSH /Peg out your claims at the Corinthian Hall if you want to strike a good lead/Dead on the gutter/ BUY YOUR CLOTHiNG AND BOOTS AN THE CORiNTHiAN HALL/
