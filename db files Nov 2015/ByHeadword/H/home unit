Quote:  Review NZPOD Town house is in, and uneasily acceptable as a `residence in town esp. of person with house in the country' although `in the country' could be better phrased; but `house in (esp. terraced) group in town' is not apt, and increasingly the style for this type of dwelling is townhouse. That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other. There is as well a question of nuance to be noticed. A townhouse is emphatically upmarket from a home unit.
