Quote:  i had a word with Manawatu hill country farmer Darrell Shellard, after he was quoted saying there was no use howlibagging about flood damage; you just had to get on with cleaning up the mess. ... Howlibagging is a great word, presumably a mixture of howling and bagging (criticising), but Darrell says he has no idea where it came from.
