Quote:  After the All Blacks had beaten Wales in the first match of their grand slam, i was startled to find a sports writer lambasting commentator Murray Mexted for applying the word "heady" to rugby, when "heady", in his view, only meant things like "intoxicating" etc.  News to me.  Phrases like "He plays a heady game" or He's a heady player" have been in New Zealand sporting vocabulary all my life, meaning "thinking, intelligent, or analytical".

Quote:  Mex Files: "He's always been a heady player." - Murray Mexted may have been trying to describe Leon McDonald as "intoxicating, impetuous, or overbearing".  Or he might simply have got the wrong word.
