Quote:  Baloo baloo balight,/ All on a Saturday night,/ Put your right hand in,/ Put your right hand out,/ Shake it a little a little/ And turn right about./  This curious song had a revival in another form as the boisterous dance-hall craze of World War ii, the hoki toki, or as many South islanders called it, the hokey pokey.
