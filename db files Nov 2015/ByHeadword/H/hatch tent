Quote:  `Right, up we go and put the tent on. The rain's gathering a bit of weight.' A hatch tent consists of a large, light tarpaulin which is lashed down round the hatch coaming while its centre is held up by a wire strung fore-and-aft across the hold. it provides effective temporary cover for an open hold, saving the time and labour required to replace the more cumbersome permanent hatch covers.
