Quote:  The other garments of skins are the <i>huru huru</i>, and the <i>parawai</i>; the former is frequently worn, especially during the cold season, by the people of Cook's Straits and the districts south of Taupo [and is made of dog's skins] ... The other dress, called <i>parawai</i>, is exceedingly scarce; it comes from the Southern island, and is made of strips of dog's fur, arranged indiscriminately all over a very large mat of the finest flax.
