Quote:  He was knocked kite high, however, when the owner of the pocket-book, a man of means, sent along 2s 6d for the recovery of his pocket-book. He might have known that the reward would have gone to charity in any case, but half a dollar! Mother Mary Aubert is getting the half-caser, anyhow, and bad cess to him that it wasn't a guinea.

The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and  two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only  two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.
