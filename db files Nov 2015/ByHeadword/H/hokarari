Quote:  The Ling was known to the Maoris as Hokarari. Some years ago ago large catches were made in Cloudy Bay, and were placed on the Wellington market as `Cloudy Bay Cod'. The scientific name <i>Genypterus blacodes</i>, freely translated, means `a flabby fish, with a fin on the chin.' The New Zealand Ling is also found in Australia where it is known as the `Rockling.'
