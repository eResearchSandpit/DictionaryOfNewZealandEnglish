Quote:  Labour Hutt south MP Trevor Mallard said Hibs was "basically built to integrate".   "Hibs has never been what i  would regard as a special-character school and that is relatively simple: it was set up to be an elite school and the Christian bit of it, compared to other integrated schools, is very light."
