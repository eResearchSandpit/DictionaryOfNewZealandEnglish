Also known as `sprat', though this term also covers the young of several species including anchovy, yelloweye mullet and several other small fish. There are only two, `true' herrings in our waters. <i>ibid.</i>164 The Yellow-Eye has a much narrower head than the Grey and is the ubiquitous, but misnamed `sprat' or `herring' of our wharves.
