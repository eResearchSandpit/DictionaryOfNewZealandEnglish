Quote:  The other night i overheard someone referring disparagingly to humans as "herdal" creatures.  i pricked up my ears, to check i hadn't heard a misplaced description of humans as "herbal" creatures because we eat so much stuff classified as herbal. But no, "herdal" was the word, intended to specify our inclination to follow the herd instinct instead of thinking for ourselves.
