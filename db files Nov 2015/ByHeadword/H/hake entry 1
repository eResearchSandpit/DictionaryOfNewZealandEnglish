Quote:  The latter is caught plentifully by line and trawl, but is not highly regarded as a food fish, while its close relative the Hake or Whiting (<i>Merluccius gayi</i> ), is much less common but is not more eagerly sought after on that account.

Quote:  HAKE (a) Scientific name: <i>Merluccius australis</i>. (b) Suggested commercial name[s]: Hake. (c) Other common names: Whiting; English Hake. (d) Principal localities where taken: Taken only rarely nowdays off Wellington in deep water; ... Whatever the position was years ago it is a fact that this fish is rare today. The position is further complicated by the almost indiscriminate use of the name hake, by fishermen, [for] other species of fish. ... The name Hake shold not be applied to either Southern kingfish or the Whiptail although there can be little, if any, objection to the commercial name of Blue Hake for the latter species.
