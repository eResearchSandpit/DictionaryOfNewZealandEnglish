Quote:  in the first decades of this century, when i was a boy in Waimea, not a school tea party (an all-district event) went by without playing Bingo and/or Drop the Handkerchief. These were also the usual games at `hop-sprees' and end-of-picking payouts where there was ginger-pop or better. [Waimea West: 1910]
