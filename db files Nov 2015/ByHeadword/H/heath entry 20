Quote:  Fortunately there were many shrubs of <i>Dracophyllum longifolium. </i> growing in this locality, which even in their green state burn freely, and which enable the traveller in those regions, so much exposed to rain, to light a fire with comparative ease. This plant has needle-shaped leaves, generally of a brownsh tint,and small bell-shaped white flowers. it [115] is generally called a native heath by the Europeans. As some of the bushes grow to a height of ten feet with thick branches, it offers wood enough to keep up a cheerful fire.
