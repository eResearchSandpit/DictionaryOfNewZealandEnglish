Quote:  Hokonui sheep are out of the same hills [as Hokonui whisky] and although not illegal, are certainly a curiosity. A fairly original form of Merino, they've run wild for well over a century and have developed, or reverted to, quite a few distinct characteristics. There's the varying shades of black, brown and grey with a wee dash of white on the forehead and a white tip on the tail...'They're just different,' he says. 'Things like positioning of bones and teeth, everything from the traditional farm animal breeding world, you can forget about when it comes to Hokonuis. They're as tough as old boots and interesting in their grazing habits. They prefer rough feed and will eat heads and thistles before they touch the clover.'..interested though he is, there's no way Peter will reduce the Coopworth flock in concession to the Hokonuis.

Quote:  The first record of the feral Hokonuis was in 1863, a flock of about 200 animals, so they have had 150 years to adapt. The Hokonuis' ancestors are believed to be smooth-skinned Saxony Merinos .. When and how Hokonuis came to be here is unlikely to be proven.
