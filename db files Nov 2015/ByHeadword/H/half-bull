The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull,  half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and  two-and-a-buck. in the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.
