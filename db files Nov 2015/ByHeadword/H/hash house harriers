Quote:  Despite its name, Wellington Hash House Harriers has nothing to do with the drug. it bills itself as a drinking club with a running problem... Hash House Harriers was started in Malaysia in 1938 by a handful of Britons. "They decided to have a hare and hound-type chase on a Monday evening."...

The name Hash House came about because it was what these Britons called the boarding house where they lived.
