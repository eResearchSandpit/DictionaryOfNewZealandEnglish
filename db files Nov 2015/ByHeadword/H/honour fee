Quote:  One of the most initially shocking [fees] is the honour fee introduced by ANZ in June. The way it works, on certain accounts, is that for every day the account is improperly overdrawn - i.e. if you haven't previously arranged an overdraft facility - the first two transactions that day each attract a $15 penalty. ... "Fundamentally, " Shaw points out, "there's no reason for a customer to incur an honour fee. An overdraft facility costs you less a year [$28] than two honour fees."
