Quote:  He was what is termed in mining phraseology, a `hatter', - meaning one who works by himself. ... Alone and unaided he scooped the wash-dirt into his cradle, which he vigorously rocked with his left hand, whilst with the right he ladled water from the river into the `hopper' or seive [sic]. ... He cast aside the `dipper', and hastened towards the eddy.

Quote:  Hatter: Whatever the origin of the phrase, `as mad as a hatter' can have been, i have often unsuccessfully endeavoured to discover. But doubtless it is from this phrase that the name of hatter has come to be applied in mining parlance, to one who works alone or without a mate. There are always a few of these unsocial miners about every digging, and their solitariness arises from every imaginable cause. Frequently they are misanthropes, sometimes placid contented creatures, who, so long as they can make a living by `fossicking' about, are happy. / [139]. My host was a hatter and he always kept a spare stretcher for any chance passer-by.

Quote:  HATTER: a solitary, a digger who works alone. The derivation of this New Zealand expression is obscure. Archdeacon Harper described the hatters as `men who live and work by themselves, often old sailors and much travelled men, content with the solitude of well-kept huts, a few books, hard work, their dog as companion, perhaps some poultry, and a weekly visit on Saturdays to the townships to sell their gold and see friends. Whence the term `hatter' i have never discovered; maybe because such solitaries are regarded as `mad as a hatter'. Another possibility is suggested by the remark that the hatter `kept his whole world under his hat'.
