Quote:  A Tour in Australia and New Zealand 55 Concentration of grazing carries with it other important effects - the benefits of what Bruce Levy has so appropriately termed 'hoof cultivation.' in New Zealand the soil dries so rapidly after rain that the 'hoof' seldom does harm and most frequently only does good - provided of course that a period of rest follows a period of excessive 'cultivation.' The combined application of 'hoof cultivation' and judicious feeding out is a method definitely employed for grass land improvement in New Zealand.
