Quote:  ROCK COD or SOUTHERN HAKE <i>Lotella rhacinus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) Up to 1891 this fish was universally known to scientists and fishermen  as Hake, then for some unknown reason E. R. Waite (<i>Records of the Canterbury Museum</i>, Vol. 1, No. 3) transferred the name Hake to <i>Merluccius gayi</i>, with Whiting as a second alternative common name. ... The most common name among Otago fishermen was Rock Cod, because this fish favours a rocky habitat.

Quote:  The Cloudy Bay cod (<i>Lotella rhacinus</i>), also known as rock cod and southern hake, is rather more brown and lacks the dark blotch by the pectoral fin. <i>ibid.</i> 1/898 HAKE is a name applied to several quite different marine fish in  different parts of the country. The whiting or haddock, <i>Merluccius  australis</i>, is a true hake, very similar to the North Sea species; it is, actually, often called English hake. it occurs in fairly deep  water south of Cook Strait. The southern kingfish, <i>Jordanidia  solandri</i>, is also known as hake: it is closely related and similar to the barracouta, and found throughout New Zealand. The Cloudy Bay cod, <i>Lotella rhacinus</i>, is sometimes known as southern hake.(see also Kingfish.)
