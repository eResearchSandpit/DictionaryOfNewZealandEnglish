Quote:  The Home Guard has atrtracted little attention from historians... There was nothing glamorous about the Home Guard... it was nearly a year after war was declared that the War Cabinet finally laid plans for the formation of a volunteer Home Guard, to comprise men who were too old or to young to serve overseas, or who were being kept at home in essential occupations... The urgency and seriousness of the war eventually forced Home Guard units to be set up in almost every settlement and town in the country... The Home Guard in New Zealand eventually numbered 12,000 in its ranks.
