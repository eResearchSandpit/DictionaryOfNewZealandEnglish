Quote:  On emerging from Pamaki [a's-acute], we ascended another plain of some miles in circumference, covered with fern and bush, above which the tupakihi [a-acute], or native elder-berry, occasionally shewed its bending stem, yielding to the weight of the fruit, which hung in purple clusters. ... The natives, on perceiving me make use of this berry, warned me not to

swallow any of the seeds, as the doing so would make me <i>ourangi</i>, drunk, or mad.
