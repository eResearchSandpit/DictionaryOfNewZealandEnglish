Quote:  The seed of the Heroic Gardens Festival took root back in 1995, when a group met to discuss the possibility of a gay garden festival.  They envisaged the event being part of the Hero festivities, with the proceeds going to Herne Bay House.  This was an Auckland City Mission residential service, offering quality care and support for those living with HiV and Aids.
