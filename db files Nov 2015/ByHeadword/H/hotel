Quote:  i might say with propriety that six eighths of all the European houses are nothing more than grogeries. Here are in capital letters over the door `Tap'. One in particular so-called Hotel, a man and his family the only occupants, over the door a large sign one third as large as the front, with bold letters `Victoria Hotel.' Her Majesty must feel proud to have her name in blazon letters embellishing a house, where all kinds of satanical devices are practiced with [sic] impunity.

Quote:  in London the swells in the park drive all round, But the diggers drive here with a pick underground;  And the props that they use, surely everyone knows  Ain't the same used in London for hanging up clothes.  The women use fans* there, the men use them here,  Though to cockneys that statement may sound very queer, And the fellows that frequently hang round hotels,  Out here are called loafers, at home are called swells.  -->[p 89 fn] * A fan is a machine for pumping air down the shafts.

Quote:  Drinking here is fostered by the appearance and number of the `hotels'. `Hotel' sounds more respectable than `public-house'. The bars are opener, more numerous and less clandestine-looking than at home.

Quote:  The town [Lyttelton] was hilly ..., and for so small a place there seemed no end of `Pubs', or Hotels as they are called here, at each corner of which stood groups of men, idling and gossipping - in fact, the male element prevailed greatly, and it was rather an ordeal for the `New Chum' to have to go through the ranks this way. <i>ibid.</i> 134 if this is agreed they will adjourn to the nearest inn, or hotels as these little match-boxes are called; ... When one friend meets another very often the greeting will [135] be, `Are you going to stand `shout'?' in other words, `Are you going to stand drink or `treat'?' if this is agreed to they will adjourn to the nearest inn, or hotels as these poor little match-boxes are called; and in fact there is a great deal of standing `shout' in the Colonies, both in public and in private.

Quote:  About the centre of the township, on the main street, two or three hotels, already mentioned, stood, with most of the other places of business scattered around in their vicinity. The hotels were at such a distance from each other as to allow the landlord of each to stand at his own door and watch with feelings of envy any unusual trend of customers seeking refreshment at the other. They were large, pretentious buildings of their class, with verandah and balcony to each, and were well-conducted inns, the accommodation afforded to travellers being all that could be expected - equal, indeed, to that of some of the best hotels in the larger centres.
