Quote:  Not having the needful to pay for tea, bed, and breakfast in Dannevirke, i called at Mr. Knight's station, where i got permission from the manager to sleep in the wool-shed, and got what is called amongst the brotherhood a `Hand out' that is, six biscuits, a bit of meat, and a billy-can full of tea.
