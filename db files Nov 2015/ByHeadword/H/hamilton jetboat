Quote:  A jet boat is a standard boat fitted with a car engine to drive a sophisticated pump or "jet unit". This draws water in through an intake in the bottom of the hull and forces it out at high pressure, jet-like, through a nozzle in the rear. Unlike a conventional boat, the jet boat has neither propellor or rudder. instead, it is pushed along, and steered, simply by the thrust of the jet stream
