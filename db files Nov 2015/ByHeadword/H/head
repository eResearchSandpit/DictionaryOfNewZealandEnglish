Quote:  i knew that in the Long Head event, when a dog had run up the hill and reached a position behind the mob, his owner had to stop him in order to constitute a proper "head", and he could not go on with the business of bringing the sheep down towards him in the "draw" until the judge gave him a wave to carry on.
