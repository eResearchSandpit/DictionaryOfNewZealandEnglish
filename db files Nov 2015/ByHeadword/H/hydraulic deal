Quote:  A HiGH COURT jury was told by Crown counsel Justin Smith in Wellington yesterday of a

hire purchase `hydraulic deal' - a transaction, in which a hire purchase agreement stated a deposit had been paid whereas, in fact, it had not. ... Mr Smith said that during the trial the jury would hear about what was known colloquially as a `hydraulic deal'. This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of

$10,000 by any hire purchaser.  in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000.  `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.'  Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit.
