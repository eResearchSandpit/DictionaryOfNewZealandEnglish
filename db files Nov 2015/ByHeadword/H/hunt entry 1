Quote:  Sheep - it is in their nature to be inconvenient - are invariably over or down or up there, and shepherds want them somewhere else. They must be hunted to that place, in dog trials off the flat and up the hill in the Straight Hunt. The ZigZag uses three sets of two poles to represent such obstacles and the dog must hunt the sheep left, then right, then left through them.
