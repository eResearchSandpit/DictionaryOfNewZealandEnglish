Quote:  Five minutes from time Petone were awarded a penalty under the M.S.P. posts but Mr Bailey changed his decision when a Petone forward honed in on a M.S.P. forward. [i'm sure this isn't an error. i've heard it lots of times and always connected it with `hone' = `sharpen', rather than `home'. (Jane Godfrey's note: 20 Jan. 1983).]
