Notes: Hoot, is first recorded as slang from Otago in 1864. This is reasonable. In the more Maori districts the use would still have primary Maori meanings and associations, while in Otago, where there were few Maoris, the transference to purely European idiom be could completed much earlier. This transference was probably helped by rhyme with  loot (cf the ? mistaken interpretation of 1845 Barnicoat Journal 163. `Our first endeavour was to get a native as a guide over the hills `How much the loot' of course was the answer to our enquiries.') though op. cit 190 `bargained for utu');  loot could have been an occasional joking word for money, although it is not attested in NZ until fairly recently but cf Partridge. Supp. Loot 3. `Scottish slang for money received on pay-day' Services: ca 1925;  anglicised as hoot, money, cash.

Quote:  `There are several specimens of bush slang transplanted from the Maori language. `Hoot' is a very frequent synonym for money or wage. i have heard a shearer at the Pastoralist Union office in Sydney when he sought to ascertain the scale of remuneration, enquire of the gilt-edged clerk behind the barrier, `What's the hoot, mate?' The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North island. The original  meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving a

solatium  in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.'
