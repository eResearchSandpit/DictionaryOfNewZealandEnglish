Quote:  A notice in the local Press brought me further examples from other eastern rivers - namely, the Ashley and Hurunui; and I was told that they [sc. torrentfish] were known as `shark bulllies', in allusion to the inferior position of the mouth, coupled with some resemblance to the gobies, commonly called `bullies'.
