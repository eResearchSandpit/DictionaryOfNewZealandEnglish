Quote:  While putting up a printing office [in Port Nicholson] I picked up two wanderers, who I engaged to saw ... I adopted them because they were shaved and clean. ... They appeared to me to contrast to great advantage [?with] the regular `beach comber'. I write the phrase large because I think it is [???new] to you. It is appropriate to the class. Its meaning I assume is evident. The `beach combing' class is large. The fellows are daring, dirty, requiring much excitement, accustomed to work on shore and on board, generally about the beach, and take what they find without any very strong sense of doing that which is improper.
