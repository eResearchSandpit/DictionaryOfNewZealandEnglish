Quote:  A very bitter cold wind which blows down the gorge of the Mawhera and afflicts the river front, railway station, and adjacent streets of Greymouth. The miners and drovers used the word in the 'sixties, and it is still in use. (C.[1890-1910])

Quote:  A very cold, slow-moving wind that comes down to Greymouth from the inland of a winter evening and then recedes the following day. It brings foggy conditions and is most unpleasant. I am unaware of its origin but locals inform me that it is nowhere as bad as some 20 years ago, their theory being that so much of the bush is cut out with the result that rain-saturated foliage is not exposed for fog-generating.
