Quote:  <i>battle</i> make pregnant, merely make love. Vince Boyle of Winton was researching a history of Mossburn when he came across a fellow recalling his wagoning days in 1914 in Northern Southland, and spoke of how he `battled a woman'. He was going to marry her, but a few days before the wedding she had a dentist remove her teeth and sent him the bill. They did not get married. Farmer and Henley describe a battler as one given up to debauchery, which leaves an outside chance that the wagoner merely seduced and failed to fertilise.
