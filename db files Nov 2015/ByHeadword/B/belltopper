Quote:  He had a good voice; he liked to sing in public, he liked to dance and attend pic-nics - to put on his `bell topper' and walk out of Church if he disapproved of anything said in the sermon - and he had a passion for inventing highly unpracticable things, like collapsible umbrellas or folding lamps. He had one saying with which he met all difficulties. `Depend upon it, it will all come right after the Maori war.'
