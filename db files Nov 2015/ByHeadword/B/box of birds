Quote:  `A BOX OF BIRDS'

Sir, - I am aware that idioms in any language are often difficult to analyse, but there is one phrase used in New Zealand which leaves me completely puzzled. It is the expression `a box of birds,' given in reply to the greeting `How are you?' and is evidently intended to mean a state of well-being. This appears to be so completely irrelevant that I would be pleased if any of your readers could elucidate, if that is possible. The term suggests to me something to be prepared for the dinner table, but I am willing to be corrected. - I am, etc. KIWIPOM.

Quote:  <i>BOX OF BIRDS</i>: After hearing this from another New Zealander, I tried out the phrase on many people in the South of England and London. Not one person had heard of it, and most were unable, from first hearing (in context), to judge its actual meaning or inference.
