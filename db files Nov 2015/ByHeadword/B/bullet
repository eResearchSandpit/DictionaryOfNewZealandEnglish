Quote:  <i>FRIGATE TUNA</i> (Frigate mackerel)<i> Auxis thazard</i> ... The frigate tuna is a slender fish and is the smallest of the tunas found in the New Zealand region ... They are called bullets by tuna fishermen and can cause a great deal of trouble to purse seiners working skipjack schools [by gilling themselves in the net and taking time to remove].
