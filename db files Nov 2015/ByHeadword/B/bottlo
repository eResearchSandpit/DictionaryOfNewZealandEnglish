Quote:  There was [postal] work [in the 1960s], hard satisfying work. Unloading parcel bags, huge cumbersome containers nicknamed pre-fabs, from a three-door Z. There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers.
