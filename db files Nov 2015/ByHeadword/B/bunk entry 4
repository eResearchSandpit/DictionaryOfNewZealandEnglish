Quote:  `Truancy' is by no means an objective word ... `Why are you bunking?' I said to a Maori pupil I met in the Square an hour before school officially finished. `I'm waiting for a bus, sir.' `Well, you're still bunking' ... `Sir, I'm on my way home. Bunking is when you hang around the square instead of going to school or home'.
