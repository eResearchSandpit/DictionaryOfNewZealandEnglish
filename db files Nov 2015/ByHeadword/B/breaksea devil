Quote:  All the people frequenting this coast [sc. west coast of Otago] believe in the existence of an extraordinary bird, or phantom, which they can never see, but only hear rushing past them through the air with the rapidity of a falling rocket, and making a terrible rushing sound. The Maories declare that it is a bird possessing many joints in its wings. The whalers call them

<i>break-sea-devils,</i> after the name of an island where this phenomenon is of most frequent occurrence.

Quote:   The strange birdcall [hakuwai] seems to have been limited to only some of the muttonbird islands in the South Cape area. These were Poutaima, Big Island, Solomons and the Green Island, though a similar strange bird, called by whalers the Breaksea Devil, was said to be heard on Breaksea Island.
