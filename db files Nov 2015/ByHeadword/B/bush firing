Quote:  The houses in this neighbourhood have been in some danger from bush firings ... then just as several people had lighted their clearings a strong gale from the south-east, what is called here `the mountain wind', sprang up. In a few hours all the dead trees and stumps in the neighbourhood were on fire.
