Quote:  Next morning we had to be up early to reach the tops before the merinos broke camp and started back for the country off which they had been mustered. ... At this stage, it was essential to get around the sheep before they broke camp, for to muster them again after they had begun to scatter would take many hours.
Notes:  [f. c1869]
