Quote:  TIGER SHARK] TIGER SHARK (<i>Lamna glauca</i>). ... In New South Wales it is called the blue pointer, and, as Mr. Hill tells us, is `not only a very powerful, but perhaps the most bold of any of the large sharks visiting our shores. ... [118] Although there is some doubt on the subject, <i>Lamna glauca</i> is considered to be the mako of the Maoris, which is mainly found in the neighbourhood of Mayor Island. ... Mango, it should be remembered, seems [119] almost a generic name for shark in the North, as there is the mango-taniwha, a large variety; the mango-pare, the hammerheaded shark; the mango-reremai, the common dog-fish; the mango-pekepeke, and the mango-aruroa.
