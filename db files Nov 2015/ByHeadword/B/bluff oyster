Quote:  The Bluff oyster, we believe, is our most noble heritage. It is the big band of oysters, insistently pounding its message to the senses. It is closely rivalled by the Nelson oyster which, you will understand if you know Nelson, is an oyster of a rather more culturally-conscious sort, more your chamber music ensemble oyster, seducing the senses with subtlety.
