Quote:  Many people would have picked Frano Botica instead of Grant Fox, for example. The bring-back-Buck brigade made as much noise as we are about Cully.

Quote:  You can always rely on a cricket crowd to put a new spin on an old situation. "Bring back buck" has had a shelf life much longer than that of another All Black captain, Wayne "Buck" Shelford...Spotted at Sunday's one-day international at Napier, a banner reading "Bring Back Judy".

Quote:  The single thing that would do most to improve life in New Zealand is jobs, jobs and more jobs. Equally heartfelt but perhaps less practical suggestions were : Bring back Buck, blow up the Beehive, abolish all laws to cut the crime rate, drain Lake Rotorua, send the water to the South Island and paint the lake blue so it can be used as a swimming pool, get rid of the rest of the world, move the country closer to the equator, put cocaine in the water supply and have more dogs like Spot.

Quote:  Although it's not quite up there with Bring Back Buck, the campaign to stop the extinction of the Mowat - slow moving and somewhat anachronistic native fauna of National Radio's week-day afternoons - is gathering momentum.

Quote:  We refer, of course, to Bring Back Buck, that unofficial Kiwi ensign with the slogan painted in black, usually on the backdrop of an almost-white bedsheet taken from someone's flat. All other suggestions for a new flag are meaningless compared with Bring Back Buck. It speaks to us of Maori and Pakeha striving together for an outcome that will make the nation proud.
