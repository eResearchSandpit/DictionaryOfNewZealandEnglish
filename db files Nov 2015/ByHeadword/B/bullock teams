Quote:  Another play unknown at a later date was the widespread Bullock Teams: It was easy to make a team of working bullocks from pieces of supplejack, with their opposite branches doing duty as horns. The manufacture of yokes, substitutes for chains and model sledges gave a boy the pleasant feeling that accompanies successful achievement. Leading the team by a piece of string was the next step. (1870; Waipu)
