Quote:  As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfacers,' as they are called, examine the coast-line near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient. <i>Ibid.</i> 364-365 In the descriptive part of this publication I have already alluded to the black-sand beachers, who watch the coast principally ... where small indentations favour the preservation of magnetic ... iron-sands

Quote:  Generally the greater portion of the sand is removed, but in favourable spots, sheltered either by a slight indentation in the coast-line, or by some large pieces of drifted timber, its heavier particles remain; these consist [529] of black iron-sand (both magnetic and titaniferous oxide of iron) associated with small garnets and with gold. These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.
