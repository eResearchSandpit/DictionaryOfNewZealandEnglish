Quote:  Blue water title may be another term that is not used, or little used, outside New Zealand. NSOD does not record it. nor does DNZE. Perhaps a popular rather than a lawyers' term, it refers to a piece of privately owned land that extends below high water mark, an unusual but not unknown occurrence.
