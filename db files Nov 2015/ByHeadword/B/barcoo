Quote:  Another memory that lingered on the trip, was that from Napier to Gisborne, to inspect a property known as `Te Rapa' and nearby was a `pubbery' (certainly not a hotel, for anybody would wonder why the Licensed Victuallers Association ever granted a licence for meals or liquor to be dispensed), and was typically designated `The Trap'. Truly, this pubbery was just short of shanty, typical of the `Outer Barcoo', but where Maories, their Wahines, or broken down `Remittancers' could drown their sorrows, wander into the `arms of Bacchus' or chase pink elephants.
