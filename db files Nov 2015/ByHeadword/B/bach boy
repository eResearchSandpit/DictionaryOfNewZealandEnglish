Quote:  Among the "bach boys" - young bloods from the city who came for summer weekends filled with wild parties during the 1910s, 20s and 30s - were those who would become prominent citizens in time: Bernard Freyberg, leading public servant Joe Heenan and Claude Skelley, a future headmaster of Day's Bay's Wellesley College.
