Quote:  GLOBE-FISH <i>Contusus richei</i> (Freminville) ... It has several other popular names such as Balloon-fish and Mouse-fish. In America it is known as Rabbit-fish and Stink-fish. The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. The names Globe-fish and Balloon-fish were given because of the animal's habit of inflating itself with air to such an extent that the body was like a lamp globe or an inflated balloon.
