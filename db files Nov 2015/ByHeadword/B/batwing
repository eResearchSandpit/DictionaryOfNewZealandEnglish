Quote:   Our camp has not yet been described, and ... it is the simplest and best form of shelter for a party of two, ... It is an invention of Douglas's, and we call it a `batwing'. In the ordinary course of camp life, survey parties can have their loads packed on horseback, and carry tent and fly, with a second smaller fly to pitch at the end of the tent to shelter the fire. We ... [51] could not afford to take such a weighty camp. We therefore pitch an ordinary 6 ft. by 8 ft. canvas tent, on a ridge pole, with an 8 ft. by 10 ft. fly six inches above it; and cut the tent in half along the ridge, and taking away one half, leave the other half standing. This is just large enough to allow two men to lie `heads and tails'. [The side left open, and one side of fly raised 4 ft. in middle, and under this the fire burns so have shelter in wet weather.]
