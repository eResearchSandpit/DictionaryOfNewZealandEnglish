Quote:  The importance of bush apiaries in beekeeping.. Gradually through the years beekeepers have been discovering the value of bush apiaries financially and for the upkeep of their apiaries on clover lands. Today many commercial beekeepers have one or more bush apiraies established..Most beekeepers prefer to work hives of Italian bees and have used them when they have established their bush apiaries...Some beekeepers, however, prefer to keep a hybrid strain in their bush apiaries.
