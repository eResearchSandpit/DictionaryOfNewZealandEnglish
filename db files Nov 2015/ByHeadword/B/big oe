Quote:  Now the average Kiwi going on his or her OE is older and, arguably, smarter. Far from funding their OE working in a London pub, they're more likely to work in an office... Auckland's Jess Startup, 24, who went overseas in 1998, believes the pub-working OE is a thing of the past for most New Zealanders... For example, going to teach English in Korea or Japan is a lucrative way of having a Big OE.
