Quote:  <i>Fagus Solandri.</i> - The most common name of this tree is `black-birch,' but it has several other names. In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both
`red-birch' and `bull-birch.' The most suitable name is `red-beech.'

Quote:  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech' ...

Quote:  [this cit. not spec. repeated in individual entries] [In Oxford Forest] I learned that the tree [F. solandri, entire-leaved beech ] was termed [red, brown, white, black, and yellow] birch at different stages of its growth, but the application of these terms differed greatly; perhaps Black Birch was most generally applied to the mature condition before decay commenced, and White birch to the young state; but there were too many exceptions to allow the names to be anything but misleading.

Quote:  The perversity with which the true `beeches' have become popularly known as `birches,' and different kinds of `mapau' as `maples - a popular name which includes small trees of widely distinct Natural Order, is enough to fill with despair any botanist who desires to foster a system of popular names that will be free from misleading and inaccurate suggestions.

Quote:   '... the term birch may be regarded as a generic name applied by bushmen to any small-leaved tree, and qualified by the prefixes `black', `white' or `red' at the caprice of the individual or as may be suggested by the colour of its foliage, bark or timber.' So the term `black birch' was in many districts applied to Pittosporum tenuifolium [ ] and to Weinmannia racemosa [Kamahi] in Otago - the latter tree being also known as `brown birch' or `red birch.' Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it
has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made
of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word.

Quote:   ... it is perhaps futile to hope that the more exact name [beech] will become popular ; but we might at least expect some consistent nomenclature to be adopted through the islands. At present the various species are designated almost indifferently, white, red, black, silver birch etc. What is white birch in one part of the country may be black in another ... The use of the name <i>birch</i> in place of <i>beech</i> is inexcusable, though ... N. Menziesii ... [shows] some external resemblance to the English birch.

Quote:  Colour Coding  [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.
