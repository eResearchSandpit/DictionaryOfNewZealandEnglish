Quote:   From Cape Maria van Diemen a number of fish termed `blue-fish' are recorded. The same returns also record rock-cod. I am quite unable to suggest what fish is meant by `blue-fish,' unless, indeed, the observer has used the names indiscriminately. These fish were very numerous, were taken during every month of the year, and fed chiefly on mussel, but occasionally on small fish. They weighed from 1lb to 2lb each.
