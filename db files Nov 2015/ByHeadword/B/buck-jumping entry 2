Quote:  Apart from simple climbing there was, for example, `crossing' the plantation on the treetops, and Rough-riding, in which one player sat on a fir tree branch while the others took the end of it and pulled it up and down and then let it go flying up in the air. The player who could stay on the longest was the rough-riding champion. Of a similar nature was Buck-jumping, in which individual players rode a macrocarpa or gum branch [113] to see who could rise the highest.
