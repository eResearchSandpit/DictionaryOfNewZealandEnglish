Quote:  Button-eye, a wandering bird (Zosterops halmaturina), blight-bird; twinkie; button-eye; wax-eye; ring-eye. Tauhou means stranger, and this name was given by the Maori when the bird appeared, in 1856, in the central part of New Zealand, gradually spreading north and south till the the islands were occupied. It is an Australian bird, and was blown across the Tasman sea in the year mentioned.
