Quote:  He sits out on the Ross Sea ice in McMurdo Sound for hours each day, catching small, free-swimming fish called borch. ... <i>Pagothenia borchgrevinki</i>, named after a Russian explorer reputed to be the first man to set foot on the Antarctic continent, could well have been called Boris or Ivan because a seaman went ashore first to hold Captain Borchgrevinki's boat.
