Quote:  Dan Freel's conversation [as an Irish settler] was plentifully interlarded with oaths and obscurities that are - or would have been in the [18]80's - quite unprintable. At first it seemed an arresting, if not an interesting idiosyncracy, but one sickened of it. ... The sanguinary adjective too that sounds so daring but really has no significance whatever, he used between every second word, even between syllables as `I bloody well told the bloody mongrel that he was too ego-bloody-istical.' After the first few sentences this gave no gain in force and much loss in time. I noticed that the Irishmen, though they obviously bowed to Dan's smallest word, did not give him the sincerest flattery of imitation in this respect.
