Quote:  Molecular biologists at Otago University isolated a marker in 1992 for the booroola or "fecundity B" gene which produces between 60 and 100 extra lambs from every 100 sheep. Agricultural scientists have said the booroola gene can lead to lambing rates of 190 per cent in merinos, but does not always mean prolific lambing.
