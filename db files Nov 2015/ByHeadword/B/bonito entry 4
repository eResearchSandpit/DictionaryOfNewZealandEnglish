Quote:  The only true mackerels recorded from Canterbury are the Pacific Bonito (<i>Sarda chiliensis </i>) and the large-scaled Tunny (<i>Gasterochisma melampus </i>) which may reach a length of 6 feet; but a related family includes the well-known Barracouta (<i>Thyrsites atun </i>), the King Barracouta, <i>Jordanidia solandrii </i> (often known locally as Kingfish, but not to be confused with the North Island Kingfish which is a form or Yellowtail) and the elongated, silvery-hued frost fish (<i>Lepidopus caudatus </i>) whose curious stranding habits can hardly yet be said to be satisfactorily explained.
