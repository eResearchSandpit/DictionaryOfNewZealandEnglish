Quote:  The cementing medium of the deposit is finely comminuted fresh mica-schist, resembling coarsely ground cement, hence the term `cement' applied by the miners to this and similar deposits. In the zone of weathering the `cement' is a rusty-brown colour ... Below the zone of weathering lies the unaltered `cement' which forms the `blue ground' of the miners.
