Quote:  It's a story of the vision of New Zealander Roger Beattie who, in 1989, established the                 first ocean based blue pearl farm at Whangamoe Inlet on New Zealand's Chatham Islands...

Although most of the nucleation process is kept a secret, the Eyris Blue Pearl Company are continuing to refine the art of attaching a seed to the  inside of the shell, beneath the mantle, so that a blue pearl mabe can develop... Once the seed is inserted beneath the mantle, the paua begins to overlay this nucleus with its brilliant mother-of-pearl, made up of layer upon layer of conchiolin and nacre.
