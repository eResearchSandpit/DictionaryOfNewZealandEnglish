Quote:  A heifer being taught to go into the milking-bail usually has a rope first passed over her horns by means of a long stick, so.. she can be drawn into the position required, where she is secured by fastening the bails, and then, her leg being tied, she can be milked safely. This being repeated a few times with each cow, is generally sufficient to teach them to walk in of themselves afterwards when driven up to the bail.
