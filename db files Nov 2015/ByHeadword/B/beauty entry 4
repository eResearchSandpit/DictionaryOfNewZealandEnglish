Quote:  ... the noun + y form [e.g. germy, bally] as the preferred method of forming adjectives may help to explain the use of such a word as `beauty' for `beautiful': Beauty smell, eh? Yeah, they're beauty, eh? although here, of course, the meaning of `beauty' is considerably less aesthetic than the Pakeha concept and has little connection with physical beauty or attractiveness.
