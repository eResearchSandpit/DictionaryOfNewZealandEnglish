Quote:  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Quote:  In front of him was a massive, rust-covered iron dish, with a big iron block inside it. ... `That's a berdan,' replied Mr Alexander. ... `You place crushed ore inside the revolving bowl. ... The iron block stays still, grinding the ore into a slime. Water flows into the dish and spills over the edge carrying the lighter gold-free particles and slurry with it. Then mercury is added to absorb or amalgamate the gold and silver. It's usually used for testing the ore.
