Notes: Jim Cameron  writes: The importance of the beach as a NZ icon suggests that there might be some distinctive NZE compounds. OED has <i>*beach bag, *beach ball, *beach buggy, *beach bum, beach flea, *beachfront, beach grass, beach plum, beach rock, *beachwear</i>. Macquarie 1981 has also <i>beach break</i> (a surfing term), <i>beach hut, beach inspector, *beach mat, *beach robe, beachworm</i> <i>*surf beach</i> - in NZPOD - and <i>*ocean beach</i>. As well I have seen <i>beach music, *beach picnic</i> and <i>beach volleyball</i> recently in overseas publications. [*Known to me as in NZ use or former use also]. <i>Beachfront</i> is tagged in OED as chiefly US, and all citations refer to places outside the UK. It has long been used in NZ. NZ citations?

Quote:  Note, In speaking of Mercury Bay I had forgot to mention that the Mangrove trees found there produce a resinous substance very much like rosin, something of this kind I am told is found in both the East and West Indias. We found it first in small lumps upon the Sea beach, but afterwards found it sticking to the Mangrove trees and by that means found out from whence it had come.

Quote:  We stopped at Hampden.. walking higgledy-piggledy carrying kits and rugs down to the picnic ground by the beach with its beach 'dunny', the dark stained wooden seat split down the middle, the concrete floor puddled muddy and salt-smelling. <i>Ibid.</i> 51 Along the path from the lean-to, the 'dunny' beside the cypress tree and soon known as 'the cypress', was covered with the small fragrant roses known to us as 'dunny roses', and was without a door, while the dunny seat, long and wide like a beach dunny, was set over a deep hole half-filled with old 'kiki' (our word for faeces) in varying shades of brown, topped with faded pieces of newspaper, the <i>Oamaru Mail</i> and the <i>Otago Daily Times</i>.
