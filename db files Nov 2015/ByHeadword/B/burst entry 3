Quote:  The north-west wind ... something like the ... `hot winds' of Australia ... is almost invariably succeeded by one from the south-west, which in the summer time is a cool and pleasant guest, but in the winter season what is aptly termed `a burst', and sometimes lasts for two or three days, being generally accompanied by rain if not by snow and sleet. This wind is similar to the well-known `south-easter' of New Zealand, which, here, tends up with the land, and so has a south-westerly direction.
