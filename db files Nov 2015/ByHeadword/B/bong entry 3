Quote:  He writes about five young men who went on a week-long camping holiday ... taking with them a car-load of beer and a curious collection of plastic tubing and large funnels; the equipment needed for alcohol bonging: ... The bong comprises a plastic funnel joined at the base by a long plastic tube, it can be large or small. It can hold from one to four bottles of beer. One person holds the contraption high in the air while the intended recipient puts the end of the tube in his mouth and allows the beer to rush in a torrent into his stomach. ... Four bottles is said to test the digestive system to the limit and is almost impossible to keep down and so usually leads to what is called a `power chunder' or projectile vomiting.
