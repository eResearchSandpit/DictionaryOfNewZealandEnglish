Quote:  Perhaps the most recurrent and universal of rough games in the early period was

<i>Cockfighting</i> (K-78). This was a free-for-all contest in which a smaller boy mounted on the back of a bigger boy and the two endeavored [sic] to dislodge all other riders by pushing or [202] pulling them over. ... Sometimes the game was known as a Piggy-back Contest or as Pulling Off. `One trick of the game was to "buck-jump" your rider, which consisted in jerking your elbows so that the rider was lifted over your head' (Naseby, Otago, 1905).
