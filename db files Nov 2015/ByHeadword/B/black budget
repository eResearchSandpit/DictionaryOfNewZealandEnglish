Quote:  June 26 [1958]. Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer presented his first Budget, increasing taxes on beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco. Known ever after as the Black Budget, it was a response to a balance of payments crisis and introduced cheap housing loans and the Pay-As-You-Earn (Paye) tax system.

Quote:  In 1930 J.G. Coates had called Ward's budget `the Black Budget' [PD 1931, 229, 88] - but that was long forgotten. This time the label stuck. Nordmeyer's budget [of June 1958] was remembered as `the black budget' for many years. It can be argued that it was good for `the country'. For the government it was a suicidal mistake. It was the biggest blunder in Nash's political career. Although he was not immediately and directly responsible, he was the leader and did not say `No'.

Quote:   It would not be an exaggeration to say that [Mr Nordmeyer] was respected as much outside the Labour Party, as he was within it, ... and although his `Black Budget' was known as the cause of the fall of the Labour Government, it was recognised as the anti-dote for the economic situation at that time.

Quote:  On June 26, 1958, Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer presented his first budget. It has gone down in political history as the "black budget" and it helped consign its author to political purgatory... In a statement issued on the night of the budget speech the two presidents of the North and South Island Motor Unions called it "black Thursday" and Federation of Labour strongman Fintan Patrick Walsh was soon labelling it the "black budget".
