Quote:  BROAD-LEAVED PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago major</i>), also called ratstail, birdseed, lamb's tongue, and greater plantain, is common on roadsides and trodden places throughout the country and in pastures in the King Country. ... From the middle of the rosette ascends the flower stalk ..., which afterwards give[s] place to seeds, and produce[s] the ratstail appearance that gives the plant one of its trivial names.
