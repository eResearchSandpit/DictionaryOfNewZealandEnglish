Quote:  I begin with an occasion when I had dinner in a house in the bush at Karekare on Auckland's west coast. We sat around a German coal range the couple had hauled by means of wood-track bush railway to the top of the hill on which they had built their house. On a nog in the unlined room was propped an old photograph.
