Quote:  The rarest of New Zealand's 12 species of <i>Metrosideros</i> was discovered less than 20 years ago by Papakura teacher and botanist the late John Bartlett... Like the northern rata, <i>M. robusta</i>, Bartlett's rata usually starts life as an epiphyte perched in the branches of another tree or ponga... Although some of New Zealand's shrub ratas have white flowers, this species is the only tree to have them.
