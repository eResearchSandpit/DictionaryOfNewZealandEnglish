Quote:  On both sides [of the Southern Alps] grows the sub-alpine vegetation in all its beauty. You may walk knee-deep in Mountain Lilies, you may pick Edelweiss [fn] by the handfull [sic]; the air at a certain season of the year is full of the fragrance of the Alpine Broom [fn 2]. [fn] The Mountain Lily is ... a buttercup, and the Edelweiss does not belong to the same genus as its European namesake. [fn 2] <i>Carmichaelia grandiflora</i>, var. <i>alba. </i>

Quote:  We have climbed above the pines [on the West Coast]; ... and up here on the mountain side the vegetation is the flowering <i>rata</i>, the <i>akeake</i>, the native alpine broom, the white blossomed ribbonwood, ... the flax-like<i> kiekie</i>, and the semi-tropical <i>neinei</i>, half-shrub, half-palm, and whole forests of fern trees.
