Quote:  In <i>Pied</i>, a tight target-like knot of 50 black stilt heads is surrounded by a "widespread" (3nm in diameter) flock of pied stilts. This is a direct reference to the fact that in 1980 there were only 50 black stilts left in the world. One of the threats to the species was that it had begun inter-breeding with pied stilts.

Quote:   New Zealand boasts four endemic waders not found elsewhere in the world. These are the black stilt, now limited to a few pairs nesting on high ground in the centre of the South Island; the shore plover, confined entirely to a small island off the Chathams, where its numbers are fairly strong; and the New Zealand dotterel, red-breasted in summer, rather curiously nesting in two discrete groups, one in the Hauraki Gulf, the other far away at and around Stewart Island -
