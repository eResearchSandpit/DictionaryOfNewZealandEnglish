Quote:  Every year hundreds of Wellingtonians make the pilgrimage north to Auckland to thrash their heads in the Big Day Out mosh pit, as well as soak up some northern rays... The first ever Big Day Out, in 1992, was headline by bands Smashing Pumpkin and Soundgarden and over the years many top international acts have come over.
