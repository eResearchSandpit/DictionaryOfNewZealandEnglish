Quote:  Ken and he went right through knuckle bones twice without any faults. `What do you think is the hardest of all?' said Creamy. Ken considered. He pushed the knuckle bones about the ground with his finger as he thought. `I reckon big jingles,' he said. `Ten big jingles on the go,' said Creamy. `I challenge you to ten big jingles without a fault.'
