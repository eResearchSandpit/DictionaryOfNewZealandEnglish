Quote:  A prominent feature ... is the massive pile of buildings which forms the central location of the Civil Service of the Colony. `The Buildings', as they are locally designated, have the appearance of being thoroughly substantial and permanent in character, and it is not a little surprising to a stranger, and destructive of his appreciation, to find that the ponderous edifice is constructed of wood. It is certainly claimed for the structure that it is the largest wooden one of a permanent character in the world, but that is a distinction which, even if it is deserved, is one perhaps of questionable honor.
