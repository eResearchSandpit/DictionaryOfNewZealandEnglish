Quote:  Given to me by erudite colleague Ian Harris, bespredel is a Russian word for a situation we recognise but have no single label for. In growing use by Russian commentators despairing of the situation in their country, it simultaneously denotes hopelessness, deep distress, rampant cynicism and antisocial behavioiur. It implies no limits, anything goes and a universal "I'm all right, Jack" attitude.
