Quote:  BASTARD RED COD <i>Physiculus (Pseudophycis) breviusculus</i> (Richardson) The vernacular name of this fish was first given to it by commercial fishmen who, when one was hooked and brought to the surface, would exclaim: ` - another bastard Red Cod!' meaning to say it was not a true Red Cod; the name stuck to this fish and was used by line fishermen of Otago.
