Quote:  The Conservation department had consulted Ngai Tahu and proposed to adopt nationally the tribe's traditional name of "tokoeka" for the southern species, he said. Tokoeka, literally translated as weka with a rod or walking stick, will be the name of the Haast, Stewart Island and Fiordland varieties of brown kiwi and the other [sic] will be the North Island and Okarito.
