Also occas. used for species of other general thought to resemble Nothofagus. occas. (usu. overseas usage) New Zealand birch.

Quote:   On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused
by beech trees. There was no further comment from the Moguls in Head Office.

Quote:  Capt. Cook has given so good a description of the Spruce Fir, that it is impossible to mistake it. But he has not taken any notice of the Pitch Pine - Birch - And large Myrtle. ... The Birch is only fit for fuel - Its uncommon whiteness would cause it to be preferred for decks, &c. but it splits with the smallest blow, and, of all the woods at Duskey Bay it is the least durable - It grows from a large stump about 50-60 & even 70 feet with branches included. The boughs spread more than any other tree and the bark is generally white, somewhat resembling the hazel in England.

Quote:  <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodgkinson, August 9, 1854.)
