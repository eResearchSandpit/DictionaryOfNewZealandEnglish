Quote:  NO. A.89. - OCYDROMUS FUSCUS, <i>Du Bus</i>. Kelp-hen, Blackwood hen. It abounds in the many inlets and sounds of the south-west coast of this island. The only place where we noticed that it seemed shy was in Milford Sound. As soon as the tide begins to recede these dusky Rails come out on the shore to feed amongst the kelp.
