Quote:  The third ... is <i>Pisonia Brunoniana,</i> the parapara, or `bird-catcher' of the settlers. ... As is well known, the seed-pods of the<i> Pisonia</i> exude a sticky substance, which it is stated will ensnare the smaller birds that come into contact with the gluey mass - hence the name `bird-catcher plant'.
