Quote:  The season promised to be a good one for bush-burning; and those who had bush-felled were congratulating themselves on the prospect of getting excellent `burns,' while many, who, ... had been unfortunate in getting bad `burns,' were now hopeful of clearing off much of the timber by means of a second fire.
