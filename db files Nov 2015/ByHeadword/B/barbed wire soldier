Quote:  Those inflicted with venereal disease were treated as criminals.(?) A large venereal disease hospital was established near the Australian lines and run by the Australians for both Australians and New Zealanders. It was surrounded by barbed wire and guards to prevent men breaking out. Men unfortunate enough to be so caught earned the sobriquet `barbed wire' soldiers: `and it was rumoured that there were sufficient officers and men to form a whole battalion from colonel down - not omitting the padre.'
