Quote:  When two mobs of sheep get mixed accidentally it is called a box. (1) When you put two mobs of sheep together on purpose, you box them. (2) When they join by accident they are said to <i>get boxed</i>. In fact, the active voice of the verb signifies intention; the passive, accident. ([1898 Morris Austral-English])
