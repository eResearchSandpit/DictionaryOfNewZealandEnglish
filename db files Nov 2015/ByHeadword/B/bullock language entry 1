Quote:  If the English sailors have acquired a not undeserved reputation for their curses, surely the New Zealand bullock-drivers must be reckoned superior to them in this accomplishment, for such an assortment of fantastic oaths from all kingdoms of Nature, Heaven and Hell I have never heard before from mortal lips. Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.' To this argument advanced by the driver with a good-natured smile I naturally could find no reply. I refer it to the linguists to enrol this new language in the appropriate family of dialects.

Quote:  Bullock drivers are seldom choice in their language under the most favourable circumstances, but to drive a team with a load of firewood ..., from Papanui to Christchurch, was a work of so much difficulty, that the flow of bullock language was more than ordinarily profuse [March 1852].
