Quote:  Buzzy bee, made from 1948 by Auckland company H.E. Ramsay, was copied from a toy brought from the United states, the Ramsay family confirmed yesterday... A worker at the factory in 1948 brought an American Buzzy bee toy to Mr Ramsay, and suggested something similar be made...The American Buzzy bee was flat-sided, about one and a half inches thick, made from timber with a metal clacker and covered by painted paper. That accurately describes the Fisher Price bee, which Oamaru man Gerald Lynch-Blosse bought in Arkansas about five years ago.

Quote:  <i>Buzzy Bee</i> although now made in China of some wood other than native tawa, this dinkum Kiwi wooden bumblebee, which has been pulled along by generations of toddlers who have delighted in its clacking wings (once wood, now plastic), was the creation of Auckland toymaker Hec Ramsay back c.1946. Once Prince William declared an interest it became a worldwide plaything.
