Quote:  The Bludger. He was known among the boobheads as that. When they called him by his name you felt they were being intentionally respectful. ... But connected with him it didn't mean what it was supposed to mean. A bludger is a pimp, a man who lives on women, but I doubt if anyone thought specifically that of him. Bludger is also what it sounds, a fairly indiscriminate term of abuse. When the boobheads called him that they meant a lot of things. A bully, something sly, a chap who'd put a dirty one on to you, not necessarily for any purpose other than it gave him pleasure to do so.

Quote:  a bludger is a SPONGER - someone who is always borrowing and rarely repaying. To bludge is to borrow. It's socially acceptable to say `may I bludge a cigarette (or a cup of sugar)' but calling someone a bludger can be a fighting insult.

Quote:  Coming from the sheltered upbringing of New Zealand, where misguided and ill-thought-out benefit policies by well-meaning governments have produced a generation of bludgers - sons and daughters of people on the dole deciding to follow their parents into the family business, rather than actually work for a living.
