Quote:  VIPER'S BUGLOSS (<i>Echium vulgare</i>), also called blue weed and by mistake, blue borage, occurs on roadsides, river-beds, and fields in both islands, though it is commoner in the south, and especially in Marlborough. It is an annual or biennial with a deep penetrating tap root and a stem 2 to 3 ft high.
