Quote:  The salt gradually forms big chunk crystals that fall to the bottom of the pond, forming a crust. The spent brine, or "bitterns", by now too bitter to be of further use, is drained off and sent back to sea, leaving the salt crust to dry out and be scooped up by a bulldozer-like machine, its blade tipped with a series of fork-like tines.
