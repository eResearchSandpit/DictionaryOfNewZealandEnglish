Of course it occurs nearly everywhere, but in the districts mentioned it has in certain localities taken possession.

Quote:  I wonder why I used the word `Brambles'. I'm disturbed by it, because really only the Poms call them `brambles'! We say `blackberries'! It is really discouraging to catch a note of pretension or plagiarism, as if while composing my poems, I had some one else's poems in my head.
