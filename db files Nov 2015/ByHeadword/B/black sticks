Quote:  And even the All Whites is OK , because they were the first to rip off the All Blacks. But then every man and his dog was doing it, and with each stupid title our sports team gave themselves, we sank deeper into the murky abyss, with the Tall Blacks, Tall Ferns, Black Caps and Black Sticks dragging us down at double speed.  When I heard that one of our teams had actually named themselves "Wheel Blacks", I wondered whether we had finally settled in the sludge at the bottom.
