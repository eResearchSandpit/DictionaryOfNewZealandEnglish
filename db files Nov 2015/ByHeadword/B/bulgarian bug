Quote:  And over in the kitchen they ... were all set to go; but Mrs Anderson was trying to remember if there was anything she had forgotten. Yes, to put some fresh milk on the Bulgarian bug. Though it could wait. [note 215] ... - bacillus bulgaricus, the special yoghurt culture.

Quote:  When the great Bulgarian Bug craze hit the town I connected it with Mr Kostoff; this was something secret too. Kept in a covered jar in the darkest corner of the kitchen safe. smelling of sour milk, the Bug seethed with a life of its own - that sinister mould held mysteries, of that I was more than sure... Now I wonder if it wasn't some kind of fertility cult the women built around the Bulgarian Bug; what they did with it I never knew.
