Quote:   <i>[Notho]fagus Cliffortioides,</i> Hook. f. ... Mountain beech. Black Birch of portions of Wellington, Canterbury, Otago and Southland. White Birch of Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. Barely distinguished by the woodman from Entire-leaved beech. The mountain beech bears a close resemblance to the entire-leaved beech in general appearance, although it never attains the extreme dimensions of that species.
