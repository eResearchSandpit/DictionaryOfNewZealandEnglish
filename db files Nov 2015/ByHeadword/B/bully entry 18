Quote:  BULLIES: Sub-order GOBIOIDEA Bullies are not the same as cockabullies. The family these rather severe-faced fishes belong to is widely distributed over moderately warm and even tropical countries, and reaches its southern most distribution in New Zealand. The bully family is called Gobiidae by some writers, Eleotridae by others. Bullies are spiny-rayed fishes with the paired ventral fins placed well foward; they have a genital papilla for passing out eggs or sperms; and the males look different from the females. Two genera are recognised at present, <i>Gobiomorphus</i> and <i>Philypnodon. </i>
