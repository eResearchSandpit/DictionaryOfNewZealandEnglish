Quote:  One curious diversion, which may have had its origins in `I spy', was a game in the back seat of a car. The passing scene would be scanned for a white horse or a series of objects which, when seen, would provoke a shout of `Beaver!' The call probably originated in the fact that a bearded man was often a target in the game.
