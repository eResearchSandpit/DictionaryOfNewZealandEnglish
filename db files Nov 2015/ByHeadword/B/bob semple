Quote:  The mixed train which arrived at Rewanui about 11.30 p, Sunday to Thursday was known as the 'Paddy Webb' or 'Bob Semple' after the miners who became Cabinet Ministers in the first Labour Government, and who first arranged this train to make it easier for the miners changing shift at midnight.
