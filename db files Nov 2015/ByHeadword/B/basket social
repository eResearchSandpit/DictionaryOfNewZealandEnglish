Quote:  (Joe Gasparich, Northland kauri country), The way in which the bush people - the bushmen and their wives - stuck to one another is shown by the way they rallied round in the case of a family that was in need. A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ...

Quote:  Basket socials were always a stir [in Northland c1920s]. ... Basket socials were the nearest we got to bacchanalia - tipsy cake in large doses could have strangely affecting results.

Quote:  And then the mill workers organized a big basket social for us, and with the money they arranged a grand picnic. <i>Ibid.</i> 153 [pre WW1, Northland bush], A basket social took the form of a dance, with an auction of supper baskets. Each girl would make a pretty basket and fill it with good things for supper. When supper-time came, the baskets were auctioned from the stage and keen was the rivalry and competition for some of the baskets, young blades emptying their pockets and often dipping into their bank accounts in trying to out-bid their rivals.
