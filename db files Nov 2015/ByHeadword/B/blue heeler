Quote:  The other distinctive breed of Australian working dog is the cattle dog, known variously as the Australian heeler, blue heeler, or Queensland heeler. It is also sometimes incorrectly called

the Blue Merle, but this is simply the description of a colour type, not the name of a breed, and in any case the phrase should be `blue merled'.
