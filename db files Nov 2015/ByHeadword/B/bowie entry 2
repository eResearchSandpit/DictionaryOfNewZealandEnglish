Quote:  Bowie has been under the notice of this Department [Agriculture] for a good many years, and as long ago as 1930 was the subject of a report to the Director .. Bowie has a fairly widespread distribution in the South Island. Bowie has been known in the Wairau Valley for some fifty years .. Such animals also recover if shifted soon enough on to topdressed paddocks on bowie properties.
