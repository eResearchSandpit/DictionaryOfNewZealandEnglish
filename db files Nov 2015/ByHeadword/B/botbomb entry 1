Quote:  A fair dinkum thoroughbred mongrel of a pacer ... Uncle Wally ... poured more oats, chaff, hay, good grass, time and bot-bombs into his miserable hide than all the cows were getting between them. <i>Ibid.</i> 124 Uncle Wally bought a brand-new sulky and patched up all the harness. Then he had to have a trailer and horseshoes and entry fees and more bot-bombs.
