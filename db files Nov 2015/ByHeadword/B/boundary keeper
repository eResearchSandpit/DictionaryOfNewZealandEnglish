Quote:  Boundary keeper A shepherd who keeps sheep from passing an unfenced boundary. He goes along the boundary once or twice a day or, if he has a convenient lookout, watches the sheep all day. In the old days any boundary keepers lived on their boundaries all the year and never saw anyone, except at mustering or by chance. The Australian word `boundary rider' has never been used in New Zealand; in fact, a boundary rider's work is different. He looks after the fences and sheep in a large paddock. (C.)
