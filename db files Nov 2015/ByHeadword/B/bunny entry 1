Notes: The Australian terms became suddenly popular (e.g. at Wellington Training College) after Feb-March 1951, after an article in the `Southern Cross' (and `Pix`). In 1952, although the Australian terms were known they were not used much. bunny (i.e. a long-eared one; descriptive of two long swish backs on either side of head) was perhaps by 1953 not so popular as milkbar cowboy or Cuba Street Yank.
