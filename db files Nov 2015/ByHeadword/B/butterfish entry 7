The spotty, or butterfish of our local fishermen, has been very plentiful this year ... <i>Ibid.</i> 11/384 The Wrasse and Parrotfish are mostly caught outside among the kelp, and with the Spotty are indiscriminately named Kelp-fish by the fishermen, though the term Butterfish is also given to the smaller sorts.

Quote:   SPOTTY (<i>Labrichthys bothrycosmus</i>). ... [92] According to Mr. Thompson's observations, the spotty is also known in Dunedin as the butter-fish, as when writing in 1877, he said: `The spotty, or butter-fish of our local fishermen, has been very plentiful this year, and had been brought to town in large numbers at times; was in the market 128 days, as against thirty-four days for last year.' ... adding in the most tantalizing manner possible, `There are two sorts of spotty - a big and a little.' And then, after saying the fishermen called them kelp-fish, writes: `Spotties in market 154 days'.

Quote:  In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. <i>Ibid.</i> 272  SPOTTY (PAEKIRIKIRI) <i>Pseudolabrus (Lunolabrus) celidotus </i>(Bloch and Schneider) ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 275] The name Spotty is derived from the presence of spots on each side of the fish. The name Butterfish used in the North Island for them is from the yellow or buttery colouring on the undersurface. In Canterbury they are called Guffy, but for what reason I have yet to learn. It is a very pretty fish, more especially when seen in the water.

Quote:  The popular name [spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) however refers to the general spotty nature of these fishes, and is quite appropriate. It is frequently, but quite incorrectly referred to as the Butterfish, and in Canterbury it is generally known as the `guffy'. <i>Ibid.</i> Spotty Pseudolabrus celidotus Butterfish; Guffy

Quote:   n2 (Stewart Island) Parochialism runs strong in most of us, and many will note indignantly the absence of a familiar local name. The difficulty is that Stewart Island butterfish = Wellington spotty, while Wellington butterfish = Stewart Island greenbone.
