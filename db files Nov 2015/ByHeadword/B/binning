Quote:  The wool removed by crutching is of low value and the amount per clip is usually small. For these reasons `crutchings' are seldom if ever classed except by the wool brokers when the wool is sent to them for binning. <i>Ibid.</i> 711 In `Binning,' the bales are broken up and classed into lines. This method of building up saleable lines is generally used in the case of small parcels of fleece wool and bales of oddments which cannot be included in the main lines without destroying their evenness. As each vendor's wool [712] is classed in the binning-room, the wool in each class is weighed and credited to the owner before being placed in its appropriate bin.
