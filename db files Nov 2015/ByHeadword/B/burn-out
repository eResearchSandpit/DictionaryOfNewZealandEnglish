Definition:From the 1930s at least, according to W. Martin and Bob Adams of NZ Seamen's Union, a bad discharge from a ship, a transferred and figurative usage from stoking the furnace of a coal-burning ship. An inefficient or tyro stoker who built a bad fire had a `burn-out' in the furnace - i.e. the fire went partially out. He was allowed to get away with one of these, but on doing a second, was eased off the ship. Hence it came to mean a bad discharge in general.
