Quote:  The Matiu/Somes hatchlings are just the second and third confirmed tuatara produced by Brothers Island tuatara (<i> Sphenodon guntheri </i> ) transferred to offshore islands ... These were the only two transfers of Brothers Island tuatara, directly from the island and from eggs hatched at Victoria University and raised at Nga Manu Nature Reserve in Waikanae.
