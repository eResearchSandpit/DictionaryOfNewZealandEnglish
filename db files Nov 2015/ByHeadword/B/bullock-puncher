Quote:  The whip was rawhide plaited sinnet, about six feet long, thick at the upper end, where it was fastened to a handle as long as itself, but tapering nearly to a point, to which was attached a narrow strip of rawhide, called `the fall,' finishing off with a twisted `cracker' made of `weetau' or dressed flax in [43] place of whipcord, and was a powerful flagellator in the hands of an experienced `bullock puncher.'

Quote:  A <i>bullock-puncher </i> is a man engaged to drive bullocks to market or port. The expression is painfully true, as these men, who receive but very poor wages, and are recruited from the worst class, ill treat the poor animals by <i>punching</i> their sides with a pointed stick.

Quote:   ~ Man employed to drive bullocks. The old nickname for him was <i>bullocky, bullock-puncher</i> being a much later word. Bullocks on the road have to feed until about 10 a.m., so that bullockies were generally lazy, slow starters in the morning. They were famous for swearing, and the old story of the parson who said, `Even a bullock driver has a soul to be saved' is still told up country. (C.; 1898 Morris Austral-English)
