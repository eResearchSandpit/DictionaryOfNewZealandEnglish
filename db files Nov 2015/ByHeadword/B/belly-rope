Quote:  The animal was at length brought with its head close up to the corner of the post [of the stockyard], the end of a small rope fastened to one of the rails ... was now passed rapidly round its body, and handed to the men outside to put round another rail and hold ... Almost at the same time that this `<i>belly-rope</i>', as it was called, was being fastened to keep the body of the animal upright, Harold would be putting a rope round one of the hind legs.
