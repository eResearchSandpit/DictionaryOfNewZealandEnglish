Quote:  There was one more sound that so far had gone unrecorded - a sound as of someone blowing across the top of an empty milk bottle with the power of a fog horn and the regularity of a heartbeat. This was the male kakapo booming - sitting inside the amphitheatre of his bowl, inflated into a feathered balloon, sending out a pulsing, low-frequency love call.
