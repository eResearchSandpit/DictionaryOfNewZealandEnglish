Quote:  The cattle ... were half-wild, restless brutes, imported from Australian back-stations, or bred on the equally wild ranges to the north of our own island. <i>Ibid.</i> 208 One evening, I remember a neighbouring back-station holder, after a long day's journey, rode up late along the fence-side of our home-paddocks, amidst a chorus of challenge from the sheep-dogs.
