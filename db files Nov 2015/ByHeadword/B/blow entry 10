Quote:  [Bank clerk] `By the time I had cleaned, or `blown' the gold, it was too late to think of returning. <i>Ibid.</i> 220 The gold is placed on a flat pear-shaped metal dish, with a perpendicular rim or edge except at the point of the pear, where there is no rim. This is moved in such a manner that the gold is tossed up, and all the finer particles and dirt are worked forward towards the opening, out by which the operator blows the sand.
