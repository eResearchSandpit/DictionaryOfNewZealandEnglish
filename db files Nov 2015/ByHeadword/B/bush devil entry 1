Quote:  In the middle of that cable there was a hell of a sag, and we could see no way to evade the tightening job. As equipment we had a `bush devil', a sort of wire-straining outfit on which two men are expected to apply a pressure up to twenty tons, and a massive wrench. Hooking the strainer on to the base of a handy tree we got its claws, or whatever you call them, gripped on the long cable, above the turn buckle, and worked the lever until the joined sections were slack.
