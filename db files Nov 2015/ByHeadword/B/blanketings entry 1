Quote:  While on an official visit to the Thames Goldfield I ...[observed] the ... effect of Cyanide of Potassium, in preventing the flouring of mercury used in working the blanketings. These blanketings I found have ... a decidedly acid reaction, due ... to the presence of ferric and ferrous salts ..., and it is to the former ... that what is commonly known as [335] `flouring,' is mainly due, in the process cited above; such ferric salts being able to either oxidize or chloridize the surface of any mercury ..., thus enfilming it with a compound, which being practically insoluble in water ... prevents that metallic contact taking place between detached mercurial globules, which is necessary to amalgamation.

Quote:  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.
