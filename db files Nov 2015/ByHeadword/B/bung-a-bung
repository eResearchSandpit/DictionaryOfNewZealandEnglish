Notes: Philip Temple e-mailed on 2/7/2000 that "On 12 March 1843 in Nelson, Te Rangihaeata told Arthur Wakefield that he would 'bung-a-bung' him if he went to the Wairau... In the DNZE p. 103 you deal with the word 'bung' which can mean become useless, broken, ruined and 'bung out' meaning to die. But your earliest reference for these words is 1887 and the origin is given as Australian pidgin. I wonder what the earliest Australian reference is and whether Rangihaeata would have picked it up from this source so early. It seems that if he was using it, then it already had some currency in NZ by then." Harry Orsman replied that "I think (and I can recall this from the limits of an imperfect memory) that this use in early Maori-Pakeha New Zealand relations was a pidgin word from 'bang(a)bang' meaning to shoot. It wasn't related to the Aboriginal word usually spelled 'bung' 'dead', etc."
