Quote:  BULRUSH-POLLEN CAKES (PUNGAPUNGA OR KONEHU RAUPO) ... Next the flowerheads of the raupo were placed in finely-woven flax baskets and shaken over the mouths of the bags so that only the fine seed was collected. This pollen was put into smaller baskets and covered with rangiora leaves and baked in the umu until steam burst from the top, when the cakes would be cooked.
