Quote:  However, the balloon is down for both stocks. In the days before modern communications at the races, a balloon signalled that the tote was open. When it went up it was a sign that the tote was closed and the horses were ready to race. And as very punter knew, when the balloon fell your money remained at risk until the race ended and the winner was declared.
