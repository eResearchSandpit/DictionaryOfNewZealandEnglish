Quote:  I take a good deal more notice of the Bank of New Zealand than I do of the other banking institutions. It is for the reasons that it is our own national establishment, and every man, woman, and child, is interested in its welfare and affected by its management. Virtually, it belongs to the public; the shareholders, nominally the proprietors, are merely trustees. My view may be extreme on this point but I believe the day is not far distant when the people of New Zealand will take possession of that bank in their own name, and tax all the others out of the country - a protection policy that would pay well.
