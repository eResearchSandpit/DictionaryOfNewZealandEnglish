Quote:  <i>Bitch</i>.-(1) Spoil or botch; (2) pour out tea. I thought these were colonial expressions, if ever there were any; but an erudite friend points out that (1) is used by Surtees in chapter XLII of `Handley Cross,' perhaps the most English book ever written, and that (2) is an old Cambridge University expression quoted in Gradus ad Cantabrigiam - a dictionary of Cambridge expressions, published in 1824. Let us hope that Samuel Butler introduced it to Canterbury.
