Quote:  Emerging originally from children's slang to bulk quite considerably in a grown-up world is the serviceable term <i>bot</i>. Its origin seems to be medical, since in early uses <i>bot</i> is rendered as a germ, doubtless from bot-fly. [52] From this comes the phrase of greeting, <i>How are the bots biting?</i> By the 1920s a <i>bot</i> is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun <i>bot</i> was translated to a verb, and as a result we have <i>to bot,</i> to borrow money, to impose on others, and <i>botting</i>, the practice. <i>To bot on</i> a person is widely used. An interesting extension to the term is to be found in Australia, in which country<i> to bite</i> is often the equivalent for <i>bot</i>. On the other hand <i>cold botting</i> is a straight-out request for food at house-doors. ... Of fairly recent development in New Zealand is the phrase<i> to have the bot</i>, to be sick or out of sorts, moody or disagreeable.
