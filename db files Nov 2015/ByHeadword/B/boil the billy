Quote:  One day, a resident of the Mackenzie Country, when travelling in a dray on the Braemar Road, overtook a young swagger. `Throw your swag up, and get in,' he remarked, `and we'll boil the billy soon.' But this young Englishman, a stranger to New Zealand and its ways, not knowing what `boiling the billy' meant and mistrustful of his friend's rather wild and unshaven appearance, refused the kind offer and decided to push on.

Quote:  This boundary was always debatable ground - it was always imperatively necessary that claims should be `pegged out', and this rule was of necessity `more honoured in the breach than in the observance.' Pegs were not to be had, unless imported, and when introduced stood a great chance of helping to boil the neighbour's `billy'.'

Quote:  Before the real Australian guides you out of the bush, he will probably halt at some place where there is water and say, `How about boiling the billy?' In saying that he is not asking you for a cigarette, a pipe of tobacco, a chew of gum. ... He is simply extending to you the original and (I hope) the everlasting hospitality of all Australia; he is suggesting that he make a brew of tea.
