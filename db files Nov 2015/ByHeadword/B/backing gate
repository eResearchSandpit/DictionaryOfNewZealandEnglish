Quote:  The backing gate is used to bring cows from the yard into the dairy. Its main purpose is to keep stock near the milking area. As each cow is taken in to be milked, another fills up the space it has left and there are no delays in milking. The gate is controlled by the milker, who can bring in the next cows without having to leave those already being milked.
