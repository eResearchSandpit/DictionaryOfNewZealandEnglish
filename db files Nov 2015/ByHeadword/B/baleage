Notes: Jim Cameron writes:  Known and used in rural NZ for 10+ years... Neither baleage (also <i>balage</i>) nor haylage is in the OED or any other dictionary available to me. They may be of distinctive NZ (and Aus?) E - but possibly of US origin - along with hay buggy (presumably proprietary) and bale buggy.  * Google search 11/2006: Bothe spelling used equally in NZ, balage used most in USA.
