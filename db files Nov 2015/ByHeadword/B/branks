Quote:  Mr. Andrew Liddell, who lived to be over a hundred, and who was a bullock-driver from the age of sixteen until he was twenty-two, had much to tell me of this adventurous portion of his long career, ... `You ask how the bullocks were attached to the vehicle, and as bullock-driving is now a lost art, I had better try and explain ... Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start,
`Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour.
