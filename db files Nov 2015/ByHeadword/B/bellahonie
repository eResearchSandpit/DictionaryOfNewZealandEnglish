Quote:  In a few tagging games the players joined hands with the He when they were caught and helped him catch the other players. These games were known as <i>The Bellahonie </i>(E-21) (Wellington, 1910), Kick Post One (Hampden, Otago, 1880), and Ballyhooley (Wellington, 1920). More popular were those games in which the players helped one another to fight the He, and of these the most widespread was the game known as <i>Kick the Tin</i> (e-3), Kick the Boot, Kick the Block, or Homiacky. In this game the He was put on guard of a jam tin placed inside a small circle marked on the ground. [Other players hid: those He could see he named and tapped the tin three times and `captured': other hiders waited till they had chance to kick tin out of circle: then all were free again.]
