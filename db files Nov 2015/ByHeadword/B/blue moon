Quote:  Incidentally, it was Johannes Anderson (1924) writing in the <i>New Zealand School Journal</i> about a specimen of this butterfly which had been caught in Westland, who gave it our common name, saying `I have called it the `blue moon butterfly' because it is so rare; it is found only `once in a blue moon'. Besides it carries the blue moon on its wings, and it is like other blue moons - it is there all the time, but it is only when you are in certain positions that you see it.' The name has stuck and is certainly appropriate. The butterfly is known as the `common eggfly' in Australia.
