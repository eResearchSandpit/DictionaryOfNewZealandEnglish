Quote:  When the mater returned to Dunedin after her holidays in this city, I determined to try "baching," and after having been six months in my crib at the top of the hill, I am more than ever resolved not to descend again to town level... My "bach" is perched.. about 7000ft above sea-level.

Quote:  The bach, these days, tends to be the name given to any smallish holiday house by the beach, no matter how sophisticated. But, in the past, it meant a small home, built by the owner - away out on the edge - by sea or river. Usually it was occupied for just a few summer weeks each year... The great building boom for the archetypal bach was after World War I, with another boom of more gentrified, less interesting baches after World War II.

Quote:  I've never set foot inside a bach. If it was a common experience - the new coat of paint on the windowsill, the towels hung over the front porch to dry, the tattered books - then I have only known it as a myth, as a New Zealand that existed as an advertisement of itself.

Quote:  ..the bach: a simple, no-frills retreat where we can rediscover our conection with nature ... The architect-designed technology-filled modern bach is a refuge not from the city but the wilderness that surrounds it.

Quote:  All six share similar design features, if that is what you call the elements comprising a traditional bach. Low-pitched roofs, corrugated iron walls and recycled timber fascias are standard construction. Some have tiny gardens of hardy coprosma, flax and ice plants scratched out of the rocks. Each has a water tank, various structures to hold firewood and fishing gear, some have a boat shed or a TV aerial and each has a chimney or flue of some kind.
