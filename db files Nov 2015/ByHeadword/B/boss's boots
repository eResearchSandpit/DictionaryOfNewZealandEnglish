Quote:  <i>Boss's boots</i>. Whenever the boss is sighted the shearers pass on the phrase `boss's boots' or `boots on the board' as a warning. Not only was the boss the only person in the shed to wear boots, but from the doubled-up position of the blade shearer working over a sheep, the boss's boots were the first thing he saw.

Quote:  Yet I believe that if a shearer does continually cut sheep in these places he shears less in a day, as he is mentally conscious of his shearing, looking for the `boss's boots.'<i>Ibid.</i> 155  BOSS'S BOOTS. This means what it says: it is the footwear a shearer watches out for.
