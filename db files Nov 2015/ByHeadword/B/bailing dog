Quote:  Now this is where I made a big mistake. Mine were holding dogs and, when asking Tony whether his dogs would help I was thinking along the lines of holding something like an ear, a leg, or a snout. Tony, however, had only bailing dogs with him; his catching dog, Rock, was tied up at the cowshed and in saying, "Oh sure", he was meaning his dogs would dive down and keep the mob bailed up.
