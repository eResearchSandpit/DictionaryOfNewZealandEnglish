Quote:  Genetics providers used a figure called breeding worth to calculate benefits of genetics in dollar terms. BW is Breeding Worth, or worth for breeding, and is expressed in dollars. So a bull at 130 BW compared with another at 120 BW has $5/year/offspring more value for breeding, as only half is passed on from the bull.
