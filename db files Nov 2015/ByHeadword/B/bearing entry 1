Quote:  Another reason for the losses was a rise in bearings - prolapsed vaginas - in ewes that were carrying more than one lamb. As the ewe died so did the lambs. "Bearings are a mystery to us, we don't know why they vary from farm to farm and from year to year, but whatever it is that sets those up, they're set up this year over quite a big area"....
