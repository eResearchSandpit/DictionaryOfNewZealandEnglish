Quote:  But we got through, though one man had bad luck bluffing twenty sheep. They all ran out on to a rocky ledge, and we could see that to go near them meant that they would follow each other - like sheep - over the edge. .h;.us; [cf. OED2a. 1 b. Of a shore or coast-line: `Presenting a bold and almost perpendicular front, rather rounded than cliffy in outline.' 1658.]
