Quote:  The Lyttelton waterfront has been working under the bureau system of engaging labour for nine years now. ... `And,' the bureau manager said, `the men wouldn't like to go back to the old way again.' Under the old system, foremen of the various shipping companies stood on a small platform or block with the men awaiting employment before them and nominated those they required to work their own ships. The trouble with this `auction block' system, as it was called, was that each company tended to give preference to a certain group of men. It engaged the same men first all the time and employed others only when the preferred group were all at work. This meant very often the available work on the waterfront was not evenly shared; and that's what the bureau system tries to avoid.
