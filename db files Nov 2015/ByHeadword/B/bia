Quote:  Some architects argue that the Building Industry Authority (BIA), whose job is it to frame the new regulations, has so narrowly defined some performances that it amounts to prescription by another name... The BIA has also issued an edict requiring any new sanitary fitting.. to have fitted a valve that limits the temperature of the hot water coming out to 55 degrees C.
