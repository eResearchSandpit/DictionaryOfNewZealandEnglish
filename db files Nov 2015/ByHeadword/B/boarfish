Quote:  Family HISTIOPTERIDAE. The histiopterids ... supposed to be a delicacy, are rare, In the common boarfish, <i>Paristiopterus</i>(not really common, but perhaps less rare than other kinds), the sexes are markedly different. The long-finned boarfish (<i>Zanclisteus</i>) rather resembles the tropical angel fish of aquariums; very rare indeed is the Nelson boarfish, <i>Griffinetta nelsonensis</i>, collected once from its nameplace, and once from the Chathams.
