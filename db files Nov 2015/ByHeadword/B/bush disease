Quote:  "Bush" Disease. This affliction appears to be due rather to innutrition [sic] than to any disease, and is apparently confined to the Rotorua district. The animals seem to pine away, but if removed to other and older pastures they usually recover.

Quote:  [Hdg] "Tauranga" or "Bush Disease". This peculiar wasting disease, which is confined to the tract of land lying in the vicinity of Tauranga, and extending from there to Rotorua and Lichfield, was made the subject of an investigation by Mr. Park three years ago... It appears that both sheep and cattle will do well and put on condition for the first few months after being placed on this diseased country, but as time goes on a gradual wasting sets in, which ends in death if they are not removed to another district.

Quote:  All the evidence gathered points to the condition being one of malnutrition rather than of disease, properly speaking, and I have therefore adopted the term 'bush sickness' in connection with it, instead of 'bush disease' as heretofore.
