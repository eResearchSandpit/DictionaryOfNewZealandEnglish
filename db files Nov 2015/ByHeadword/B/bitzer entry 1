Quote:  A snow vehicle with a difference made its appearance at Scott Base early this month. It has been called a "sno-traveller". More correctly it is an Antarctic "bitzer," for it has been made from items salvaged from an old Tucker snocat, a crashed helicopter, various foreign snow vehicles, and locally-manufactured parts... The "bitzer's" steering sysrtem is believed to be novel.
