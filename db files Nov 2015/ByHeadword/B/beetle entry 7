Quote:  A universal animal play in the North Island, but known also in the South Island, was a game variously termed Butcher Bats, Butcher Boys, or Penny Doctor Beetles. In this game, straws suitably moistened at the end with spittle were placed down insect holes and flicked out when the insect bit the end of the straw. The player won who could flick a beetle up first.
