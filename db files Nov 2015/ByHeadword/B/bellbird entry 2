The Saddle back, is a brown bird with a bright red spot on its back like a saddle, these two last species, are about the size of a thrush. There are green parroquets, large hawks, and several kinds of wild ducks, besides Emus, greenbirds and woodhens, which are birds of excellent flavour. [ed. fn: The linnet, brown creeper (Finschia novaeseelandiae>), was occasionally called brown linnet in the earlier days; ... `parroquets', probably the red-crowned parrakeet ...]
