Quote:  The road [to Wakatip was] fairly good - for a "bush" road. The name must be taken in a colonial sense. There was hardly a tree to be seen throughout the journey but the word has made its way over from Australia, and the traveller when he is out of town is in the bush. A country road which is merely formed and not metalled is a bush road, though it pass across an open plain, or up a treeless valley.
