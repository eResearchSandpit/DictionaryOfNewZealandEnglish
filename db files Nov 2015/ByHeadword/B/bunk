Quote:  It is Sunday. We rose later than usual. There are five men sleeping in the hut. I sleep in a bunk on one side of the fire, Mr. Haast ... sleeps upon the opposite one; my bullock-driver and hut-keeper have two bunks at the far end of the hut, along the wall; ... The usual mutton and bread for breakfast with a pudding made of flour and water baked in the camp-oven after a joint of meat - Yorkshire pudding, but without eggs. While we were at breakfast, a robin perched on the table and sat there a good while pecking at the sugar.
