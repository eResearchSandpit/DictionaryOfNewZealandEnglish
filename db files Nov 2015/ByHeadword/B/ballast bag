Quote:  At the Auckland Islands in 1864 Captain Thomas Musgrave noticed female sealions disgorging small pebbles which he thought must have been picked up inadvertently while catching fish on the sea floor. ... The practical sealers believed that the stones served to adjust the buoyancy of the animals and referred to the stone-filled stomach of the fur seal as the `ballast bag'.
