Quote:  The Golden Bauble Award. Winston Peters wins this one from United Future leader Peter Dunne by a country mile, not only because he was cynical enough to grab the baubles of ministerial office with both hands even after telling his supporters he had no interest in the said perks, but because of his brashness in claiming it was all a media beat-up.

Quote:  Before Winston said he "would not accept the baubles of office", the word referred to showy trinkets or trifles. Now it has been redefined to mean large powerful positions much greater than either warranted or deserved and the trinkets now refers to junkets of the first class travelling variety.

Quote:  Is it for enjoying the baubles of office when he wasn't even elected in Tauranga, or is it simply because he's sold his soul to the Prime Minister Helen Clark to win a ministerial salary?

Quote:  Peters knew he was on trial, and defendants shouldn't grin.   A smile might suggest he was enjoying the baubles of office.
