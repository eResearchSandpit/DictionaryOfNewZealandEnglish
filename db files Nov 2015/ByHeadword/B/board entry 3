Quote:  <i>Board, Education</i>-New Zealand State Schools are administered by one or other of ten Education Boards, who make teaching appointments for all schools in their respective areas. Teachers are graded following inspection visits, and according to the Inspector's assessment, are given `grading marks'. In applying for a position, a teacher quotes his mark, the vacancy being filled by the highest graded applicant. Local parents elect School Committees bi-annually. Committee has no say in curriculum, etc., but is, in effect, a caretaking body.
