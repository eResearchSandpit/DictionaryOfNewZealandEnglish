Quote:  Blue vein belongs to that family of cheeses which in England is called stilton, in France roquefort, in Italy gorgonzola, and in Denmark Danish blue. New Zealand blue vein is recognised as a blue cheese in its own right and can be distinguished from its Continental counterparts by the deeper yellow colour of its curd. This arises from a difference in milk colour.
