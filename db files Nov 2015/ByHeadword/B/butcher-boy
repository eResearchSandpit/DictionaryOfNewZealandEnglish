Quote:  Catching butcher-boys was good fun ... You chose a piece of footpath where there was no tar-sealing and looked for little round holes in the earth. When you found a hole, you pushed the soft end of a grass stalk into it ... As soon as it moved you pulled it out and caught a small white grub clinging to the end with its nippers.

Quote:  As a young child I would play around the sturdy old house and among the trees and in the small creek below, or sit on the veranda playing with my dolls or with pieces of grass, fish for butcher boys in the holes in the clay path.
