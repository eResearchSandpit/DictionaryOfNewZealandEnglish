Quote:  Four of us have a mousy brown hair colouring, but I have one sister who had beautiful titian red hair. Once I became interested in genetics I began to wonder how `Ginger' had turned up. My mother was a very dignified English schoolmistress and I certainly could not suspect that she had `boxed out of the ring'.
