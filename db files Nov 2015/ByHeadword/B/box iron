Notes: As I remember them, not always as OED2 `with cavity for hot coals in them', but mainly squat shape with sides taller (or the iron deeper) than the ordinary flat-iron, and often `double ended' rather than triangular, and differing from a flat-iron in having detachable handles. (HWO)

Quote:   The first ironing that I remember was done with what we called a `box iron' - steel frame much like the shape of the present-day iron, although rather shorter and deeper.
