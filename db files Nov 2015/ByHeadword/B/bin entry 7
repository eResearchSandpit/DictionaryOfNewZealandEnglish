Quote:   Meanwhile the `pickers up' were busy gathering up the fleeces as they fell from the bereft sheep and carrying them to the sorting table, where they [173] were stripped of the `pieces', which were thrown aside, while the best of the fleece was quickly classified, rolled together, and deposited in a kind of bin, according to its quality, whether `clothing' or `combing.'

Quote:  At the main entrance of the shearing-shed, which is a long building with pens down the centre, and an outlet at each end, stands a wool-press, and behind this are the bins into which the fleeces, after having been classed, are placed preparatory to being pressed. <i>Ibid.</i>

244 Meanwhile the shorn fleeces are carried to a large table in the wool-shed by a man appropriately named `Fleecy', and are spread out by four wool-pickers, who tear away the bad parts and fold the fleeces square, passing them to the classer, who, in turn, after a rapid examination hands them on to his attendant, and he places them in their respective bins according to their quality.
