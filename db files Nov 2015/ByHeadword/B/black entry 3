Quote:  A further charge, which Murray admitted, was of robbing Ariki Akamoeau of a transistor radio valued at $25. ... Sergeant Mowatt-Wilson said Murray was in a car with other youths when they saw four schoolboys walking along the footpath. Murray is reported to have said: `I'm going to get a black tonight.' He then asked for the radio from one of the boys who, in fear of his safety, gave it to Murray. Returning to the car, Murray said: `Look what I've got - I didn't even have to beat him up for it.'
