Quote:  Before you're unlocked you put some things in a small linen bag. A knife, some bread ... and a small bottle containing syrup or, if you've been lucky, Borstal honey - which is a mixture of syrup and animal fat pinched from the cookhouse. It's a pretty foul mixture, but it replaces butter, which is always short in gaol.
Notes:  (Hamilton)
