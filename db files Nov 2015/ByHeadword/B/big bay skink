Quote:  Results from genetic work show all Big Bay skinks collected belong to a new species within the <i>Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</i> complex . . . The exotic weed <i>Ulex europaeus</i> (gorse) encroaching on to stable cobble fields is likely to be the most immediate threat to Big Bay skinks, and gorse control should continue in order to keep cobble habitat clear.

Quote:  The two skinks known from the Area [sic] are the Open Bay Island skink and the 'Big Bay Skink', the latter being locally common in cobble strands in northern Fiordland and at Barn Bay, and possibly the skin[k] species that is relatively abundant in the rocky areas on the Cascade Plateau ... A brown striped skink of unknown affinity has been found in sphagnum swamp at Okuru.

Quote:  There was no support for the Big Bay skink (BBS1, BBS2, BBS17) being genetically distinct from O. inconspicuum (Fig. 3). The level of genetic divergence between the two subspecies of O. nigriplantare is 7.6%.
