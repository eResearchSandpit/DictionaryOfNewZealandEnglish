Quote:  Another New Zealand expression is `Up the Bouai' (pronounced boo-eye). There was a place near Auckland city which many years ago was somewhat isolated, and it was called the Bouai. The word is not Maori, for there is no `b' and no `h' sound in the original Maori tongue. Once more I cannot tell you where the word came from, but to go `up the Bouai' has become fairly general in use. Today, if a person comes to town from any lonely place in the forests or mountains, and a friend asks him where he has been, most likely the answer will be, `Oh, I've been up the Bouai.' It is a general word for an isolated region.
