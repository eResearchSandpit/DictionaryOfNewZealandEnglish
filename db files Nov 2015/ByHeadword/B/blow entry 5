Quote:  [Colonialisms] To <i>`blow</i>' is, in the colonies, to brag or boast; this is graphic if not elegant; but one of the most curious expressions, based on an entirely errroneous derivation, is `an old identity', used for a person long `identified with a place' - in fact an old inhabitant, or one whose interests have long been bound up in it. This expression is unfortunately now universal even in newspapers.
