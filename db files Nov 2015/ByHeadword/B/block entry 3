Quote:  A few years ago I travelled to Britain via Australia and on the boat an Englishman was telling me that while in Australia he bought a block of land and built his own house. To me the word block suggested a large piece of land, so with visions of Sid Kidman I asked him how big. He replied, `Oh, just fifth of an acre,' I said that in NZ we would call that a section. An American put in that in his country a section was a square mile and the word was used with that meaning in parts of Australia, but in the States they used the word `lot' to describe a building block. I replied that in NZ building blocks were the piles that a house stood on and the Englishman said that in Australia they called them stumps.
