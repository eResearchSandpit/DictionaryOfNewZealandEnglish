Quote:  In the version [of Mother Mother the Pot Boils Over] played at Waikari, Dunedin, in 1920, a blackman comes to the door and says: `I want a match.' `Spit on the floor and take one,' says the maid. The blackman takes one of the children, whereupon the maid shouts, `Mother, Mother, the pot's boiling over.'
