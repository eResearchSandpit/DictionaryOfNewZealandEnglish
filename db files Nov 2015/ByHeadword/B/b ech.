Quote:  He is really getting on my nerves as he natters on and on, a lot of nonsense about getting out of B Ech and back into the sharp end with the boys. Plenty of room at the other end of the paddock. A bunch of D-Day Dodgers and if they're going to hang around in their own half ... they might as well ... have a brew-up.
