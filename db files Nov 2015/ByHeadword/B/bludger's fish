Quote:  MEGRIM ... Sometimes called Lantern-fish (because a lantern could be easily shone through it) and known to the Maoris as `mahue' - the fish that is left behind. Known to Christchurch fishermen in early years as the Bludger's Fish. It was the fish they handed out to well-known bludgers who came down to the docks to cadge fish.
