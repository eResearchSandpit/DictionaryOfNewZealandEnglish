Notes: J Boon (jboon@unitec.ac.nz) suggests this comes from the phrase "bolt from the blue". Trish Ryan (dentrish@clear.net.nz) says it comes from "infamous horse betting circles. Back before the days of judicial videos, race results were sometimes 'pre-arranged'. The backed horse would be given the perfect run in behind a nominated pacemaker. Other horses would be ridden into deadend passages or taken wide in the run home. Occasionally an uncooperative pacemaking horse would 'bolt' on its jockey and win the race - and lose large betting plunges that had been made on the intended victor." >Google search showed in used in Australia also and to a lesser degree also UK, the Netherlands.

Quote:  All Blacks coach Graham Henry picks two bolters for next month's norhtern hemisphere tour, but his sights are set on the 2007 World Cup. ... When the net was dragged yesterday it contained at least two old-fashioned bolters in Taranaki lock Jason Eaton and Auckland's Isaia Toeva, neither of whom have played in the Super 12. ... Bolters are rare in the modern era but the selection of Taranaki lock Jason Eaton and Auckland utility back Isaia Toeava caught them and just about everyone else by surprise.

Quote:  Tracie Palmer of Christchurch raises the matter of the word <i>bolter</i> applied to a rugby player.... She was watching the televised announcement of the national team when one commentator turned to the other and said, "Leon McDonald's a <i>bolter</i>. The reply was, "Yes, he's a <i>bolter</i>"... If she [was interested in racing], she would have heard the term <i>bolter</i> applied to any horse that wins unexpectedly. It's really a synonym for <i>outsider</i>. Horses are half-witted, and can <i>bolt</i> at any time.
