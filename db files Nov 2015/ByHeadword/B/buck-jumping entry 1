Quote:  BUCKJUMPING [title] ... August 23, 1856. I mounted my good mare `Lassie,' with the intention of leading the two packed horses, when to my astonishment her ladyship started buckjumping, and after a long fight, finding she could not throw me, suddenly stood on her hind legs and fell over backwards. ... Buckjumping is a horrid vice, although it is a very amusing performance - to the spectator. The horse tries to roll itself up into a ball, with all four feet close together, head down as near the ground as possible between the forelegs, tail well down, back stuck up like the hump of a camel when in good condition. Attitude is everything. Then commences the performance. With an active spring and rather a forward motion up you go in the air, and down again with a jerk, then up and down like an india-rubber ball, occasionally varying the action by jumping forward and kicking out behind with both legs at once, returning to the oval position as rapidly as possible, then turning round like a teetotum at
lightning speed.

Quote:  Buck-jumping is, I believe, an art only known by the colonial horses at the Antipodes. I imagine it is generally caused by the horse being broken in too quickly, and backed too soon.
