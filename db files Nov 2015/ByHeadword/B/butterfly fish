Quote:  <i>Butterfly-fish</i>, ... New Zealand sea-fish, <i>Gasterochisma melampus</i>, Richards, one of the <i>Nomeidae</i>. The ventral fins are exceedingly broad and long, and can be completely concealed in a fold of the abdomen. The New Zealand fish is so named from these fins; the European <i>Butterfly-fish, Blennius ocellaris</i>, derives its name from the spots on its dorsal fin, like the eyes in a peacock's tail or butterfly's wing.
