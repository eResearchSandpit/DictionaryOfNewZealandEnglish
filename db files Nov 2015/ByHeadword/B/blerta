Quote:  According to the afficionados of New Zealand's musical history, Blerta stands for Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition.  For most New Zealanders over 50, however, Blerta is best remembered as a colourful troupe of artists, anarchists and musicians who travelled the highways and byways of New Zealand in a vivdly decorated omnibus of indeterminate age and intermittent reliability. ... Religious allusions aside, Blerta's over-riding message was fun.

"It's possible to trace the beginings of the New Zealand film industry from Blerta," says Murphy, whose documentary <i>Blerta Revisited</i>, features in the naton's film festivbals this month... Blerta began in October, 1971, when Bruno was 30 years old and restless as a bear stung by a swarm of bees... Blerta was an acronym for Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition... "Blurter" was also a rude term for genitals in '70s slang.

Quote:  Dropping out was in then, and so was Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition. The family hooked up with the heady Blerta roadshow for a while, and seven-year-old Karl was one of many kids with happy memories of racing on stage during performances.
