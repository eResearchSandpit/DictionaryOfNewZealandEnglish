Quote:  Until the crop is bulked down under good conditions, it will demand constant attention. As soon as the requisite condition is obtained the leaf should be stripped from the stalks, graded, tied into hands and bulked down .. a room for bulking down should be thoroughly dry, clean, warm and not subject to sudden changes of temperature.
