Notes: (Griffiths Collection has following from 62 of H.J. Anderson) He went over to his hut and came [sic: something missing: check] burr somewhat larger than a soccer ball. A burr is a form of external growth found on beech trees. It is generally attached to the trunk of the tree by a very small connecting branch and can usually be removed from the fallen tree quite easily. In appearance it is something like a pumpkin, covered over with round knobs of bark about as big as marbles.]
