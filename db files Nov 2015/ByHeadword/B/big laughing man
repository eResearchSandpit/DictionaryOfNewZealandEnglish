Quote:  [I] concluded that what I'd found was the species <i>Gymnopilus spectabilis</i>, commonly known as big laughing gym. Eating this mushroom gives whole new meaning to the expression, " I nearly died laughing". That is literally what can happen. The victim goes into fits of uncontrollable laughter (perhaps because of the mushroom's psilocybin content), but also experiences nausea, abdominal pain, convulsions or death.
