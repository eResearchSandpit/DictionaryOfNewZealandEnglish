Quote:  `The working class can kiss my arse, I've got a bludger's job at last,' sang Smithy to the tune of the Red Flag ... `All the boys sing it whenever they pass Bludger's Hill. ... Makes the base-wallahs mad.' ... `Almost makes a man want to be a base walloper. ... A nice quiet life. Nothing to do except get up in the morning and get the shaving water, make the bed, polish some buttons to keep away from parade, queue for a feed, siesta, tea, a beer at the Naafi in the evening, a game of two-up and so to bed'.
