Quote:  The custom of tattooing is now falling out of fashion amongst the rising generation of both sexes, and it is to be hoped that before many years have passed, the nickname of `Blue-lips' will no longer be applicable to the native girls of New Zealand. Where the tattooing is confined to the slender lyre-shaped line on the fair one's chin, the effect is really not unpleasing; but the tattooed lip is an abomination.

Quote:  For the young women this ornamentation [moko] was limited to the lips, and the name `blue-lips' was given to them by the English. Red lips were looked upon as a reproach or disfigurement.
