Quote:  <i> [Notho]fagus fusca</i>,Hook. f. ... Tooth-leaved Beech. Black Birch of Auckland and in part of Otago and Southland. Black or Bull Birch of Lake Wakatipu. Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.
