Notes: Miss Betty Perkins (Middle Run, Main Rd, Paekakariki) writes on  19/09/1999 that her father was a (legal) Queensland outback bookie and used the full phrase "not a bolter's chance on a greasy track" which he said came from outback country horse meetings when the race was started by the drop of a rope. If a horse bolted on a greasy track and won, the win would be most unexpected.
