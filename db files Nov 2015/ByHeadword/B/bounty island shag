Quote:  Captain Bollons has presented to Canterbury Museum a specimen of the Bounty Island shag, Phalacrocorax ranfurlyi, which he obtained on his recent trip to the southern island in the Hinemoa. .. The Bounty Island shag was named after Lord Ranfurly, and it is the last bird added to the list of birds of New Zealand, which, for all practical purposes, is now complete and closed.
