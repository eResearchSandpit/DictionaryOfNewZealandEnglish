Quote:  Boat Nigger [heading] Most weekdays on P Marina at Westhaven you'll see a pretty young woman with a vacuum hose round her neck, ... She's a `boat nigger'. At least that's what her job is called by the boating fraternity. Aquatic charlady might be more appropriate in these times. Jules cleans boats.
