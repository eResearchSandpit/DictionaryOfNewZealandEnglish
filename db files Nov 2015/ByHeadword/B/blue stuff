Quote:  A sample of Blue Stufff analysed at harness racing's drug laboratory in Auckland had been found to contain a broncho-dilator not previously detected here.... Rennell said HRNZ was already conducting its own probe into Blue Stuff, when it became apparent their investigations were crossing the paths of local police.

Quote:  While Harness Racing NZ chases round the country looking for the ridiculously named Blue Stuff, four trainers named have been tarnished with the unsaid "druggie" label... The substance is not illegal under New Zealand law but is believed to be performance-enhancing in horses and therefore banned in racing.... So armed with all this, some bright spark in Australia has decided to call it Blue Stuff - not HorsePower or Super Horse, or even methoxyxchlororidepanoprophren.You can imagine the confusion when there's a pre-dawn bang on the door and the coppers are yelling through the letterbox: "We're looking for illegal Blue Stuff."
