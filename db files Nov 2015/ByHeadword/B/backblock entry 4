Quote:  To facilitate the working of the station, there were three places where the hands resided. The Homestead, ... the chief one, was at the end of the station nearest civilisation. About eight miles further back was a cottage, known as the `Out-Station' ... [Further back] the Ruahine whare ... This whare was therefore the furthest back habitation ... It was erected for the accommodation of shepherds when mustering the back-blocks.
