Quote:  [Hdg] Kiwi bagmen not too down and out. Journalists reporting on the National Party leadership scuffle swooped on the oddly Kiwi word "bagmen" to refer to the candidates' chief lobbyists in caucus... Elsewhere a bagman can be lot of things, all pretty well removed from getting in the vote for Bill or Don. In Oz it's an alternative to swagman.  Elsewhere, it is a commercial traveller. Elsewhere again, and more sinisterly, it is one who collects racketeers' money. In a list of Post Office workers, it appears with porters. The <i>New Oxford Dictionary of New Zealand English</i> reckons it's a man who helps fill sacks of grain. The nearest to our special meaning is a Canadian reference to "political fundraiser".
