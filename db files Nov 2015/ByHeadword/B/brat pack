Quote:  Late last year, the other members of English's brat pack - Roger Sowry, Nick Smith and Tony Ryall - began pushing for the removal of Wyatt Creech from the deputy prime ministership... But English, like others in the so-called Shipley "brat pack", is conscious the government can deliver real benefits only if there is longterm growth in the economy.

Quote:  Jenny Shipley's Young Guns - the Brat Pack, as the media rather flatteringly called them - are technically young, as in below 40. That is young in National Party circles.

Quote:  Tony Ryall, the only member of National's "brat pack" not to be made a minister, is settling in for a regime of passive-aggression in his chairmanship of the finance and expenditure committee. <i>Ibid.</i> 34 Socially, English remains bonded to National's erstwhile "brat pack" - himself, Smith, Sowry and Tony Ryall - who once presented themselves as an update of Labour's fish'n'chip gang by posing for a publicity short while supposedly plotting at McDonald's.

Quote:  "The brat pack was wetting its nappies," observes one seasoned minister caustically, referring to the quartet of up and coming ministers led by Bill English... Instead, it is the brat pack who, along with Shipley, are intended to be National's energetic, new public face. English in Finance, Nick Smith in Education, Tony Ryall in Justice and Sowry in Social Services are attempting to make the running by a series of announcements in their portfolios.

Quote:  [Bill English] has become angrier and angrier watching Labour campaign against himself and his closest colleagues, in particular the three other (comparatively) young ministers known as the Brat Pack.

Quote:  Whether Shipley's ministerial brat pack succeeds in reshaping the political debate on social policy, National may need an even more powerful circuit-breaker to shift voting sentiment... Who better to turn to than someone who entered Parliament while the brat pack was still in short pants?.. Bratpack minister Tony Ryall picked up the portfolio from McCully in January.

Quote:  But the approach of National's new breed of Ministers - the so called bratpack headed by Mr English and Mr Sowry and including Nick Smith and Tony Ryall - is drowned out by the cacophony of ills that continue to plague the Government.

Quote:  The "brat pack" - a tight-knit group who entered Parliament together in 1990 - are resented by some for the influence they wield and their monopolisation of the senior roles in Parliament.

Quote:  And yet it represents a remarkable triumph for the "brat pack" - a moniker I'm afraid I [<i>sc.</i> Michael Laws] applied to English, Sowry, Tony Ryall and Nick Smith in early 1990 and was soundly slapped down for.

Quote:  National's arch young fogey. Tony Ryall, a member of the party's laughably unhip "brat pack" had just claimed - falsely - that his local hospital was full of dope-crazed maniacs while trying to defend his Prime Minister's ill-judged attack on the Green's marijuana policy

Quote:  Nick Smith's forced resignation as National Party deputy leader marks another step in the decline of the 'bratpack" - the tight-knit group of four young National MPs who entered Parliament together in, or just out of, their twenties, holidayed together and rose through the ranks together. All four were first elected in 1990... Mr English was No 1; his mates Roger Sowry, Nick Smith and Tony Ryall were Nos.2, 3 and 5...But the bratpack - a label advertising guru Kevin Roberts attached to them - is history as a unit. This is an idea the bratpackers themselves have been trying to foster for several years.
