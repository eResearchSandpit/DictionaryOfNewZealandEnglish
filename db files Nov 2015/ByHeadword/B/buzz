Quote:  [Blue is a Mongrel Mob gang member] When he joined gang members used blades but today's weapon was the gun and 14-year-olds were not mature enough for this. `You do not want a 14-year-old boy with a gun in his hand. That is not the buzz,' he said. ... Blue said he thought the mobs' `buzz' was the best it had been for 20 years. `We have our own little buzz. You cannot describe it. It's living life to the hilt.'
