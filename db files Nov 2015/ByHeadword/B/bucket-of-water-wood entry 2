Quote:   `Bucket-of-water-wood', <i>P. tenuifolium</i>, Maori Kowhiwhi or Maupariki - despised as firewood. ...  PITTOSPORUM TENUIFOLIUM (<i>Banks & Sol</i>.) ... This small evergreen tree, known by the native names of `Kowhiwhi' and `Maupariki', abounds on the eastern coasts of both Islands. ... Even as firewood it is despised, and bears the all too suggestive name of `Bucket of Water Wood', so little is it calculated by its combustive qualities to enliven the domestic hearth.
