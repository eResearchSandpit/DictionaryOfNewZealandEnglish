Quote:  <i>Buckley's chance.</i>-A correspondent from Kirwee, the same as explained <i>Jimmy Woodser</i> for me, writes that Buckley was one of the earliest convicts (perhaps the first) to escape from Botany Bay and take to the bush. It was then thought impossible to do this and live, as apart from the problem of food and water, the blacks were numerous and savage and reported to be cannibals. Extensive search was made, but no trace was found of Buckley; and it was concluded that the natives had got him. Any other convict who talked of escaping was invariably told that he would have `Buckley's chance' - hence the saying. However, many years afterwards Buckley was found to be still living. He had managed to make friends with a small band of natives who were moving to a remote part of the country, married one of their gins, and lived their life. The convict system had by that time been abolished, so the Government granted him a free pardon.
