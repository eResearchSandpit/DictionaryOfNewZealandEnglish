Quote:  The wheeled vehicles that transport the coal (trucks, tubs, or skips elsewhere) are in the Strongman called <i>boxes</i>, are linked together in a string they become a <i>race of boxes</i>. This <i>race</i> is the same word you hear in a railwayman's <i>rake of wagons, rake</i> being the northern-dialect form. <i>Race</i> was usually the southern form, used by miners in Cornwall. It looks as if a Cornishman at one time got loose on the West Coast.
