Quote:  <i>bank and bank</i>. A river runs bank and bank when all the streams join into one; i.e., when in high flood (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 73). Hence a banker. The expressions were probably introduced by the shagroons. [Morris Austral English] gives a banker as meaning a river full to the top of its banks. New Zealand rivers, of course, do not get as full as that.
