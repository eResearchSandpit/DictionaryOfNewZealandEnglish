Quote:  <i>Wahlenbergia  gracilis (The Graceful Blue-bell) ... W. albomarginata </i>has larger and more beautiful flowers, and is common in the hilly and sub-alpine districts of both islands. ... [431] <i>W. gracilis</i> is one of the commonest of flowers in dry situations on open plains, and grassy hill-sides. It might be described as the New Zealand blue-bell, except that the application of the term to a flower, which is more often white than blue, is scarcely appropriate.
