Quote:  The creeks [up-country from Raglan c1914-1018] were full of eels, butterfish and crawlies (freshwater crayfish), so we never lacked in a variety of foods. <i>Ibid.</i> 29 While washing was being completed we youngsters would catch butterfish and crawlies in the nearby creek to roast in the hot embers under the boiling clothes.
