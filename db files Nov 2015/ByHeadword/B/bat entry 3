Quote:  Even the metallic ring of the coins could be heard, followed by the suppressed sights of `heads' bettors as `tails' were cried while `two ones', `barred,' `heads a dollar', `tails' ditto, `pass the bat', and other equally quaint and even classic chants, were wafted on the midnight breezes. ... Much to `Truth's' deep regret, for it detests having to give the show away, lately, at Miramar, when some road-making or mountain-razing work has been going on, some of them have engaged in the simple yet sinful process of tossing two bright copper pennies, with a bit of wood, popularly known as `the bat' or `the kip' and, therefore, in the eye of the law are hardened criminals.
