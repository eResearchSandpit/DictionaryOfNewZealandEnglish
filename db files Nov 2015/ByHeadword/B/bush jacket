Notes: An item of army tropical kit similar in cut to the 1970's 'safari' jacket or suit. "I appropriated my father's after the war with its capacious pleated breast pockets, "bellows" hip pockets - in front; belt and epaulets, if that is the name for the shoulder bands which carried rank badges, either by means of eyelet holes or by sliding on a fabric sleeve embroidered with crowns, stars, batons or whatever. It was generally understood that the garment, and its name originated in Africa - but it could have been some other "colonial territory" such as India.
