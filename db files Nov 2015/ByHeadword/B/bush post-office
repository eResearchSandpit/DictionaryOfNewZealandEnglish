Quote:  In the middle of the [Canterbury] plains we drew up alongside a post, on which was nailed what looked like a small writing-desk. The driver leant out, lifted the lid, took out a small leather bag, and drove off. It was a bush post-office - a very private letter-box, belonging to some sheep-station.
