Quote:  Calves not kept for the herd become <i>bobby calves</i>, a truly standard word since it was defined in the <i>Bobby Calf Marketing Regulations</i> in the New Zealand Statutory Regulations, 1938: `Bobby calf' means a calf which is intended for slaughter for human consumption as boneless veal.' The origin and dating of the word are doubtful. There is a similar word poddy calf for a hand-fed calf, recorded in Australia from last century. The present New Zealand meaning seems to have arisen about 1929. The Christchurch Times, 17 August 1929, reported: `During the last year or so quite a trade has grown up in young, or `bobby' calves, which are taken in by the freezing works, killed and exported.' The term <i>vealer</i> is also used.

Quote:  Prior to the season 1927-28, it was customary to kill all surplus calves on the farm, and dispose of their skins only. The trade, which is known locally as `The Bobby Calf' trade, developed during that season, and has extended rapidly each year since. Under this system of disposal, calves are collected by motor lorry and delivered at freezing-works, where they are slaughtered and packed as boneless veal.
