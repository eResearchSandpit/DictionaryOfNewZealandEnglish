Quote:  <i> blind-stabbing</i>: Used by Jack Sweeney, prospector, to describe traditional method of getting gold-bearing wash out of glacial rivers. The prospector is anchored by a rope which is controlled by a mate on the bank. He wheels a wheelbarrow as far into the torrent as is possible, shovels the alluvial wash into it blindly, because the water contains glacial silts and is milky white, and returns to the bank with as much as he can shift. This is processed at leisure for gold
