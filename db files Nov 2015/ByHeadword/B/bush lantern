Quote:  A bush lantern is constructed by placing a candle within the neck of a clear glass bottle, the bottom of which has either been knocked off by a sharp scientific tap from a practised hand, or more artistically removed by pouring in a little cold water, and then thrusting the bottle end-wise in a fire
