Quote:  <i>bullers</i> gumboots, a brandname for a low-top, lace-up variety popular in bush country but often scarcely recognisable by the makers after have been cut down further to lighten them up, had the laces replaced by wire and had holes made in them to let the water drain out. [<i>G. Johnston</i>]
