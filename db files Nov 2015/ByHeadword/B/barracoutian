Quote:  So much did the name [`old identity'] come to be a term of reproach among the Australian diggers that the barracouta, a rather coarse fish, very abundant at certain seasons, and which were consequently very cheap, and a great favourite with boarding-house keepers, was christened by them `the old identity'.]
