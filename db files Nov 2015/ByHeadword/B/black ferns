Quote:  Better or not the officially sanctioned substitute was announced early in August and the Gal Blacks of brief notoriety (along with other canvassed names such as Elle Blacks and She Bs

- after ABs) were finally history. The team was henceforth to be known as the Black Ferns. Here the colour adjective fittingly remains, and the noun echoes the name sported (since the early 1990s) by another black-clad international New Zealand women's team, the netballers or Silver Ferns. Since that title itself derives from the famous fernleaf-cum-national symbol of the All Black jersey (to wear the silver fern is a common variant of to be an All Black), there is an obvious appropriateness in reapplying the fern to the rugby union context. Black Ferns is further legitimised bv the presence in the natural world of a black (tree-) fern, in Maori the mamaku.
