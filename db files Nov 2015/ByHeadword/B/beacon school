Quote:  ...already parents report one of the reasons they are desperate to get into so-called beacon schools is that, with a shortage of quality teachers, it's the big popular schools that are less likely to have problems attracting well-qualified staff... When the child completes its education - paid for by the taxpayers of New Zealand who cannot get their own children into those beacon schools - the family will leave.
