Quote:  Other well-known [drinking] games are Hokonui Swindle, Bottles, Fluffy Ducks, Bunnies are Hovering, Cardinal Huff, All Blacks, Matches, and The Amazing Grimaldi Brothers. All these games involve either a complicated intellectual exercise, tongue twisters, mathematical calculations or aerobatics in a confined space; High Candelabras for example, involves intoxicated individuals attempting to traverse the four walls of a room without touching the floor.
