Quote:   `People bathing in some of our larger lakes sometimes get `bathers' itch', caused by a free-swimming stage of a blood fluke or schistsome. The intermediate host is in this case the native freshwater snail <i>Simlimnea</i> ... The adult blood fluke cannot live in man, so the itch is the only harm done.
