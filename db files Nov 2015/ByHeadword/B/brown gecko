Quote:  NEW ZEALAND is home to two types of geckos, which have generally been described as green (<i>Naultinus</i> genus), and brown (<i>Hoplodctylus</i> genus) geckos. Genetic work may yet reveal the taxonomy to be more complicated than this, as brown gecko species have proved to be unexpectedly diverse.
