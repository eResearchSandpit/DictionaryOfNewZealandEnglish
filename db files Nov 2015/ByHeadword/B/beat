Quote:  beat: (i) that area which a musterer is detailed off to clear. An easy beat is one of the easy walking, usually the bottom or top beat, though the latter may entail a long initial climb. A hard beat is usually one of the middle beats and very often includes bluffs and also much need to run dogs on the blind.
