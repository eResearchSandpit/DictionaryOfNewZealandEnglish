Pronunciation:
Notes: the form develops from an orig. loose combination of <i>bush</i> A1, `forest' and <i>land</i> with a sense (or implication) `land covered with bush', earlier forest-land; 1. land covered with native bush. 2. farmland developed from cleared bushland. [Cf 1835 Yate New Zealand 17-18 The forest-land is peculiarly rich; indeed, were it not so, it would be utterly impossible that the [18] immense vegetation constantly going on should be supported.] to a closer combination or compound with a sense `cleared bush-land, farmland once covered with bush', with the senses often hard to distinguish. (cf fernland]
