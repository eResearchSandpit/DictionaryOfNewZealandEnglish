Pronunciation:
Notes: The Macquarie sense was used by our contractor installing a pool in 1990, and subsequently by us. I have also heard it in relation to public water systems. <i>Backflush</i> is also used in the context of public water systems, with the same meaning. This may be international English but I have no evidence of this. It does not appear in OED(BJC)
