Quote:  About an hour after the second boil up for the day the affected person would feel an unnatural weakness stealing over him, his axe would grow excessively heavy, every blow would be an effort and a feeling of unreality as if working in a dream and a faint tremnbling of the limbs would assail him. Usually he would sit down and sharpen his axe for a minute or two then carry on chopping, the feeling slowly fading away in about half an hour. Among ourselves, to give this affliction an important sounding name, we always called it "Hydrophobia" but it is more generally called "Bushman's staggers," and is supposed to be caused by overworking the stomach at the same time as overworking the muscles.
