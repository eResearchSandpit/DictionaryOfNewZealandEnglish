Quote:  Bush jiggers were the motor-driven creations used to transport humans along bush trams... Small hand-worked jiggers were used extensively on the NZR but they were not common on trams... The first bush jiggers were constructed early in the 20th century... The earliest confirmed jigger appeared in April 1908 when it was reported that a trolley had been built by Gamman at Te Ohu to convey 10-12 men to and from work... The principal use of bush jiggers was to get the bushmen to and from work. Compared to other options they were faster, safer,warmer, and drier. <i>Ibid.</i> 58 The development of the bush jigger spelled the end for most bush camps because they made it possible to travel to work over long distances in comparative speed and comfort.
