Quote:  The <i>department-boss</i> is in charge of the <i>board-walkers </i>often promoted from the ranks, who are in charge of the chain etc.; they vary the speed the speed of the drive on the chain, which is done by a chain hanging down, giving rise to cries `Give it a pull' (i.e., speed it up) or `Pull it back' (slow down). If some are tired and he speeds it up, there are cries of `Get out you whip!' or `Bring your whip tomorrow!'. If the men are very tired to the point of <i>mutton-staggers</i> there will be cries of `Give him a drink of water.', and responses `But he had water yesterday'.

Quote:  I slipped on the bloodied floor and the carcase should have fallen on me, but the wheel jammed somehow on the rail and I crouched under swinging death, sick in the guts. The board-walker had to climb up on the wall and saw through the hind leg.  <i>IBid.</i> 67 The boardwalker came in for men to help with the cleaning up and I said you can stuff that, sport.
