Quote:  <i>Lag</i> is a general term used to refer to a sentence or to an inmate. Examples are <i>big lag</i> (life sentence or preventive detention), a <i>wicked lag</i> (any sentence over seven years, life or preventive detention), and a <i>bed-and-breakfast lag</i> (a very short sentence). To <i>knock your lag out</i> is to serve your time in prison.
