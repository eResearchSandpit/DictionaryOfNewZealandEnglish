Quote:  [The towai] is used for ship-building and is called by Englishmen `black birch.' [Although Morris quotes this under towai, Andersen apparently regards it as <i>N. solandri</i>. It is significant that in his 1848 Handbook of NZ 142, Wakefield replaces the 1845 <i>Towai</i> above with <i>Tawai</i>: thus, `Tawai ... is particularly well adapted for ship-building ... and is commonly called `black birch' by the sailors and other Europeans acquainted with it'.]
