Quote:  Strictly speaking, the term `bed' is applicable only to that part of the valley actually covered by the flowing water. But the cass, like most New Zealand rivers, is continually liable to flood ... In this paper the term `river-bed', following the colloquial usage, is used to include that part of the valley liable to be covered with water in times of severe floods. This `river-bed' is bounded on either side by a broad expanse of flat land, chiefly tussock-covered, termed colloquially `river-flat', but in this paper `terrace'.
