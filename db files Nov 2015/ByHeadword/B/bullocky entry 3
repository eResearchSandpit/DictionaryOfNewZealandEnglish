Quote:  No bullocky ever loved a tui, for the simple reason that these birds are great imitators, and they would often lead these bullockies astray. The bullocky would follow what he thought was the sound of one of his bells, and instead, find a tui up a tree.

Quote:   ~ Man employed to drive bullocks. The old nickname for him was <i>bullocky, bullock-puncher</i> being a much later word. Bullocks on the road have to feed until about 10 a.m., so that bullockies were generally lazy, slow starters in the morning. They were famous for swearing, and the old story of the parson who said, `Even a bullock driver has a soul to be saved' is still told up country. (C.; 1898 Morris Austral-English)
