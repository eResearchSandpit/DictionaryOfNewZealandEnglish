Quote:  Petrol heads, bogans, and gruffs - these names mean one thing to west Auckland comedian Ewen Gilmour : "westies". Gilmour believes westies live all over the country. No matter where they live they share a love of tight black jeans, the smell of burning rubber and the feel of a leather jacket. Being a westie is about lifestyle, not location.

Quote:  A stereotypical bogan or "westie" is a male clad in black jeans and black T-shirt embellished with the name of a heavy metal band. Females of this genus are normally found wearing ill-fitting jeans and lace blouses or velvet dresses and an optional speckled leather jacket.  The bogan car of choice is Holden and the more grunt the better. Fluffy dice are mandatory and not optional. The bogan drink of choice is Lion Red and preferably from a crate. Bogan pastimes usually involve their car and ranged from drag racing down residential streets to peel-out sessions in vacant lots.

Quote:  Bogans as fashion icons? It sounds unlikely, but Massey University design student Genevieve Packer's bogan-inspired fashion collection is ultra-cool... "Bogans are one of New Zealand's last bastions of anti-cool - I wanted to take that and re-interpret it in a fashion context as cool... I think bogans are something we all identify with - they are part of our national identity and we should appreciate them."... Packer's fringed leather cuffs anbd collars are inspired by bogan chicks' tasselled boots. Her line of T-shirts feature popular bogan names like Shazza, Mussa, Gazza and Bazza as well as bogan vehicles like Holdens, Cortinas and Toranas.
