Quote:  Beyond the case of Club 574, they placed particular emphasis on the rights of small owner-operated brothels, or Soobs, and so the obvious joke here is that big owner-operated brothels must henceforth be known as Boobs. Club 574 is a Boob - it contracts 45 sex workers. As for the Soobs, which are typically 2 or 3 women whoring out of private homes throughout the Auckland suburbs, the city council argues they could move into the city, where there are 9500 apartment units or, more to the point, 12,000 bedrooms.
