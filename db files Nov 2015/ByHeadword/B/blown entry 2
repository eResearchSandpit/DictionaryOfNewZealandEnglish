Quote:  When I was able to make an examination I found a nest of maggots from an earlier strike at work under the skin, and am still asking myself what made the second sheep give this rude assistance to the first. For they were not even standing side by side. To reach the blown ewe the other one had to stretch across an intervening back, and she bit so savagely that it was clearly a purposeful assault.
