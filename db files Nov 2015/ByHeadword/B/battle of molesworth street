Quote:  The first sign of the tougher police attitude came days later in Molesworth St, Wellington... The Battle of Molesworth St, as it came to be known, lasted only moments. But it had a traumatic effect on a country accustomed to thinking of the police as an essentially benign law enforcement agency.
