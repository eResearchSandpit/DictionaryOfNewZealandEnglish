Quote:  <i>April</i>, 1861 - It is Sunday. We rose later than usual. There are five men sleeping in the hut. I sleep in a bunk on one side of the fire, Mr. Haast ... sleeps upon the opposite one; my bullock-driver and hut-keeper have two bunks at the far end of the hut, along the wall; ... The usual mutton and bread for breakfast with a pudding made of flour and water baked in the camp-oven after a joint of meat - Yorkshire pudding, but without eggs. While we were at breakfast, a robin perched on the table and sat there a good while pecking at the sugar.

Quote:  <i>Bullock-driver.</i> - Man employed to drive bullocks. The old nickname for him was

<i>bullocky, bullock-puncher</i> being a much later word. Bullocks on the road have to feed until about 10 a.m., so that bullockies were generally lazy, slow starters in the morning. They were famous for swearing, and the old story of the parson who said, `Even a bullock driver has a soul to be saved' is still told up country. (C.; 1898 Morris Austral-English) [c1962 One of the last bullock teams was driven (ceremonially) in Canterbury in 1962.]
