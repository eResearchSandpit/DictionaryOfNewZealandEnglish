Quote:  Baroona is a funny name for a beer... it is associated with seasickness in the minds of many who squatted in its scrawny, diesel-filled guts, while it pitched and rolled its way across the Waitemata in search of Waiheke Island. <i>Baroona</i> was that ferry, now it is the name of Waiheke Island's one and only beer. There was a time when the residents of some Hauraki Gulf slands referred to the need to regurgitate after a bout of over-indulgence as "gotta have a baroona".
