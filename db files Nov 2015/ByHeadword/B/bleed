Quote:  Often in that Autumn, belated lambs that failed to fatten in the earlier drafts, waxed fat. The seed ripened on the ryegrass, and with it came the legacy of `ergot'. Practical sheep men found that this complaint produced `staggers'. Too much blood obtained, although the patient was in splendid condition, used to keep spinning round, and the remedy was the ancient panacea of most diseases in England, centuries ago, and ere science interrupted their outlook, viz. `to bleed' and take from the patient the overflow of red corpuscles.

Quote:  After camping the night there, we had to cross Kerr's Hill which was covered with tutu, a poisonous plant for sheep, and the curse of drovers. ... Odd sheep started to get `tooted' and instead of pushing on the men started bleeding the sheep. This was done by cutting a vein under the eye. It was supposed to help the sheep, although I never thought it did any good.
