Quote:  [<i>Coprosma lucida,</i> Forst.] The `Broad-leaf' or `Orange-leaf' tree of the settler; terms, however, which are probably not only applied to other species of the genus <i>Coprosma, (e.g. C. robusta,</i> Raoul,) but to species of genera belonging to very different families - and especially to <i>Griselinia lucida, (N.O. Corneae,) </i>whose foliage closely resembles that of <i>Coprosma lucida ... C. lucida</i> is also known to the Otago natives as `Kalamou' (Hector); and to the North Island Maoris as `Karamu', [fn] `Kakaramu,' or `Karangu,' [fn] (Colenso.) [fn] Also applied to <i>C. foetidissima. </i>
