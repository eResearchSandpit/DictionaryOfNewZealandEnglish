Quote:  Most of our cities and even small towns have restaurants that offer and wine service and / or allow patrons to bring their own wine. Not many diners know that the BYO concept originated in Australia and New Zealand during the 1960s and 70s and is rarely found elsewhere. The antipodean origin is acknowledged in the authoritative Oxford Companion to Wine.

Quote:  We stopped BYO for larger groups two years ago. All they were interested in doing was bringing in a couple of cases of booze and having a party at our expense... You want BYO, he says, then you go to a restaurant, probably an ethnic restaurant or cafe, where you get good cheap food that doesn't take a great deal of preparation and few staff. That's the sort of restaurant that can afford to do BYO.

Quote:  I don't want to buy into a punch-up over the BYO syndrome, but this tell-tale brown-bag routine is something I shy away from. It's pretty much an Australian and New Zealand thing to ferry our own drinkies into restaurants, sometimes even transporting them in a designer bag, suitably labelled, and drawing attention to the fact that l'il ole me is bringing my own.

Quote:  Inside, on the walls, are black and white photographs of early Plimmerton, and the cafe is one of the last of a species fast facing extinction in central Wellington - the BYO restaurant. Twenty-five years ago, "BYO restaurant" had exciting, avant-garde connotations of a new breed of restauranteur, intent on providing a hip, casual alternative to the handful of stiff, expensive, fully licensed fine dining restaurants which, aspart from hotels and a scattering of tired old steak and chip grill-roomns, previously comprised the sum total of the New Zealand dining-out experience.
