Quote:  The system of work [in the Grey coalfield] is mainly by bord and pillar, a small portion only of this coal having been worked by the longwall method. In the bord-and-pillar system the bords are 18ft. wide, and pillars 14 yards thick. The pillars are left intact until the boundary of a section is reached, when they are worked back. The roof has in [418] main proved good, enabling a large percentage of the pillar-coal to be won.
