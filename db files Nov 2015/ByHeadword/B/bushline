Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:the timber-line; the upper limit of the growth of bush A1 on a mountain; height at which bush ceases to grow (cf. timber-line (OED 1835) is occas. used in N.Z; cf. and cp. snow-line, which is more often used in the SI mountain-country. Whether one uses bush-line or snow-line depends upon the locality of the speaker, or the point of view of the speaker, e.g. a bushman would be more likely to speak of the bush-line, a mountaineer of the snow-line. bush-line and snow-line are only occas. synonymous. e.g. in mountain-country, in the summer, when snow is lying high or has disappeared, the bush-line stands out clearly, but is often called (locally and colloquially) `the snow-line': (cf. also scrub-line).

Quote:  We may speak of kauri forest or beech forest, but we get lost in the bush, fight bush fires, and climb above the bushline. The kauri forest, like the mixed podocarp forest, the sub-tropical rain forest, ... and such-like are terms that come from the botanist and forester, not from the layman - or from the bushman. ... Even those later scientists who use <i>forest</i> as a general rule usually write of <i>bushmen, bush tracks, patches of bush</i>, and the <i>bushline. </i> <i>Ibid.</i> 24 <i>Bushline</i>, the upper limit of the bush, would be the <i>timberline</i> in North America. Hudson [G.V. Hudson 1890 TrNZI 2/181] used it in 1890 as if it were then well established. It does not seem to have been noted in any dictionary and is probably a word indigenous to New Zealand.
