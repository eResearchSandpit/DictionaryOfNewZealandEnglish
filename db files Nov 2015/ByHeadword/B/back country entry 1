Quote:  Backblocks or backcountry: In the South Island that country beyond the river gorges is termed back country, as differing from front country which consists of those hills through whose gorges the same rivers wend their way. Backblocks is the equivalent North Island term though the nature of the rivers does not define them so neatly.
