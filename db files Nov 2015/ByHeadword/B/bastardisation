Quote:  The ill-treatment they endured was called "bastardisation", and there are repeated references to it in a book published six years ago to mark the 50th  anniversary of the Regular Force Cadet School at Waiouru, where,from 1948 to 1991,  about 4000 teenage cadets were inducted and trained to be soldiers... But from his research - questionnaires returned by former cadets and key figures - he says "bastardisation" took many forms.
