Quote:  D[illon] at one time farmed his own land in the Waimea and was in the habit of driving his own bullock cart into Nelson. The bullock is the general and almost only vehicle in this district. It is a two wheeled cart with a pair of bullocks; occasionally we see 4-6 or 8 bullocks yolked [sic] according to circumstances.
