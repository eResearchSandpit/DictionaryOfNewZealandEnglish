Quote:  The larger species [of <i>Aciphylla</i>] are familiar to the settlers as `Spear-grass', or `Bayonette-grass', `Wild' or `Bloody-Spaniard', [<i>bloody</i> =?] in allusion to their very rigid, strong, poniard-like, sharp-pointed leaves ... Hence a `Spear-grass Scrub' on the hill ranges is frequently most formidable ... to men and horses, though it forms one of the favourite hunting grounds of the Wild Pig. In the Matukituki Valley, `Bayonette-grass' forms an undergrowth in a dense scrub of prickly thorn ... [50] Familiar to the shepherds of Canterbury as `Bloody Spaniard'.

Quote:  That unpleasant kind of spear-grass which grows on the ranges in Taranaki and which is popularly known by the sobriquet of Wild Irishman, seems to be in bad repute wherever it is found. Dr. Von Haast says that in the South Island it is called Bloody Spaniard.

Quote:  When first walking along steep mountain sides, catching hold of friendly tussocks for support, sometimes by mistake you catch a young Spaniard, and then you know why our "rude forefathers," the pioneers, often called it the "bloody Spaniard"; it really and truly was; I have proved it.
