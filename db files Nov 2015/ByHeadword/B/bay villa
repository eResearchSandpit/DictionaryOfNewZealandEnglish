Quote:  It refers specifically to the villa type with a bay window on the front facade (and, in larger versions, on a side facade too). It is a term one hears often (in fact I devoted a section to the `bay villa' in an architectural thesis I recently completed). The `bay' refers to the bay window (naturally enough); and also, some say, to San Francisco Bay. It was (and is) a house form common in that city; and it may well have spread to New Zealand from there.
