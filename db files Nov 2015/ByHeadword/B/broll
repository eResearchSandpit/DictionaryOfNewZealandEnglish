Quote:  Daily News Sept 22 14 we have gone on to broll, which is a by-product from the wheat mills. It's a sort of bran. We had been looking for something like a brewer's grain or broll for a long time. The main difference between broll and maize is that while they are the same in energy, broll has the highest protein content, and that energy is starch energy .. broll, if fed correctly, can have a huge impact on your protein test.
