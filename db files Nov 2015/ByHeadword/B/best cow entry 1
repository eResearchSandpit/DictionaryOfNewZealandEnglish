Quote:  He knew what the 'best cow' was. It was the tap outside the milking shed which the unscrupulous dairyman looked on as the cheapest milk. He has the story of a dairy farmer's wife, who during the visit of an inspector to the farm, in some distress advised her husband that the 'best cow' was choking. The farmer rushed outside to remove a potato which the children had stuffed up the tap outside the back door.
