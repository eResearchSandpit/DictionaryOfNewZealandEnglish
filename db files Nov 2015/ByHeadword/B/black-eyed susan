Notes: Jim Cameron writes: NSOD defines this as "any of various plants having light-coloured flowers with dark centres esp. the yellow Rudbeckia hirta of North America". In NZ it is (or was) the common name for the quite different gazania esp. when growing wild. I recall them along the beachfront at Eastbourne in the late 30s.
