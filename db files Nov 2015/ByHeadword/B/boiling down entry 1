Quote:   `Boiling-down' was formerly practised to a considerable extent in Australia; the mere fat or tallow of the animal for export to England <i>being worth far more than the meat for colonial consumption</i>. `Boiling-down establishments' were formed in the pastoral districts, and the process became a regular business. The sheep or cattle were killed and skinned, the carcass thrown into the boiling vat, the fat skimmed off for export tallow, and the meat thrown away. `Boiling down' will probably remain a permanent feature of Australian grazing in the districts remote from large towns.
