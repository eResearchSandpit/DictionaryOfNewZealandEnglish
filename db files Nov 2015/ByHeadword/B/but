Quote:  I've grown fond of the innovative Kiwi "but" meaning "I must admit" at the end of a sentence. TV watchers must have all seen that high-country musterer detailing the delights of a new girlfriend, then reassuring his mate with, "She doesn't drink Speights, but". Now we have test driver Greg Murphy judging a new four-wheel drive after a spectacular run: "She's tough. But."

Quote:  There is no local grammar. The local usage which comes to mind, and it is not widespread, is the use of <i>but</i> as an adverb at the end of a sentence, an equivalent of <i>however.</i> ... The man who took our luggage in the air terminal at Sydney ... agreed [the Sydney climate] was good, then added `We've got central heating, but'. I first heard this usage in 1945 in Auckland among students at a Teacher's College, where it was a bit of an affectation or craze rather than established unconscious usage, but.
