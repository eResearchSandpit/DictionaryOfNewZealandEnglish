Quote:   We have heard a good deal about Seagulls and Body-snatchers, yet there are few people who know the origin of the phrase or the appellation. The words have been coined and used by the disgruntled section of the Watersiders' Union. ... Now it is generally known that a Body-snatcher is a man who rushes in on another man's job when the going is good and slips back to his own work when things get slack.
