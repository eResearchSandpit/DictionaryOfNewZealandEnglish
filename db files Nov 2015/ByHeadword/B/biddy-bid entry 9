Quote:  Piri-piri (<i>acaena sanguisorbe</i>) [Morris, sanguisorbe sic] by the settlers has been converted or corrupted into <i>biddy-biddy</i>; a verb has been formed on it, which is in very constant use for a great [Morris, good: check] part of the year at least. To biddy is to rid one of burrs, as `I'll just biddy my clothes before I come in'.
