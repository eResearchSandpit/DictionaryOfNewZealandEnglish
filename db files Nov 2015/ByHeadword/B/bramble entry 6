Quote:  In the New Zealand Exhibition of 1865, there was shown an `Unintoxicating Wine, made from the juice of the `Wild Bramble' growing in Hawke's Bay.' [fn Jurors' Reports, p.74.] This is probably a mere expressed juice, sweetened or not; and analogous to Toot Wine.
Notes:  [discussing <i>Rubus</i> spp.]
