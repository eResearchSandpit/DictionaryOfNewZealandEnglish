Quote:  When the All blacks confront France in the one-off rugby international at Jade Stadium on Saturday, it will be 17 years to the day that the "Baby Blacks" were born.  That was the name given to a New Zealand team stripped of All Blacks by the controversial and unauthorised Cavaliers tour to South Africa earlier in the year, and thrown against a French team brimming with caps and confidence.
