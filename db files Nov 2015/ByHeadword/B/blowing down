Quote:  A system of sluicing in which strips of ground about 3 yards wide, on each side of a gutter, are sluiced into a gutter which runs down the slope. The work begins at the top of the slope and works down to a tail-race already constructed at the bottom ... <i>The Blowing-Down

System of Sluicing</i>. This is a novel system of sluicing that has been successfully used for the working of wide stretches of poor alluvial ground in Central Otage. Its greatest application has been in the Cromwell District where it has been in use for over thirty years. It was first introduced by a Russian miner, and, although long in use, is almost unknown outside of Central Otago.
