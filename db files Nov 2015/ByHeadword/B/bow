Quote:  <i>Bow</i> (1) The bows are the curved parts at the top of the handle of a pair of sheep shears. They give the shears their spring open after the shearer has made his blow. All shears are now made with double bows; but until about the 'seventies single bows were the only kind. (2) The iron that holds the yoke to a bullock's neck (see <i>bullocks</i>). ([1890- 1910])

Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  So most of us stick to `the blades,' the big shining steel shears eight and a half inches long, with a double spring `bow' on the end to keep them apart.

Quote:  <i>Bow</i>. The curved top of the handle of the shears which incorporates the spring. Until the late 1870s shears were made with only one bow and the extra tension made them more difficult to operate. Now all shears have double bows.
