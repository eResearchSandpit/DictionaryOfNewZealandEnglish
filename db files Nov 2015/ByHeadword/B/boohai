Quote:  Arthritis in the hands forced Titahi Bay artist Kerry Moore to 'paint' with words, and it has resulted in his first novel, <i>The Boo-Eye</i>. Set in 1950s New Zealand, in a town "10 miles from nowhere". (or in other words, in the boo-eye), three young men go on an odyssey of discovery that is both tragic and triumphant.

Quote:  Some slang terms seems to be peculiar to certain districts. An example is the Auckland term <i>up the Puhoi</i> or <i>Boohoy</i> (its form varies a good deal) meaning `gone somewhere or other' and this is a genuine local product referring to an old German settlement on the coast north of Auckland and little, if at all, in use elsewhere in New Zealand. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/680 Examples of slang and colloquial expressions of local origin are ...<i> up the boohai</i> (and other forms) for `off in some unknown locality', an Aucklander's idiom. [Wall does not seem to completely relate these two statements]

Quote:  The oldest son, John, left Puhoi when he was 16 to settle in Auckland. He found a job as a grocer's boy, and played the fiddle at night to pay his board. In 1907 he founded the National Trading Co in Customs St. `The expression `up the Buhoi' was said to have originated with him because when he was asked where he came from, that was what he replied in his strong accent - the same pronunciation of the name of our village can still be heard in Puhoi today,' said Mrs Williams.
