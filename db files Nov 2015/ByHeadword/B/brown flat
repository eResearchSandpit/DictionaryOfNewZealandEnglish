Quote:  Button mushrooms still dominate about 75 per cent of our market, but having arrived just four years ago, the brown giant with a cap the size of a mini-pizza is now muscling for space on every supermarket shelf... Actually, these "brown flats", "gourmet browns", "portobellos" (call them what you will) are nothing more than brown button mushrooms which have been allowed to grow up.

Quote:  These big brown mushrooms... are an American strain of the standard cultivated mushroom <i>Agaricus bisporus</i>. In the United States, they are known as portobello. Here, Clive Thompson [of Parkvale Mushrooms in Carterton] chose to give them the traditional New Zealand name "brown flats".
