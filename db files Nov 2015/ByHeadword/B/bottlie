Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies. ...When I first went to school, bottlies were good currency, being classed as two-ers, but usually sodawaters and black-bottlies counted as the
equivalent of six-ers. ... (Petone, Wellington, 1913)

Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.

Quote:  Bottlies - the glass marble stoppers from the tops of bottles. These worked perfectly well but were not considered to be high class.
