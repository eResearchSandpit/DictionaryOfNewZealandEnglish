Quote:  `Press' and `sweep' are technical terms for necessary operations in the woolshed at shearing time. The former refers to pressing the fleeces into tight-packed bales ... to facilitate the transport of an otherwise bulky commodity. The latter is the process of keeping the floor (the `boards'), on which the sheep are shorn, clear of loose ends of wool, dirt and excrement.
