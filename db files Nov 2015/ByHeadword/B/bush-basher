Quote:  Bush-bashing comes easily in Suzuki's dinky little wagon [heading] ... It has always been a source of amazement to true-blue four wheel drive fanatics, just how many people use the little Suzuki off roader as a round-town hack.

Obstensibly designed as a mini bush-basher, the Suzuki has nevertheless proved to be a winner among the rich and trendy people from places such as Parnell, Herne Bay or Eastbourne.
