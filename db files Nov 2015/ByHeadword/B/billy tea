Notes: --[Cf description in 1945 Simpson If You'd Care to Know 99-100  The billy is filled with water and suspended over a fire ... When the water boils, the tea is popped in, the lid is clamped down to confine the flavour, and the billy is removed from the fire. A few minutes is allowed for the brew to `draw', and there is your tea in the Australian bush fashion. Maybe there is no sugar in it, and of a certainty there is no milk or lemon; you take this liquor straight and you take it hot, although the temperature of the day may be a hundred in the shade.] W. Ramson: common in Aust., also a trade name; nf W3.] Tea made in a billy over a fire, tea made by tossing a handful of tea-leaves into a billy of water on <i>the boil (used often with the epithet</i> black,<i> either defining</i> tea from the strength of the tea made judged by its colour); or <i>billy</i> from its open-fire blackened appearance: cf [1864 Apr 16 Otago Witness in 1976 Veitch Clyde on the Dunstan 29-30 Heavily swagged diggers and laden horses whose swags consist of all the household goods of a mining party, from the black billy which boils the tea, to the tom cat which kills the rats and mice.]

Quote:  Of billy tea. Waiting until the billy boils, throwing in half a handful of tea, trying to hook the billy off the fire before it boils over, and tapping the side with a spoon to settle the leaves. Then demonstrating a touch of skill by pouring the tea over the billy handle and into your chipped enamel cup and swallowing the brew in hot blowy gulps.
