Quote:   Pressing. - When there is sufficient wool in one bin, the pressers (generally two) get to work. One gets into the `box' as the lower portion of the patent presses is called, while his mate ... hands him ... the fleeces. These are placed in tiers, and tramped down until the lower box is full. An upper box is then swung ... or [16] lowered on to the lower one, and the process repeated. When full, the `monkey' or cover is put into position, the spears (wire rope) affixed, and the two men lever the cover down until the top box is clear.
