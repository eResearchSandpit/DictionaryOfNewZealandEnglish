Quote:  In some cases restorative justice processes are used, whereby offenders meet the offended against and agree on how to remedy the offence - usually by painting over ("buffing" in hip-hop talk) the offending signature... Angry residents, neighbourhood groups, church groups, councils and community service agencies throughout the country are buffing away daily in the belief that, if you paint over a tag within 24 hours, the tagger will eventually give up on that particular wall.
