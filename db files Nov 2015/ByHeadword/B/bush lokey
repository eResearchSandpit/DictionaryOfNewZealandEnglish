Quote:  The typical bush lokey of this early period was the four-wheel direct-drive type imported from England weighing between 5 and 10 onnes. <i>Ibid</i> 79 A special type of bush lokey was developed to operate over these newer lines which were built far beyond the alignment limits of 'normal' railways. Because more power was required, the special bush lokeys were bigger than those used previously. <i>Ibid.</i> 83 The introduction of the first bush lokeys in New Zealand was concurrent with the initial railway construction boom and the first steam-powered mineral railways.
