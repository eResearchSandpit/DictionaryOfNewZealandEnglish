Quote:   There is no keeping him from [drink] as long as there is a <i>shot in the locker</i> ... I have seen him, when he is in the blues run up the gully as if he had a thousand devils after him. <i>Ibid.</i> 51 He said he had been [on the spree] for three weeks, and did not expect <i>the blues</i> for a fortnight yet.
