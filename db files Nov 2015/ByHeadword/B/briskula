Quote:  There was a time when the game of cards, known as Briskula was king, If you did not play <i>Briskula</i>, you were not a Dalmatian, as it went with the breed. Every house and boarding hosue and club had its Briskula dens... In Briskula there were some distinctions - you led or were led. There was the traditional banging of fists and the cursing by all. If you won, you were great, if you lost, you were a fool and were abused by all, including your own... T heir fathers [50] didn't care much - they were out back drinking and playing cards - <i>Briskula and Treseta</i>, match-making, after all was women's work.
