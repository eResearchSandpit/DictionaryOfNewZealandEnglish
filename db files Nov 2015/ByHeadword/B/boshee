Quote:  But the attitude of the settlers was not wholly a product of their environment. To a large extent their prejudice was imported with them. Those who had encountered few Maoris, like the Otago and Canterbury settlers, were as biassed as the rest. The Maori was called `nigger',

`black', and in the <i>Auckland Examiner</i>, `Boshee' [subscript 44] by people who had never seen a slave. The word `Maori' conjured up in the settlers' minds a stereotype based on experience in other colonies. [fn44] Perhaps a mixture of `bosh' and `Quashee', a West Indian negro.
Notes:  [?1860s]
