Quote:  With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri,</i> entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii,</i> round-leaved beech.

Quote:  <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodkinson, August 9, 1854.)

Quote:  Five species of <i>Nothofagus</i> were formerly recognised in New Zealand, but more recently two of these have been combined as varieties of one species. <i>Nothofagus menziesii</i>: silver beech (the bark is white and silvery particularly in young trees). <i>Nothofagus fusca:</i> red beech (the timber is reddish in colour). <i>Nothofagus truncata:</i> hard beech (the wood has a high silica content making it hard). <i>Nothofagus solandri</i> var. <i>solandri</i>: black beech (the bark is very dark partly due to the growth of a sooty mould). <i>Nothofagus solandri </i>var. <i>cliffortioides</i>: mountain beech (grows mainly at higher altitudes than other beeches).
