Quote:  <i>piopio</i>, a bush-bird (Turnagra tanagara), the North Island thrush and (T. capensis) the South Island form: both extinct soon after 1900. A riverbed bird, the dotterel, and a narrow-leaved plant, dianella, also bear this name, but the thrush is usually associated with the name: in any case the dianella has a name tu[u]rutu.
