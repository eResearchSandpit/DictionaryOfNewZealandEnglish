Quote:  These are extra heavy underpants, dark colour, hip pocket, and cost 10/-. ca1954 R.Mason notes: `According to two old bushmen, Joe Gibbs and Sandy Donaldson, bushmen wore (and may still wear) long, red, woollen underpants at work. They do not get wet as quickly as trousers, do not flap uncomfortably around the legs when wet, and keep the legs warm. Trampers often do likewise in snow and in cold wet windy weather when it is too cold for shorts.

Quote:  A <i>bushman</i> is one who lives and works in the bush, or sometimes one skilled in bushcraft. Judging by a remark in the <i>Tramper</i> of 1933 there were articles known as <i>bushmen's trousers</i> on sale. These were a type of garment pretty much the same as long woollen underpants, but made for outer wear and provided with pockets.
