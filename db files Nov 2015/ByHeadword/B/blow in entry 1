Quote:  It appeared that from October to Christmas he had made [pounds]2000 and he was now engaged in `blowing it in'. He was reeling down the street ...and when he saw me he called out, `Hey, Tom, I'm flyblown just now but come with me in a day or two and I will make your fortune for you.' [171] ... You ask what the term `flyblown' meant. It was a word used in those days [c1860s] and meant a man had no money, but once I saw a man really flyblown.
