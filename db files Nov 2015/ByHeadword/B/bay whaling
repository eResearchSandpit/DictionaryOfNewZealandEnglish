Quote:  An old-time bay whaling station consisted ... of at least two boats, with their crew of six men each. The headsman, or mate, four ordinary oarsmen, and the harpooner, or `boat-steerer,' who pulled the bow-oar, and drove in the harpoon, and who, when the whale had been struck and `fastened on,' went aft and steered the boat, while the mate took his place, and by repeated lance-thrusts killed it.
