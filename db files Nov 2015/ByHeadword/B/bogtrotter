Quote:  Mary Agnes's older brother Leo played the jovial Irishman, yarning and cracking with the men in the bar, while in private despising them for the bogtrotters they were, the feckless idle Paddies of the jokes and the skits, content to root a bare living from the sour coastal pakihi, exactly as they might have done at home.
