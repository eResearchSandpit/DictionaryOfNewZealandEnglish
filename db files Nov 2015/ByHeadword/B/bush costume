Quote:   The bush costume of the [Artillery] officers in New Zealand [c.1846] consists of a blue serge shirt, coarse trowsers, hobnail boots, and a cabbage-leaf hat or cap; as like the dress of the street orderlies as anything can be. It is a pity that those who identify a soldier with his red coat, gold lace, feathers and trappings, cannot see the reverse of the picture.

Quote:  A little more attention to dress, and somewhat more formality of manner, are observable in Auckland than in the other settlements. The colonial practice of standing idly smoking at the shop doors in broad daylight, and of wearing bush costume is more honoured in the breach than the observance.
