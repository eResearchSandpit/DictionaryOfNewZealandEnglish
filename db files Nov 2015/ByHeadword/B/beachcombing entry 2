Quote:  I remember when I was beachcombing up in the Bay of Islands ... What, just living off the beach, Son? ... Yeah. Bit of fishing and mussel-picking, sheep-stealing and garden-raiding when a man felt energetic or hungry.

Quote:  Generally the greater portion of the sand is removed, but in favourable spots, sheltered either by a

slight indentation in the coast-line, or by some large pieces of drifted timber, its heavier particles remain; these consist [529] of black iron-sand (both magnetic and titaniferous oxide of iron) associated with small garnets and with gold. These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

Quote:  While putting up a printing office [in Port Nicholson] I picked up two wanderers, who I engaged to saw ... I adopted them because they were shaved and clean. ... They appeared to me to contrast to great advantage [?with] the regular `beach comber'. I write the phrase large because I think it is [???new] to you. It is appropriate to the class. Its meaning I assume is evident. The `beach combing' class is large. The fellows are daring, dirty, requiring much excitement, accustomed to

work on shore and on board, generally about the beach, and take what they find without any very strong sense of doing that which is improper.

Quote:  ... such political beachcombing vituperation as has been indulged  in [by the Petone Chronicle].

-->[The reference here may be partly and snidely to the fact that Petone is a beachfront town.]

Quote:  Idle, drunken vagabond ... he wanders about without any fixed object, cannot get employed by the whaler or anyone else, as it is out of his power to do a day's work; and he is universally known as the `beach-comber'. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/4 Even the corrupt beachcombers and whalers of Kapiti would go out of their way to say a good word ... for Mr. Hadfield.
