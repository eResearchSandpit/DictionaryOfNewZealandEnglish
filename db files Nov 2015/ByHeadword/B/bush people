Quote:  The way in which the bush people - the bushmen and their wives - stuck to one another is shown by the way they rallied round in the case of a family that was in need. A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ... Now I've seen them pay twelve ... pounds in those days for a basket, just to make sure that the girl of the boy's choice saw that he really meant business. ... Every penny of that would go to the family in need ...
