Quote:  His book included an account of "barrelling", or organised beatings... The cadet said time and place of barrelling would be spread among the cadets, and the staff would disappear. A cadet of the early 1880s, Mike, describes a "lesser barrelling", which involved being tied to a bed, taken outside and leaned up against a wall. Shaving cream, toothpaste, nugget and even excrement were rubbed on the victim who was then hosed off.
Notes:  1980s not 1880s presumably (and he would be very hosed off I should imagine) TD
