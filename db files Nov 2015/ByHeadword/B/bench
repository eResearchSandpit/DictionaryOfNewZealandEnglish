Quote:  One of my correspondents, tramping with her husband, referred to the `benched-out' track they were following up the hillside, to be met by an uncomprehending stare.... She, on the other hand, knew of no other name for the kind of farm track that at one time was dug and is now more commonly bulldozed along and up a hillside. `Benched-out' roads, she assures me, climbed all over Banks Peninsula where she was brought up and it had not occurred to her that the phrase was in any way unusual.
