Quote:  When you [the watersider] show grey under your skull cap you find you are not selling so freely as formerly. Your closest friend then mostly is a stringer on a pile, to which you mutter your sorrows, as the young emigrant, the `Baby Bliss' of wharf parlance, take[s] your place in the hold and shed.
