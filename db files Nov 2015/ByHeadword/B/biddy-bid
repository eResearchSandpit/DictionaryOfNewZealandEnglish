Quote:  Hence the plant [<i>Acaena sanguisorbae</i>] is only too familiar, as the `Native Burr' to the sheep farmers alike of New Zealand, Australia, and Tasmania. ... To the Otago settler the plant is also known as the `Bidi-bidi,' or `Beta-beta;' to the North Island Maori as `Hutiwai,' `Piri-piri,' (Colenso), or `Piri-kahu,' (Colenso).

Quote:  PIRI PIRI (<i>Aceara ... sanguisorbae</i>). This name is commonly corrupted into [called] bidi bid. In the North Island the plant is called hutiwai or utiwai and by mistake poroporo. It is a native species well known to all New Zealanders, and is a weed chiefly on land in process of being brought into occupation.

Quote:  Piri-piri (<i>Acaena sanguisorbae</i>) by the settlers has been converted or corrupted into biddy-biddy; a verb has been formed on it, which is in very constant use for a great part of the year at least. To biddy is to rid one of burrs, as `I'll just biddy my clothes before I come in'.
