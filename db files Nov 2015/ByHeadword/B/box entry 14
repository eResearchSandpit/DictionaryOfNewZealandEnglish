Quote:  box: separate lines of sheep or cattle that have been mixed together. There is a delicate nuance in the use of this word: if they have been mixed deliberately they have 'been boxed'.. If it all happened by accident, to be sure they 'got boxed.' And the latter case is inclined to occasion some pretty sulphurous language to foul the air.
