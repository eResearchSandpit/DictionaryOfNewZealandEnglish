Quote:  The bullockies invariably took their hack, known as the `bullock horse' with them, ... These horses were tied on behind the drays by a neck-rope, and dragged along if they were not inclined to go willingly. Sometimes, when the dray was being driven through low scrub, the bullock horses would get some nasty knocks from the stems flying up and hitting them.
