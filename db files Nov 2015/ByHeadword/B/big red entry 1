Quote:  From 1949 till 1964, the year the capital's last tram ran, council-owned Wellington City Transport built up a fleet of 199 [trolley] buses. Until the mid-1950s they were painted silver and called "silver ghosts" because they were so quiet. Then they were painted red like the trams they replaced and became fondly known as the Big Reds.
