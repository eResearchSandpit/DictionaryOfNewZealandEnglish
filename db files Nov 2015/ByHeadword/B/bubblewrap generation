Quote:  As the 90s became the new century, many of these baby-boomers - now parents - began to circumscribe their children's licence to walk in their shoes. Some go so far as to dub this :"the bubblewrap generation". No longer do kids walk to school - the roads are unsafe and paedophiles might lurk along the route.
