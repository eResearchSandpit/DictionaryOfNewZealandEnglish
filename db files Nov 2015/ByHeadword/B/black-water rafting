Quote:  [Hdg] Zorbing not for the pink-knuckled... New Zealand has contributed the terms zorbing and black-water rafting. Zorbing is an entertainment where those taking part are suspended inside giant plastic balls and rolled down steep slopes. Black-water rafting is the pastime of floating along pitch-black underground streams in inflated inner tubes.

Quote:  Making a splash is what black-water rafting is all about - for rafters and the new owners of the original Black Water Rafting Company. Tourism Holdings this month takes control of the 10-year old business which pioneered trips for tourists in inflatable rubber tubes along cold underwater caves of Waitomo.

Quote:  "We represent a company called Blackwater Rafting, who are involved in cave tubing," Mr Bassett said. "Unfortunately, they lost exclusive rights to their name when a judge ruled that Blackwater rafting had become a generic name for cave tubing and others in the industry could use it... For example, Blackwater Rafting was involved in cave tubing, but the media continued to describe the activity as blackwater rafting. The company should have corrected this the first time, as by not doing so the term eventually became generic."
