Quote:  At first glance the food mass in the weasel's stomach appeared blackish with numerous tiny yellow flecks. This proved to be the remains of a juvenile Whitaker's skink, which made up about 70% of the stomach contents. The rest of the stomach's contents were comprised of the remains of a juvenile brown skink Leiolopisma zelandicum and three tiny invertebrates (a spider, an isopod and a fly) that may have come from the skinks' stomachs.

Quote:  We carried out captive-based behavioural comparisons between striped skinks and the common terrestrial brown skink (Oligosoma zelandicum). Brown skinks are of similar mass to striped skinks and overlap in geographic range and habitat, but are easily captured by hand and pitfall trapping in the wild.

Quote:  Brown skinks are now present in the Taranaki area and the western half of the southern North Island, on Kapiti Island, Mana Island .. and possibly on islands in Wellington Harbour. Brown skinks are also found in the northern and north-western South Island. Brown skinks frequently co-exist with common skinks .. and at a few localities with spotted skinks. Brown, common, spotted and speckled skinks co-exist in Marlborough Sounds on Stephens Island/Takapourewa and are likely to have once done so in the Wellington area ...
