Quote:  In the Straits [we ran into] an opposite burster. Some of these winds come on gradually until they reach their greatest force ... others burst upon the crew with all their fury and then gradually decline. This latter has received the name `butt-ender' from its resemblance to that part of a gun which is the heaviest, strongest and broadest.
