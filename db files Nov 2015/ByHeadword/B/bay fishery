Quote:  I do not think either natives or settlers could live any great time in this part [Chalky Inlet] from the myriads of poisonous flies in summer and the cold in winter. We have seen some marks of visitors but whether natives or whites for the bay fishery (I should suppose the latter) I do not know.
