Quote:  It is customary to invite all the neighbours to your `muster,' as they can then pick out their missing sheep which have strayed from the adjoining runs. As they complete each flock, it is turned over to a shepherd, who would drive it off with the aid of his dogs to a beat, possibly ten or twenty miles distant ...

Quote:  Boy was certainly the fastest sheep dog I have ever seen. He put in a splendid hunt, which would have been a bad head if the sheep had not been so fast, and hunted them all on to the next man's beat. <i>Ibid.</i> 18 I was two beats from the top, and there was shingle all the way. It slid continuously, and all the time I had to bear up hill, to keep a level track. However, we got off `the hill' quite early, put the sheep across Cat Creek at Tarndale, and raced for the homestead.
