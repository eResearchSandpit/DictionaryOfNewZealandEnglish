Quote:  Perhaps the commonest tree [near Waikouaiti] is one that I was not aware of having seen before. It grows to a considerable size, but in a very twisted, irregular shape. Its leaf is of a smooth, glossy, green colour, about the size of the leaf of a Portugal laurel, but more heart-shaped. The native name of the tree is kapuka. It is commonly called broad-leaf by the white men there.
