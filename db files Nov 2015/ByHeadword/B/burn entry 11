burn
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:(an instance of) clearing bush, scrub, unpalatable grass, etc. from the land by means of fire to improve pasture or to bring into cultivation by clearing logs or bush.

(There seems a distict cleavage between early South Island and early NI usage, cf. burn v1. In the South Island `a burn' was a periodical burning off of old tussock to prepare the way for good crop of new grass. In 20th century usage, however, has been applied (e.g. in the Pelorus Sounds) to burning off noxious weeds, fern, scrub etc. to get a good growth of green feed (cf. match-farming). In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning))

Quote:  The season promised to be a good one for bush-burning; and those who had bush-felled were congratulating themselves on the prospect of getting excellent `burns,' while many, who, ... had been unfortunate in getting bad `burns,' were now hopeful of clearing off much of the timber by means of a second fire.
