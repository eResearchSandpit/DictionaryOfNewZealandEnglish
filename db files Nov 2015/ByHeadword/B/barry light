Quote:  Then caver ingenuity came to the rescue in the form of Hamilton speleologist Barry Weir. Weir came up with a 100w helmet light set like a cherry in an aluminium throwaway pie dish which when charged will give 20-30 minutes' illumination. These 45c battery-powered devices even provided light when caving divers went underwater ... The device has been so successful it has been used subsequently. The inventor now has his name in lights. Crews in Dunedin refer to them as `Barry lights'.
