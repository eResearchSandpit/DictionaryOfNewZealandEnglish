Quote:  Not a week has passed without my having had to make communication to Europeans living at a distance from the Waimate; and whatever might be the value of what was to be sent, I had no hesitation in giving it in charge to a bush-native, accustomed to Europeans, but has all his life resided among his own people.

Quote:  ... from all I have seen in New Zealand, I am convinced that the formidable pictures of bush-natives which have been drawn are purely the result of imagination. The natives in general are much too civilised and social, and know their own interests too well, to live in a gloomy and inhospitable forest.

Quote:  Ekehu discovered signs of the place having been recently occupied by natives ... We were yet 75 miles from ... the Ngaitahu tribe ... Were they bush natives? Jacky and Etau appeared to think the vicinity of such individuals rather objectionable.
