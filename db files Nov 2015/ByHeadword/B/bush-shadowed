Quote:  Here the Public Works gangs still use the pick and shovel. The rattle of their implements, and the occasional echoing wham of a charge of gelly, and the deepening engine note of a passing vehicle as it changes into low gear on the ... slippery bush-shadowed bends, seem only to nibble at the vast silence.
