Quote:  Beefy Lucas Maxwell is blazing a brave new trail for blokes - by entering the bridesmaid category in tonight's Taranaki bride of the year competition. In recognition of his bold step, the category has been renamed as the gender-friendly "bride attendants" and Mr Maxwell's job title is "bridesdude".
