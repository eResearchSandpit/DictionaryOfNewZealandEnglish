Quote:  I yoked up the bullocks. The bullock yoke was a square piece of white pine smoothed and hollowed out to fit the necks of the two bullocks, with holes for the iron bows which went round the neck and through the yoke, being fastened above with a key tied with a bit of greenhide; in the centre a bolt with a ring called `the start' passed through the yoke, to which the chain was fastened from the sledge.
