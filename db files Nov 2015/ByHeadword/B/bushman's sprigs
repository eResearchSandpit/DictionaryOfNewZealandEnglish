Quote:  A bushman always wore a special type of boot known as `ferntights', named because the upper part of the boot was sewn inside the lower leather, preventing sharp stakes from penetrating the seam and tearing the stitching. Round-headed hobnails were replaced with square-headed "bushman's springs" [sic].It was essential when standing on roots to have a firm footing and "bushman's sprigs" helped to prevent us losing our foothold on a slippery bank.
