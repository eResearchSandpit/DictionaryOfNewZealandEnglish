Quote:  Even in New Zealand's early farming days the flock followed the shepherd who led a bell-wether. This was usually a tame sheep wearing a collar with a bell .. In later years the bell-wether was the fore-runner of the Judas sheep in the freezing works.

Quote:  Bell-wether. To this day tame wethers are used to lead others to their doom in the freezing works. They carry no bell but still retain a broad leather collar. This will protect them, and would effectively blunt the knife of a sticker who might absent mindedly seek to slit the wrong throat.
