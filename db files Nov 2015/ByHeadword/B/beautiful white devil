Quote:  GREATER CONVOLVULUS [BINDWEED] (<i>Calystegia sepium</i>) has the same popular names as the last species, [i.e. convolvulus] and in addition, beautiful white devil, and its native name of pohue. It is much like convolvulus [bindweed], but is larger in all its parts. The leaves are 3 to 5 inches in length and the flower 2 inches across, more usually white than pink.
