Quote:  Then, on the other side of the coin from the `apathetic students', there is a group which decries the administration I have talked about as `bourgeois, capitalist and politically unsound'. They want to advance Students Associations as bases for radical political movements rather than `conservative' servicing of the membership; students. There are a number of descriptive terms - `loonies', `bozos', `bunnies' and `touchie-feelies' - in general, the `looney left'.
