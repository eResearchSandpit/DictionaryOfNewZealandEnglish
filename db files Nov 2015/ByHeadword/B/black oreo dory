Quote:  THIS week's fish is the black oreo dory, also known as black dory, deepwater dory, and at my local suppliers - deepsea dory. The fish is taken by deepsea trawling ... Don't confuse it with the john dory. In spite of its name, the black oreo dory is not a member of the zeidae family of true dories ...
