Quote:  There's a new verb doing the rounds in Parliament: to boag. It means to chop the legs out from underneath, as in the deadwood Nats who were denied the chance to exit with dignity when National Party president Michelle Boag decided to clear space for new blood.  The word most recently appeared in an e-mail suggesting Clark apologise to deadwood MPs for "the injustice and mental abuse served up to us by the National Party". If she does, the missive says, "then we can boag Boag."
