Notes: ca1935 Havelock ca1960s G.J.Griffiths notes: Aust, but also fully used in NZ; originally merely a slang contraction of beauty or beautiful but now virtually a usage in its own right; but only oral ca1950 2ZB Wellington in Aunt Jenny's `True-life Stories', Jimmy Blake continually uses the aj: e.g. `A beaut new heat-controlled iron is the first prize' to imply a childlike enthusiasm or innocence.

Quote:  Once when she couldn't have me Dad let me go to the flicks by myself. He gave me some extra money, so I went to the milkbar and bought a gobstopper and some other lollies. I stuffed my face, and felt crook all the way home. He bought new footy boots for my eldest brother too, and an Art Union ticket for Mum. He must have had a beaut time up the RSA that day, I reckon.
