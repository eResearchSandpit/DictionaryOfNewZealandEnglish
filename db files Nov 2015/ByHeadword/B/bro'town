Quote:  To its credit, <i>bro'Town</i> doesn't just skid over the settling pond of superficial textual referencing; there's also nutrient in the lumps beneath... Ultimately, <i>bro'Town</i> is fishing in its own lagoon so it knows the territory and is able to catch much more than just the ratings fish.

Quote:  <i>bro'Town</i> is very much a boy's world - the product of the all-male theatre ensemble known as 'The Naked Samoans.' [223] With a notion of open-ended kinship embedded in its very title - you don't have to be 'blood' to be a 'bro' - <i>bro'Town</i> points to the ways that art can serve as a much needed bridge from cultural specificity to universal humanism.
