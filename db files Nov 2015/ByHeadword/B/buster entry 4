Quote:  If, when a change is evidently coming up from the south, no mist rests on its rounded top, the change will pass off as a `dry souther,' a skiff of big cold drops blown up in fierce raw gusts; even when rain continues and the fatal cloud cap remains away, our auguries are hopeful, and though half an inch or so may fall, we do not aticipate a `buster.' When the cloud cap settles heavy rain always follows.
