Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  A minimum of blows applied on the sheep should be aimed at. ... On good average-shearing crossbred sheep anything from fifty to sixty blows is satisfactory. <i>Ibid.</i> 65 The best way of working when crutching is to go at a good smart pace for half an hour and then have a five minutes' blow.
