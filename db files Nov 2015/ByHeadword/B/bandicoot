Quote:  Another was also proud of the growth of his potatoes but highly amazed and full of anger when upon digging them up he found virtually nothing underneath. He was unaware that some bright sparks had on one night bandicooted his spuds. Bandicooting as it was called, was done by scratching away the dirt from the spuds, taking them from underneath the tops and replacing the mulch and everything looked normal.
