Quote:  <i>Penny Doctor</i> beetles, also known as `Butcher bats' is a game widely reported by Wellington Training College students as being played in many parts of the North Island. In this game straws moistened by spittle are pushed down the hole of the appropriate beetle. The beetle seizes the end of the straw. When the player feels the straw moving he or she flicks out the beetle. The player who can catch the most beetles wins the game.

Quote:  The most widely known game with insects is a game named variously by T.C. students as Butcher Boys (Gisborne, New Plymouth, Kaponga, [405] Te Pohu, Newall, Sth. Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui). It is a game in which straws which have been suitably moistened with spittle are placed in an insects [sic] hole and are flicked out when the insect bites the end of the straw. Most of the reports of this practice come from the North Island, though it was known in the South as early as 1900 (Waikouaiti).

Quote:  A universal animal play in the North Island, but known also in the South Island, was a game variously termed Butcher Bats, Butcher Boys, or Penny Doctor Beetles. In this game, straws suitably moistened at the end with spittle were placed down insect holes and flicked out when the insect bit the end of the straw. The player won who could flick a beetle up first.
