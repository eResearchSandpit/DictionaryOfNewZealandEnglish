Quote:  <i>Barking-up:</i> During the course of his mustering work the musterer frequently gets his team to bark while at heel (i.e. alongside him) the object being to frighten sheep along without actually running a dog. This is known as `barking-up'. On the free-running sheep this obviates a lot of work.
