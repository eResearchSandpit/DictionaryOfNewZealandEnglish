Quote:  Racecourse investigators stumbled on a real whodunnit when they started checking out why Arahiwi Prince returned a positive test to the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone... The committee said it was impossible to escape the conclusion that Arahiwi Prince was nobbled (sic) considering there was more bute in the horse on raceday than when another sample was taken..  one day after the horse was injected with the same drug to treat an infected hoof.
