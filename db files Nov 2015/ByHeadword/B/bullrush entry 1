Quote:  Bullrush involved as many of the school as possible, all at one end of the paddock, one person in the middle. At the cry of 'bullrush' we all ran and he had to catch one of us. It was also called Charlie across the water and kingaseeny

Quote:  In its simplest form bullrush involved one person standing in the middle of the field, then everyone else lined up on one side. The middle person would call someone's name (often in a rhyming way) into the middle. The object being of course to get past the middle to the other end of the field. If the runner was caught he or she joined the middle to call and catch more runners. Should a single runner get through there would be a bullrush, where everyone ran through the middle... These games had a thousand different names in earlier times: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down!), goosey and so on... An excellent variation was.. cockarusha, in which everyone, instead of running, tries to hop through the middle.

Quote:  Life itself is like a game of bullrush. Maybe that's why it is now virtually banned in every school in NZ, its [sic] too rough... Hayley has fond memories of bullrush, "That's where you got your boyfriends..."

Quote:  It's like a game of bullrush, in which the single-objective SOE rushes to the finish line, and everyone else gets a quick yank of the jersey if they're quick.

Quote:  Their frenzied games - tickling, playing bullrush, giving one another Chinese burns - had an element of schoolyard sadism that linked with a generalised sense of the grotesque.

Quote:   `Do you play Bull Rush at your school?' John asked. `Bull Rush?' said Ewan. ... `You get out on the field and draw a line at the ends. You pick someone to be He to stand in the middle. He calls out someone's name, and he has to get across to the other end. The guard has to try to tackle the runner and hit him three times. But if the runner gets across he calls out Bull Rush and everyone runs ...[sic]' `That's King-a-Sene!' said Ewan. `But we're only allowed to tag the player, we're not allowed to tackle him ...'[sic] ... `Do you play with the girls at all?' `Sometimes we play Drop the Handkerchief. The girls can join in. But most of the time they play Eely Ily Oh, or Queenie, or some cissy game like that...'[sic]

`Do you play shinty or football?' `Yeah. Football. And we play scrag in the winter and tippeny runs in the summer...'[sic]

Quote:  Is there one single New Zealamnder who has not played bullrush in some form or other?... There are variations. The main one is the classic 'bar the door' (which for some phonetically evolved into 'barbador'), where the main difference is that runners line up at both ends of the field. These games had a thousand names in earlier days: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down), goosey and so on... Kerikeri school banned it (they called it king asini) three years ago.

Quote:  In the foreground, the under-10 Dragons finish with bullrush.   They have already dodged puddles and clay clods to get to the gym, but there is energy left for threading round team-mates to reach the other side.
