Quote:  Although whitebaiters know them by the name "whalefeed" they are in fact the young of several species of freshwater bully: the redfinned bully (<i>Gobiomorphus huttoni</i>), the bluegilled bully (<i>Gobiomorphus hubbsi</i>) and the common bully (<i>Gobiomorphus cotidianus</i>)... The bluegilled bully is dinstinguished by a steely-blue stripe on the gill membranes and its distinctly dark-spotted, almost leopard-like pattern on the head.
