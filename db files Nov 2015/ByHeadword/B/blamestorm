Quote:  Heard about the latest overseas management theory that's making inroads into the Capital's psyche? After a project mishap, a team leader summons his group for a meeting where the participants "blamestorm",. You guessed it, there ain't no hugs or strokes in a blamestorming session. It's all about working out who's innocent and who takes the rap.
