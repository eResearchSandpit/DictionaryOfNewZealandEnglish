Quote:  Finally, there are those curious, yellow, spherical `fruit' of the so-called beech strawberry

(<i>Cyttaria gunnii</i>), a fungus which attacks the silver beech. These strawberry-like fruits form clusters on the twigs at the end of the branches, their honey-combed surface making recognition easy and certain.
