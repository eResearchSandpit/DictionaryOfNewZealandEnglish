Notes: ca1954 (R.Mason) used by A.L. Poole, a humorous name used in the NZ Forest Service for <i>P. radiata</i> timber, esp. in Canterbury. The Balmoral State Forest in Canterbury was heavily damaged by wind in the early 1950's, and the pine windfalls provide a plentiful (but hard to dispose of) source of timber.
