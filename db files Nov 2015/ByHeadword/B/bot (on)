Notes:  By the 1920s a bot is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun bot was translated to a verb, and as a result we have to bot, to borrow money, to impose on others, and botting, the practice. To bot on a person is widely used.
