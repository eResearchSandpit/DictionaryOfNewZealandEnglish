Quote:  <i>Braxy</i>.-A fatal disease of sheep. Sheep that die of it make wholesome mutton, and in Scotland are prepared (salted, I think) and eaten. I do not know that we have exactly the same disease in New Zealand; certainly we have not the custom of eating the victims of it; but it is a stock joke on stations to point out any stinking carcase to a Scotch shepherd and say: `There's a nice bit of <i>b</i>. mutton for you, `So and so.''
