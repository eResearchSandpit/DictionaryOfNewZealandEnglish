[Note from ed. AND in response to query are there native bindweeds in Aust. 1986. Yes, three native (2 of which endemic) spp. of <i>Convolvulus</i>. However OED definition (`The English name for the species of the N[atural] O[rder] <i>Convolvulus'</i>) covers our use of the word, so we haven't needed to make an entry. (1 quot only Mitchell 1848; 1 fig 1965).]
