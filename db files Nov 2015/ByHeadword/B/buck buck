Quote:  At school, however, there was little place for Duck Stones, with its dangerous stone-throwing; Tipcat, with `cats' a danger to eye and window in a crowded area; Buck Buck, with its backbreaking potential, particularly on asphalt; punching forms of Bar the Door; Cap On and Fly the Garter, also a danger on hard grounds and in crowded areas; hoops, Whip Top, and kites, for which there was less space.
