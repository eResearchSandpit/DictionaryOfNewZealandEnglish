Quote:  A team of enthusiasts has painstakingly dug out a 500-metre gentle uphill track that will give beginners and families access to what is becoming one of New Zealand's most popular bike parks. About 35,000 cyclists have visited the Makara Peak mountain bike park on the edge of Karori this year.
