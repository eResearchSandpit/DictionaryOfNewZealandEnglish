Quote:  Some of the sailors ... amused themselves by trying to ride some horses brought in from a wild mob running in the back-blocks. These horses would `buck a town down,' as the saying is. I saw one sailor get a cropper; he regained his feet quickly, ... and caught hold of the stirrup; whereupon the neddy `cow-kicked,' and caught him in the stomach.
