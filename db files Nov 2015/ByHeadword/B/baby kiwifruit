Quote:  Next off the block is likely to be commercial cultivars of actinidia arguta, which produces small, hairless grape-sized fruit. Already sold in Japan as "baby kiwifruit" since 1995, it has been targeted by Hortresearch breeders who want to carry the thin skin, high sugar content and flavour over into new cultivars.
