Quote:  as common in NZ in a variety of senses and uses as it is in gen. Eng. - esp. bit of a, pronounced [ ] and often spelt <i>bituva</i>, used adjectively for `small, little', and also ironically in understatement as `large' (e.g. 1944 `I must 'er made a bituva mistake, and opened up yer nose'): also used (esp. by children) adverbially as `rather': e.g. `It's bituva hot in here'. These and other uses are attested in OED(S) and EDD; cf hang of a; collocations (A) BIT OF (A) [to go to file 3BI5 BIT 1.]. The expression is in constant use. It has different meanings, but each is clear from the circumstances of the conversation. For example:

<i>A bit of luck, A bit of a break</i> The event is praised, its quality is genuine.

<i>A bit of a lark, A bit of fun</i>  There is no intense quality in the event.

<i>A bit of an ass, aren't you?</i>  The quality of the topic is weakened so that the remark will not sting as much.

<i>A bit of a hold-up (i.e. check to progress)</i>  The delay is brief.

<i>A bit of risk attached to it</i>  The proportion of risk is not great, possibly slight.

<i>A bit of a muddler, A bit of a no-hoper, A bit of a poor show </i> The quality referred to is present in full force.

Quote:  Exaggeration is not an Australian characteristic and appears mainly in slang ...; understatement shows in style and unemphatic intonation rather than in vocabulary, except for the ubiquitous <i>a bit. </i> <i>Ibid.</i> 126 [qoting a Queensland survey] The word <i>bit</i> is common because it occurs in<i> a bit</i> (169) ...,<i> a bit of</i> (142) ... The word <i>bit</i> (1,241) is thus very frequent; compare <i>two (1,253).. </i>
