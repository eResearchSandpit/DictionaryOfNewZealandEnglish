Quote:  The constant outflow of crushed quartz and water from the stamp boxes is received on a table, having on it grooves or ripples, containing quicksilver and a large extent of amalgamated copper plates smoothly nailed on. This may be called the silver table; ... The flow then passes over blanket tables, which arrest mechanically all the heavier particles.
