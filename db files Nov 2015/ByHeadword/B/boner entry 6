Quote:  In a gesture as censorial as that of [the] English teacher, the [<i>South China Morning Post</i>] declined to print the term "boner". replacing it with the less sexually offensive word "erection"... [23] "I mean, hang around with three 10-year-old boys for 15 minutes and you'll hear the word 'boner'. They talk about it constantly."
