Definition:ca1945 As a totalisator or betting convenience, to pair horses in certain circumstances so that if either is placed a dividend is paid on both. The circumstances are these: a) horses beyond 18 in any race are paired (bracketted) with a number, and hence a horse, already given (e.g. in a race of 20 entries, the last numbers would be 17, 17a, 18, 18a); b) similarly, when entries are more than can be safely run at one time and the race must be run in two divisions, each horse in the first division is paired (bracketted) with each horse in the second; c) (formerly) horses of the same ownership (galloping) or of the same ownership and trainership (trotting and pacing), running in the same race were bracketted.
