Quote:   Reaching the end of the walk, and things just going fair, he returned and again said to the tall Moree Myall, `You are still cutting too often - go easy,' but the light limbed Australian continued to strip the `Basil' from the unfortunate stud ewe he was shearing. Standing by, the Moree native engaged in taking off the trimmings around the udder, then deliberately swept the glistening steel of his razor shears across the teats of the stud ewe, and deliberately shore them off level with the belly line.
