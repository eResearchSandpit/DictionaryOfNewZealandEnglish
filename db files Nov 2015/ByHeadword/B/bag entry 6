Quote:  c1900] Sheets were placed under the [threshing] mill to catch any seed that leaked out and the bag hole men would dig out the bag hole so that the bags could be rammed full. ...

The usual gang for stack threshing [c1900] was 12 men. The boss kept steam up and attended to the mill adjustments and lubrication, three men worked in the bag hole, the bag-rammer, the bag-sewer, and the bag-carrier; two men were on top of the mill, a band cutter and a man to turn the sheaves to the band cutter.
