Quote:  With a darning needle and thread, ... they soon had a [104] five foot string of worms which they coiled into a bob and tied in several places. This was fastened with flax to a strong stick about six feet long. [early 20C.] We went down to the river about dusk, each of us with a rod, ... our bobs suspended in a deep pool.
