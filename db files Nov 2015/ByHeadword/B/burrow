Quote:  But, as the mutton-bird seldom makes a new burrow, but returns to the old ones year after year, and as these burrows are nearly horizontal, the natives have made vertical openings into them, through which they extract the young one. The hole thus made is closed up with a plug of grass, and serves for many years.
