Quote:  NEW ZEALAND BLACK FLOUNDER or RIVER FLOUNDER (PATIKI-MOHOAO)

<i>Rhombosolea (Adamsoma) retiaria adams </i>Whitley and Phillipps. It is known to fishermen and those in the fishing industry as the River Flounder as it is caught mostly inside or near the mouths of rivers and enters lakes where it lives chiefly among weeds. To some it is known as the Maori Flounder. I have helped to catch these fish in various rivers in New Zealand, Both in the North and South Islands, from the Bay of Islands, Bay of Plenty, Canterbury and Otago.
