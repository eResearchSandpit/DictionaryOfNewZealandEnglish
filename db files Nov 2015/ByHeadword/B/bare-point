Quote:  When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.
