Quote:  One thing everybody does know about the Coast is bait. Whitebait. That succulent little fish, quick and lucent, likened in an old haiku to  the `spirit of the waters'... When it's a good season, tons are lovingly packed into freezers against the lean, non-bait portion of the year.  <i>Ibid.</i> 38 Take half a pound of bait per person, add an egg (two eggs, if you really like them), stir vigorously until fish and egg is a viscous froth full of strange little eyes.
