Quote:  ... Native Land Court sittings were held there in the late 1890s and early 1900s.* [fn] These sittings were not of the court proper, but of `block committees' of chiefs responsible for parcelling out shares in land allocated to particular hapu in earlier court sittings presided over by a judge. The block committees' decisions were subsequently ratified by court.
