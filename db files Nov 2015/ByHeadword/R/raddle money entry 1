Quote:  This [South Island] shed is often said ... to have been paid for with `raddle money', a term that many of our younger shearers have never even heard. In those days ... a shearer had to shear cleanly, or have many of his sheep heavily marked in the count-out pens and excluded from his tally. Inevitably the boss stood to benefit from such a one-sided bargain, hence the term, raddle money.
