Quote:  Thick paper is used in the manufacture of ordinary ready-made cigarettes. It makes them look fresh longer, but it doesn't improve the taste. Make your own cigarettes with fresh tobacco and "A.G." Cigarette Paper - the thinnest of thin cigarette paper. You'll never want a ready-made cigarette again when you discover how much more you like your own.
