Quote:  In New South Wales, in 1813, this difficulty [of shortage of coin] became so acute that Governor Macquarie, in an effort to check the outflow of Spanish dollars, then the main circulating medium, caused the centres of these coins to be struck out, the centre-piece (about the size of a shilling) being stamped NEW SOUTH WALES, 1813, around a central crown, and on the other side FIFTEEN PENCE, the remainder or `ring' part of the dollar being impressed around the new inner rim with NEW SOUTH WALES, 1813 on one side, and FIVE SHILLINGS on the other. ... [67] 3,008 Dollars (mainly Holey or Ring Dollars) [pounds] 752 0 0/ 725 Dumps (centres of Spanish Dollars) 45 6 3
