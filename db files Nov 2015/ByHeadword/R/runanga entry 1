Quote:  It appears that the natives there are beyond all restraint. They have broken loose altogether, laugh at the idea of a Commissioner coming among them, refuse to suffer even the forms of enquiry, and use language so outrageous concerning the Queen, the Governor, and the white <i>runanga</i> as to be without a parallel in the country up to the present time.

Quote:  ... on one occasion [in the 1850s] during the sittings of the General Assembly, the outside of the house was beseiged by crowds of Natives, listening and wondering what the white people inside could possible be doing, and whether they were holding a secret meeting or runanga to kill the Maories! He [Mr. Rogan] remarks that at this time the Maories first adopted the term `runanga,' the term `komiti' having previously been used by them in respect to deliberative meetings.
