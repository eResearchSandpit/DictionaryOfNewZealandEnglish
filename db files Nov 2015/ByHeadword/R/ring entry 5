Quote:  Merino sheep on the flat, especially when coming to a gate, are apt to circle. The centre of the mob may stand still, or move slowly forward; but the outside sheep gallop round and round them. This is  called ringing. It is annoying to see the sheep racing past the gate instead of going through it, but the habit may be turned to the shepherd's advantage. By starting the sheep on one side ringing the reverse way, two streams of sheep can be made to meet at the gate, and carry one another through.
