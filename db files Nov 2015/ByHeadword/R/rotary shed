Quote:  In his new rotary shed, the cows step onto a slowly turning platform and have the cups attached ... When the cows have completed the circuit the cups are removed automatically, enabling Karl to milk 600 cows singlehandedly in an hour. <i>Ibid.</i> 38 I have just watched the afternoon milking of 350 cows. It took about an hour in a rotary shed that has more in common with the Sydney Opera House than with John Scott's old herringbone shed... One at a time, the cows boarded a huge, slow merry-go-round capable of holding 66 animals and stood side by side like slides in a carousel, heads facing the centre.
