Quote:  Dr John Dobson, a drug clinic consultant ..., says flunitrazepan, marketed as Rohypnol, is supposed to be a sleeping tablet. But it has become a favourite with pill popping addicts, and

`rolies' as they are known, sell on the street for up to $7 each. ... `It's the drug that druggies use.'
