Quote:  Telecom says plan to disband its four regional operating companies will not alter its Kiwi Share obligations... The Rocs are at the heart of the Kiwi Share - a statement enshrined in the company's articles of association when Telecom was sold to Bell Atlantic and Ameritech in 1990. It was an attempt by the then Labour government to protect the interests of the New Zealand public.
