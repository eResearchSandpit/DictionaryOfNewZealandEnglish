Quote:  In 1912 the federation pledged support for the disgruntled tramwaymen in Wellington, and the Evening Post made its contribution to history by declaring: `A victory for the Reds in the present quarrel would be a public disaster, possibly on a national scale. The Reds are out to fight ...' The tramwaymen struck and won, and henceforth that first Federation of Labour became known as the Red Federation and its leaders as Red Feds.
