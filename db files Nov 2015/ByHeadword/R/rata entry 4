Quote:  It is invariably erect and never climbing, although bushmen and settlers frequently state that it climbs the loftiest trees, and sooner or later squeezes them to death in its iron clasp. In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber. The error is simply due to imperfect observation, which has led careless observers to confuse [<i>M. scandens</i> the Aka], which is a true climber with <i>M. robusta</i>.

Quote:  <i>Rata, n.</i> Maori name for two New Zealand erect or sub-scandent flowering trees, often embracing trunks of forest trees and strangling them: the Northern Rata, <i> Metrosideros robusta </i> , A. Cunn., and the Southern Rata, <i> M. lucida </i> , Menz., both of the N.O. <i> Myrtacea </i> . The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i>  means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk).
