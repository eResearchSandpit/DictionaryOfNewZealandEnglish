Quote:  They reckoned he'd stuck to his religion all  through and the Hoons [fn Non religious groups.] gave me the impression that he took his religion seriously and to them he was a bit of a joke. You couldn't take much notice of the Hoons of course, not about a thing like that. Most of them just lumped the religoes together ... <i> Ibid.</i> 164 There was a sort of line drawn in the [detention] camps betwen the Hoons and the religoes. ... The religoes were divided again into God knows how many sects and amongst the hoons were absolute pacifists, pacifists, Communists, Anarchists, humanists, and plain dodgers.

<i>Ibid.</i> 215 The third group [in conscientious objectors' detention camps], the religoes, could hardly be called a group at all. It was a mixed bag of Methodists, Presbyterians, Brethren, Church of England and some Catholics.
