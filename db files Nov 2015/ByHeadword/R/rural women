Quote:  This month's re-branding of the former Women's Division Federated Farmers under a new name - Rural Women - is fantastic, says the Blenheim woman who thought up the name 15 years ago .. They used to think you had to be a farmer or a farmer's wife but Rural Women includes anybody that is interested in the rural sector.
