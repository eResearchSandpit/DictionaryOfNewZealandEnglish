Quote:  The Maoris used to fish there [mouth of Tukituki River, Hawke's Bay ca1897] with `reti' ... The reti consists of a canoe-shaped board about a foot long with a spinning bait attached with about four feet of strong line. The board is thrown into the current on its edge and is held against the current and allowed to drift out into the breakers, generally on about 100 yards of line. The moment a fish is struck the whole affair is brought in.
