Quote:   It is difficult to imagine how these two men could skirt, roll, class and carry away the 1600 or so fleeces shorn in a day. Two pressers were paid 1/- a bale.

Quote:  Regarding the respective values of the clips, it is hardly necessary to state that fleeces from March-shorn sheep were not able to be rolled. From them only stained wool and bellies were sorted out ... A star bale sold at a crutching sale made 101/4d., while a fadge of the same wool pooled later made 121/4 pence ..
