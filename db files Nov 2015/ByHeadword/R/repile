Notes: Jim writes: DNZE records the special NZ use of <i>pile</i> and <i>block</i> [or post] of wood or stone [or concrete] on which the underfloor beams of a building rest. It does not have entries for <i>repile</i> or <i>reblock</i>. These terms are in common use and often seen in ads for old houses e.g. "recently repiled", "needs some reblocking". "Repiling" is a heading in the Yellow Pages.
