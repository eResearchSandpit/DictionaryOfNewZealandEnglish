Quote:  Of course, the introduced, white-flowered convolvulus is not to be confused with our native convolvulus - raparaha or pohue - the small edible namesake of awesome Ngati Toa leader Te Rauparaha. According to the <i>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</i>, soon after Te Rauparaha's birth, a Waikato warrior who had killed and eaten a relation of his, threatened to eat the child as well, roasted with rauparaha leaves - and the child was named Te Rauparaha in defiance of this threat.

Quote:  Introduced white-flowered varieties [convolvulus]are not to be confused with our native convolvulus, rauparaha or pohue. This small edible plant gave its name to the awesome Ngati Toa leader, Te Rauparaha... A coastal plant, rauparaha has curled leaves in a rounded heart-shaped, quite thick and waxy, with pink striped  flowers of the distinctive morning glory form.
