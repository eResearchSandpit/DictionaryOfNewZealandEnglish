Quote:  Many quality New Zealand beers are never bottled and are only available on tap from the brewery or a bottle store in 1.25 or 2 litre plastic bottles (called variously riggers, flagons or PETs depending on where you are from). I headed off to Regional Wines, and Spirits with a bag of empty riggers to sample some of their beers on tap... While beer in a rigger will keep fresh for a short time, ideally it should be consumed within a day or two of purchase.
