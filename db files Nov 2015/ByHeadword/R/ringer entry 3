Quote:  POLICE believe several gangs of car ringers are active in Christchurch. They use identification plates and papers from wrecks to disguise stolen vehicles before resale....The ringers buy a late-model wreck written off by an insurance company and steal a similar car. The identification plates are then changed over and the stolen vehicle is sold as a rebuilt wreck.
