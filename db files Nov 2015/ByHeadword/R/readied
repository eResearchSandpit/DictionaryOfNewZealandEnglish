Quote:  Two men (strangers to each other) recently came out of the Police Court after listening to evidence in a case. Said one: `It looks like a "readied" case'; to which the other replied: `Yes.' They said no more and went their several ways; but the joke of the matter lies in the fact that it came out later that the first man intended to libel the police, while the second sought to libel the defence.
