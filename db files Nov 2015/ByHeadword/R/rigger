Quote:  I notice that the word `rigger' [in HNZD P.936] does not include the sense which used to be common, of a 1 litre JDKZ gin bottle filled at the pub with draft beer. I distinctly remember the notice at `His Lordships' a very scruffy tavern in St Asaph

St.Ch-ch `No jars or riggers filled after 5-45 pm.' This was deciphered by an elderly habitue for the innocent student.The word is apparently a contraction of the term `square rigger' used to describe a JDKZ bottle...  -->P: 5. `Quart of draught beer in square-faced gin bottle': Austr: ca 1918: (B 1942)
