Quote:  I thought at first that the Ringatu Church meant a church at Ringatu. If it means a religion I think we ought to pause before we endow a faith which may, for all we know, be most pernicious.

Quote:  Nearly all these people were Ringatus... Not many people know much about the Ringatu faith... I knew that Ringatu was the name for some sort of religion, for on Sundays the people gathered at the carved meeting house which was the Ringatu church and chanted long karakias, guided by one who was their Ringatu Minister.

Quote:  At the native meeting up the river the diversity of religions caused some discussion. There are four religions altogether, Protestant (Church of England), Catholic, Salvation Army, and Te Kooti's religion (Ringatu). The latter is a bugbear to some of the natives, particularly the Catholics, but the meeting decided on freetrade in this matter, the main argument being that as Englishmen had hundreds of religions there was no reason why the Maoris should not have at least four. .. The term Ringatu is, we understand, derived from the fact that in place of saying "Amen," as usual in other services, they say "Glory."
