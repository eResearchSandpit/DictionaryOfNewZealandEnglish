Quote:  We sat talking, then before she left, the Rawleigh Man called and he stayed until lunch time. He only calls once in six months, and when he does come, it's a major social event. <i>Ibid.</i>  183 RAWLEIGH MAN-A travelling representative of a firm specialising in household requirements ranging from prepared foods to laundry soaps. In country districts, and in towns too, the Rawleigh Man is an institution, not only because of the service he renders, but because he is invariably a cheerful fellow, a good companion to chat with over a cup of tea.
