Quote:  ... to say nothing of Korimako and Pitoitoi ... we never saw or heard the notes of either the Piopio, the Tieke, or the Hihi, all of which birds were at one time more numerous even than the Huia. The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

Quote:  <i>Acanthisitta chloris</i> Sparr. Rifleman. Owing to the uncertainty regarding the species denoted by the term `wren' as used by the average observer, many records which may apply to this species have been left strictly alone. In the Wellington District the grey warbler  (<i>Maorigerygone igata</i> Quoy & Gaim.) is often referred to in popular parlance as the `native wren.'
