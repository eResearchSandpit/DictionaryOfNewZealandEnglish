Quote:  The redheads we soon began catching for ourselves: smaller and less flavoursome than the inanga, the prized main whitebait variety (there are five in all), the redheads did indeed have a small flush of red colouring behind their heads. They also possess two sets of fins - all the better for climbing up waterfalls, and for climbing part-way up the sides of our bucket.
