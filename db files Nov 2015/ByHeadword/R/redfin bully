Quote:  Although whitebaiters know them by the name "whalefeed" they are in fact the young of several species of freshwater bully: the redfinned bully (<i>Gobiomorphus huttoni</i>), the bluegilled bully (<i>Gobiomorphus hubbsi</i>) and the common bully (<i>Gobiomorphus cotidianus</i>)... The redfinned bully is a handsome species, perhaps the most beautiful of New Zealand's freshwater fish.
