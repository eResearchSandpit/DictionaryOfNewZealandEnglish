Quote:  At the same time (c 1870s) the rusticated weatherboard made its appearance - the invention of it being attributed to Toxwood, who was an artichtect [sic] trained in Denmark. . .  In the days of the wooden rusticated house.. the wealth of the fortunate owner was  reflected in the character and elaboration of the external adornment. <i>Ibid.</i> 21 The plain rusticated wall with stops was the lowest degree; if quoins were mitred at the corners that was an indication of greater refinement; but for the highest type and the wealthier client the quoins must be ovolo molded.

Quote:  Another kind of weatherboard which became popular in the 1880's was the "rusticated" board, where the top edge was planed down to fit behind a rebate in the edge of the next board. The completed wall showed pronounced grooves which resembled channel-jointed stonework, and in more elaborate houses timber <i>quoins</i> at corners assisted the illusion. The introduction of the rusticated board has been attributed to the Wellington architect Julius Toxward in the 1860s.
