Quote:  [Colonialisms] A `remittancer' in Australia is a ne'er-do-well who has been sent out from England by his friends and receives a monthly remittance  as long as he [170] keeps away. No one will give a `remittancer' work if he can obtain anybody else to do it, and the remittancer generally spends his monthly allowance in three days, living very badly on credit till his money next arrives.)

Quote:  Another memory that lingered on the trip, was that from Napier to Gisborne, to inspect a property known as `Te Rapa' and nearby was a `pubbery' (certainly not a hotel, for anybody would wonder why the Licensed Victuallers Association ever granted a licence for meals or liquor to be dispensed), and was typically designated `The Trap'. Truly, this pubbery was just short of shanty, typical of the `Outer Barcoo', but where Maories, their Wahines, or broken down `Remittancers' could drown their sorrows, wander into the `arms of Bacchus' or chase pink elephants.
