Quote:   The right-whale porpoise (<i>Lissodelphis peroni</i>) can be at once recognized by the absence of a dorsal fin. It possesses a distinct beak, and about 44 pairs of small pointed teeth. The colouring is distinctive: the back is black, and this colour is sharply marked off from the under-parts, which are white, the line between the two passing above the tail, flippers, and snout.
