Quote:  [A 15-year-old writes] Finally, I don't turn up my nose at flash new clothes that my relations give me. As I said before, I'm not into some gears, so I just give them to Mum, who's my size too. (My mum's a bit of a rager.) So please elders, don't generalise. All teenagers aren't the same. We're different in our own ways.
