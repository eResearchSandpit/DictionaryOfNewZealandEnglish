Quote:  I can't begin to tell you how passionately some people feel about the Reserve Bank Act 1889... However, since the RBA was passed, both National and Labour politicians have sworn allegiance to it with the sort of fervour that Americans reserve for their flag... The RBA sets out how our central bank is to be run...
