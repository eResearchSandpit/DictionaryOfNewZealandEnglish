Quote:  Mr Punch... abjures (?or abhors - check) all contact with "filthy lucre" but he will accept instead.. any amount of the following substitutes, that is to say - any amount of  "the rhino", "the ready", "the stumpy", "the brads", "the tin", "the brass", "the dumps", "the rowdy", "the shiners", "the mopusses" (wherewith people buy diamonds and topazes).
