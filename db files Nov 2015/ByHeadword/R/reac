Quote:  The most intransigent opposition to Te Roopu Rapu's continuance came from the Department of Labour and local Regional Employment Access Council, which approves funding of Access schemes.  According to minutes of an interdepartmental meeting on November 20, chaired by Reac chairwoman Pat Harrison, Labour Department district superintendent ... said that a statement ... `that funding by Reac ... was embarrassing'.
