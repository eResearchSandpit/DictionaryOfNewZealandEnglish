Quote:  <i>Way (w&amacr.), n. [Add.]

Right of way. [Add.] (b) (Pl., RIGHT OF WAYS.) A narrow street; a lane.

[Australia] </i> This use of the legal term in a concrete sense originated in Melbourne. In laying out the city, passages ten or twelve feet wide were left between the large rectangular lots. These passages ran from one broad street to another and were intended to afford a

<i>right of way</i> between the lots. Hence the term came to be applied to the passages themselves.
