Notes: RED-PINE (Cook's <i>Spruce</i>) a forest tree, and its timber: see also IMOU  Rimu is used in North Island, and in Nelson and Marlborough and  Westland. <i>Red-pine</i> has been used chiefly in Central Otago (for the tree) and Southland, and (for the timber) in Otago and Canterbury. <i>Rimu</i>  seems to be replacing <i>Red-pine</i> as a tree-name even in the Southern South Island. Rimu is universally known, but not universally used. Morris (1896) remarks that <i>Rimu</i> generally used in North Island, <i>Red-pine</i> more generally in the South.
