Quote:  `A game played by rolling a tennis ball into holes each occupied by a player, who, if the ball gets into his hole, tries to `brand' the roller. Possibly a game peculiar to our school.'

Quote:  In small schools without proper playing fields, games were spontaneous and enjoyable, and holes could be dug freely in the school grounds for Rotten Eggs, in which a tennis ball is rolled into the nest of one of the players and all run while the boy with the ball has to brand another player (i.e. hit him with the ball).
