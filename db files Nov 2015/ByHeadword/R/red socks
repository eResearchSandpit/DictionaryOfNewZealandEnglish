Quote:  First it was the virgin in a condom. Now an artist has done something extraordinary with that symbol of yachting good luck, the red sock. He put it on the penis of a carved Maori warrior.

Quote:  Whose idea was the America's Cup red sock campaign?... This was one of those promotional success stories that took off when Kiwis bought numerous red socks to suppport the New Zealand team on the water in 1995... English journalist Jane Redford casually remarked to someone that skipper Peter Blake always aseemed to be wearing red socks when the team did well. Some marketing whiz-kid at TVNZ put two and two together and came up with way more than four; thousands of pairs of patriotic pinky-warmers flew off the production line.
