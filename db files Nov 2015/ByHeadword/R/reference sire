Quote:  Some reference sires are used in successive years to create genetic links, which allows EBVs to be compared across years. Other reference sires are replaced by superior rams, identified by their across-flock EBVs. Thus the reference sires have a dual role, creating genetic links across flocks and years and producing more rapid dissemination of genetic improvement.
