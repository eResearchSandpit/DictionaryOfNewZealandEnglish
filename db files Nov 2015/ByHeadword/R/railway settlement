Quote:  [Hdg] Life in the Ngaio Railway Settlement 1930-1940... My father worked for the New Zealand Railways and my first five years were at Waipukurau the Railway Settlement there. In 1930 my father turned our family up-side-down when he announced "we are shifting to the Railway Settlement in Ngaio."
