Quote:  KOKOPU (<i> Galaxias fasciatus</i>). ... `Kokopu,' Dr. Hector says, `is the general Maori name for several very common fishes in the New Zealand streams and lakes, belonging to the family of <i> Galaxidae</i>. ... The kokopu of the stream is caught by them with bobs; but is not much cared for. Not more, as a rule, than one or two fish will be found in a pool; half a dozen at the most. It is also called rawaru and para.

Quote:  The above list of fish to be caught along the Canterbury coast has some notable omissions, as hoka (red cod) ... though I am not so sure about the rawaru (blue cod). Others omitted are the tarakihi, or terakihi, the moki, the komutumutu (trevalli), the puhaiwhakarua (red-jacket), koiro (conger eel), tuere (blind eel), whai (skate), and the koekohe [sic] (trumpeter).
