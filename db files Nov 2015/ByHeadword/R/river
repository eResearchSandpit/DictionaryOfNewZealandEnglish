Notes: [see also ?Eaddy GRAVEYARD (?Kaipara)] -->R. Mason notes: in Auckland Province narrow harbours or arms of harbours, mostly on the west coast are often called rivers, and were so named on older maps and in writings. They are in fact formed by the drowning of river systems. [nf in this sense OED, EDD, W3] -->On old maps: The Whangape River, The Herekino River, The Hokianga River; on present-day maps, The Waiuku River. At the present time [1957] the local inhabitants refer to the Hokianga Harbour as `the river', as do the people of Herekino to the Herekino harbour. Jane mander's novel  The Story of a New Zealand River refers to the Kaipara harbour, I understand. Various arms of kaipara and Hokianga are still named `rivers' on present maps. In Waitemata Harbour, the Whau River; and other branches also rivers.

Quote:  A river in New Zealand, from twenty to forty miles in length in a direct course, often flows in serpentine directions nearly three times that length; the salt-water rivers are joined at their entrances by fresh-water creeks, many of which pursue routes inland, through perhaps eighty miles of country.
