Quote:  Mair Fish in Piako River ... <i>large numbers of aua or kataha</i> (Agonostoma forsteri); <i>about 60 lb. ... weight of pilchard or mohimohi  (Clupea sagax)</i>, two varieties; ... hundreds of young  red-cod, rarii (<i>Lotella bacchus</i>), and what I believe are  young rock-cod, or kokopu or rawaru (<i>Percis colias</i>). The red-cod were from 3 in. to 4 in. in length, and the rawaru, or, as the natives here call them, `toitoi' or `panepane', from 2 in. to 6 in. long.
