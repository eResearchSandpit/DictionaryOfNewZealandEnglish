Quote:  Kiwis have this thing about vertical rubber experiences. They can't wait to leap from bridges with an elastic band on their feet, fling themselves from aircraft with pros strapped to their back like copulating dragonflies, jump into underground rivers with rubber rings around their middles, "rap jump" - abseil down the outer walls of high-rise buildings - and "zorb", roll down hills inside transparent rubber spheres... Even tiny Takaka not only has bungee jumping but serious "swinging", the latest in fear fads involving a 60 mph, 50 yd flight over an abyss.
