Quote:  The natives distinguish the bird as Tau-hou (which means stranger), or Kanohi-mowhiti (which may be interpreted as spectacle-eye or ring-eye). It is also called Poporoke and Iringatu, names suggested by its accidental or periodical occurrence. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/82 By the settlers it [sc  Zosterops] has been variously designated as Ring-eye, Wax-eye, White-eye, or Silver-eye, in allusion to the beautiful circlet of satiny-white feathers which surrounds the eyes; and quite as commonly as the `Blight-bird', or `Winter Migrant'.

Quote:  <i>tauhou</i>, a wandering bird (Zosterops halmaturina), blight-bird; twinkie; button-eye; wax-eye; ring-eye. Tauhou means stranger and this name was given by the Maori when the bird appeared, in 1856, in the central part of New Zealand, gradually spreading north and south till the islands were occupied. It is an Australian bird, and was blown across the Tasman sea in the year mentioned.
