Quote:  If [the freshers] did not please [at the initiation ceremony of the students' hostel] the dread chant of reamers would rise and off would come the trousers ... [84] Conformity was the [University hostel] House Code. A room mate was always a wife, trousers were always reamers, old boy was always pronounced air bair, the board at the bottom of the bed was the power board, a shower was a soak, all other hostels were inhabited by morons, freshers answered the phone.  -->Check P: OED
