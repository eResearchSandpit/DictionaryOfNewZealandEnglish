Notes: Jim Cameron writes : Historical 1846-1893. Shorn of administrative duties, resident magistrates were metamorphosed into <i>stipendiary magistrates</i> in the 1890s and legal qualifications were required. The term is not unique to NZ; there were resident magistrates in Ireland and elsewhere, but never in England. They played a significant part in NZ History which is recounted in Aland Ward <i>A Show of Justice</i> (1974). Not recorded in DNZE or other dictionaries, except perfunctorily (without definition) in NSOD.

Quote:  Resident magistrates, especially in frontier districts, were agents of government as well as having judicial functions. Towards the end of the nineteenth century resident magistrates lost their administrative functions and their office was metamorphosed into the purely judicial one of stipendiary magistrate.    Generally  known  simply  as magistrates (or SMs) they were legally qualified and exercised increasingly important judicial functions in magistrates courts
