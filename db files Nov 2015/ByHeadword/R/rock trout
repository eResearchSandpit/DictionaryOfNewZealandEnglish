Quote:  It is interesting to note that this fish belongs to the same family (Galaxiidae) as the common kokopo, or New Zealand rock trout, and the inanga (the parent of the New Zealand whitebait), but has been placed in a separate genus (Neochanna) on account of the absence of the paired ventral fins, which characteristic occurs, on the contrary, in all species of the genus Galaxias.

Quote:  Panako - The collector [sc Beattie] asked a Maori about this fish, as it was a new name to him, and received the reply: `The panako is the rock trout, and is nearly extinct. It looks like the kokopara in shape, but it is black in colour.'

Quote:  MINNOW or WHITEBAIT (INANGA) <i>Austrocobitis attenuatus </i>(Jenyns) ... For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.
