Quote:  They [cool TV newsreaders] were symbols of a benign paternalism that paraded the daily doses of murder, mayhem and Muldoonism past us and wordlessly reassured us: `There, there, it won't really hurt you. ...'  Whatever did happen to that old comfortable world; has it all been Rogernomicised out of existence?  Happily no. What we used to call social justice and now term wimpishness still lives.
