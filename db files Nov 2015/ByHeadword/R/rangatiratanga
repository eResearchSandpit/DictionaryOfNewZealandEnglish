Quote:  Rangatiratanga is a collective concept. You can't sell your rangatiratanga. In the Treaty of Waitangi, the word "rangatiratanga" appears in article 2. It is translated as "ownership" in the English version. Maori are guaranteed their rangatiratanga over lands, forests and fisheries.

Quote:  Judging from his speeches to the natives, it would appear that it is their absolute independence he requires - nay the "rangatiratanga," the chieftanship for Israel, who are the Maoris, over the Gentiles, who are the Europeans, in the Parihaka vocabulary.

Quote:  Some time before we came to Taupo a handsome `Pataka' (viz. a Maori store for food) had been burned. Sir George Grey when on his visit to Taupo saw the said Pataka and told Te Heuheu (no doubt in a jocose way) that it was a sign of his `Rangatiratanga.'

Quote:  The Principle of Self-Management The Rangatiratanga Principle The iwi have the right to organise as iwi, and, under the law, to control their resources as their own. <i>Ibid.</i> 11

The New Zealand Maori Council has explained the concept of Rangatiratanga as meaning more

than `possession':  `it means the wise administration of all the assets possessed by a group for that group's benefit: in a word, trusteeship'  (Te Wahanga Tuatahi, 1983, p 5)  In the Crown's view, the First and Second Articles of the Treaty are both strong statements which necessarily

qualify one another. Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect  Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... It is the right of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or Kawanatanga in such matters.
