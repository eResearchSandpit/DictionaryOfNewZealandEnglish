Quote:  We hear a lot these days about the so-called "Rogernomics", a name derived from the so-called "Reagonomics", which in turn is shorthand for "supply-side economics". Both these and "Thatchernomics" ultimately derive their inspiration from the dreaded "Friedmanite monetarism" which does not.. have anything to do with a hectoring American economist who is keen on the works of Monet, but instead has everything to do with a hectoring American economist who has, over the last 10 years, thrown millions of people out of work throughout the Western world.

Quote:  In 2002, Colin James argued that Helen Clark's government was operating during a period of consolidation, smoothing out some of the most glaring social inequalities created by the 1984-92 policy revolution, while consolidating the key economic changes of Rogernomics and Ruthanasia.

Quote:  Take "Rogernomics". for instance. The term was born on February 23, 1985, as a headline on a <i>Listener</i> interview with Roger Douglas. The following week it was picked up by Bernard Lagan in the <i>Dominion</i> and went on from there to enter the language as a term for mad dog monetarism, Kiwi style.

Quote:  At the heart of the discontent was "Rogernomics" - the popular word for the economic approach of Roger Douglas. Rogernomics deregulated where Muldoon had regulated, turned over to market forces those whom Muldoon had subsidised, cut taxes where Muldoon had raised them, subjected employers and unions to the painful wage discipline of controls on the money supply, exposed Muldoon's State departments to the market by turning trading operations into corporations, and requiring some other departments to earn part of their keep by selling their services.

Quote:  Mike Lee sees these ideas as another example of "Roger politics", the phrase coined by Auckland University's Professor Richard Mulgan to describe, as Lee puts it, "the erosion of democratic organisations or their abolition - such as harbour boards, power boards, hospital boards - and the consequent diminishing of public involvement."
