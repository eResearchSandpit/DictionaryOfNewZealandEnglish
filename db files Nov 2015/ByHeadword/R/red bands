Quote:  Skellerup Red Bands celebrate 50 years as a cultural icon.[hdg] Launched in 1958, the Red Band broke away from previous gumboot designs - it was wider than a normal gumboot, shorter in the leg and able to be 'stepped into' easily.

Quote:  Fonterra chairman Henry van der Heyden got the equivalent of a knighthood - a DCNZM .. but it wasn't for him.. "It didn't take me long to realise that this isn't about me," he told the NZ Herald. "This is a recognition of all the hard work that the farmers have done .." Well, he would say that wouldn't her Most people seem to, seeing as it's the Kiwi way to be humble or, at least, profess to be. It's that or to be thought to be too big for your red bands.

Quote:  The red-band rule of thumb (a waterway that is deeper than a red-band gumboot or too wide to jump) allows for a farmer to opt out of planting these crucial small streams. On most farms, even a large river narrows to the point where it could be stepped across. Similarly there will be a wide point where even a larger river can be crossed wearing red-bands.
