Quote:  reader: Literacy is assumed, but not required for this position, an academic rank corresponding with a U.S. PROFESSOR (who is not a department head). Another misleading N.Z. name for the same rank is Associate Professor. For those familiar with the English academic system a Reader in N.Z. is not the same as a Reader in England; as it is a teaching position in N.Z. rather than a research title as in England.
