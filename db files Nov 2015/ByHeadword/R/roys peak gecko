Quote:  The data collected during the three surveys of Roys Peak and outlined in this report provide only limited data on distribution. However, it appears Roys Peak geckos are an alpine gecko, as all specimens were found above 1000 m, and below this altitude common geckos <i>Hoplodactylus ` Southern Alps'</i> (Hitchmough 1997) were numerous.
