Quote:  I have fixed up a bail at the end of the race, or crush pen. One side of the race at the bail is formed by a strong gate, which is opened when the cow is bailed for milking. So soon as the cow has entered the race a bar is slipped in behind her across the race, and another bar is slipped across behind her when close up to the bail.

Quote:  Another feature of the plan before us is that instead of one gate at the end of the race, there are two, which when open are parallel with the sides of the race, giving a passage between them into a yard for lambs, while the opening of either gate closes this passage and opens a space sufficient to allow a single sheep to pass either into a yard for ewes or wethers.
