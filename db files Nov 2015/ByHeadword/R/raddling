Quote:  I did not brand the bales, but marked them with raddle, and if there were two sorts I would mark them so. I have sometimes known mistakes between the raddling and branding; with a large lot and different men mistakes might easily arise.

Quote:  Raddling.-An old-time shed practice, whereby the shed boss put a raddle-mark on any sheep in the counting-out pen not shorn to his satisfaction, and the shearer was not paid for it. Old hands often spoke of this practice. I think the great shearers' strike at the beginning of the 'nineties ended it.

Quote:  In 1886 there is mention of `raddling' (and not paying for) badly shorn sheep. I think by the 'nineties the shearers had managed to get this custom abolished.
