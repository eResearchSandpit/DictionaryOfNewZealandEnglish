Quote:  From the air, Rangitoto's 258 m high sunmmit looks more like a green poached egg than a rugged volcanic cone. Molten lava spewed from around the crater as recently as 600 years ago and plenty of raw rock is still visible between the clumps of encroaching trees. While the eruptions left Rangitoto with a black and scaly skin, ash deposited on neighbouring Motutapu Island.. smoothed the topography and endowed it with up to two metres of rich topsoil. <i>Ibid.</i> 24 ...[Tamatekapua's] fate endures in the island's full name - "Te Rangi I Totongia A Tametakapua" or "the day the blood of Tametekapua was shed"... The early eruptions of Rangitoto were the most ferocious, driven by seawater flashing steam as it encountered fresh magma at 1200 degrees C.
