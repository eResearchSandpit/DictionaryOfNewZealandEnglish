Quote:  Kawau's fourth and most exotic wallaby species, the brush-tailed rock wallaby, or "rocky", may number around 1000. Rockies stick to the Kawau cliffs, occasionally making their way up coastal gullies to forage. This striking orange and chocolate brown-coloured wallaby even scuttles up sloping puriri trunks.
