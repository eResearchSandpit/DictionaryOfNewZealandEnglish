Quote:  Blairich is one of the stations that used to get the 'River Gang' to do its mustering .. like the Flying Gang in the Hanmer Spring district they did just the actual mustering, moving on from place to place as the hill work was completed. They covered a tremendous amount of country, all hard going, and the River Gang was widely known.
