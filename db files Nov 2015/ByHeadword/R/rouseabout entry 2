Quote:  Their mode of living is on the strict hand-to-mouth principle; the future is a disagreeable prospect, which they endeavour to ignore, content if the present affords them a fair modicum of enjoyment; big cheques are earned, but they are melted with much greater celerity; and so the round of life goes on from year to year, until old age finds them still on the wallaby, burdened with aches and pains, unfitted for the only work of which they know anything, and glad to accept the billet of a farm yard "rouseabout," or "wood and water Joey."
