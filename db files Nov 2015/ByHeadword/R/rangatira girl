Quote:   [quotation marks enclose Chapman's original] Unable to bear the solitary life, not a few acquired `Maori wives', which was `the conventional name for a Maori mistress'. The native women often welcomed the squatters with bouquets of flowers and became very attached to their young men. The high-born Rangitira girls were sometimes richly beautiful, displaying a lithe elastic figure, soft brilliant eyes and rose brown complexions, set off by glossy black hair falling to the knees.
