Quote:  A specimen of this rather rare fish [<i>Physiculus (Lotella) rhacinus</i> (Forster)] was captured off Cape Saunders early in 1924, and kept in captivity for several months. Before its death my curiosity was aroused by one of the staff calling it a `rock-cod' and stating that that was the name used in the north even where the `blue-cod' <i>Parapercis colias</i> was also caught.

Quote:  ROCK COD or SOUTHERN HAKE <i>Lotella rhacina</i> (Bloch and Schneider) Up to 1891 this fish was universally known to scientists and fishermen as Hake, then for some unknown reason E. R. Waite (<i>Records of the Canterbury Museum</i>, Vol. 1, No. 3) transferred the name Hake to <i>Merluccius gayi</i>, with Whiting as a second alternative common name. ... The most common name among Otago fishermen was Rock Cod, because this fish favours a rocky habitat.
