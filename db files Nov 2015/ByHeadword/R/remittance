Quote:  This inn - the Wakatu - is the most disorderly and uncomfortable house that we have seen in the colonies. It is frequented by young men of some education with a little money, and whilst their money lasts they give themselves up to riot and excess. They are probably such as their friends in England are glad to send to a distance and as if to confirm their ruin supply them with a small income. As soon as this is squandered they go to the Wairau as shepherds ... Here they remain in obscurity till their remittance brings them again to the Wakatu.
