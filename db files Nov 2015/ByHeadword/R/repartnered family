Quote:  Which is one of the reasons why Rodwell prefers a different term : repartnered families...

The book, Repartnered Families: Creating new ways of living together - beyond the nuclear family, was originally prompted by what she was seeing in her work.. in interviews as a family therapist.. She presents different ways that repartnered families live together... The term repartnering is one not everybody is comfortable with.
