Quote:  A wonderful word finding increasing currency is <i>rark</i> .Most people know what it means, but no one knows where it came from. When a person is <i>rarked up</i>, he's unaware the information he is being fed is phoney. Those in the know are giggling behind their hands while the victim gets angrier and angrier.
