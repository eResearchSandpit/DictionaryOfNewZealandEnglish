Quote:  Riffles: The diagonal, lengthwise or cross pieces or grooves in sluices which catch the heavier metallic particles allowing the clay and sand to pass. The value of the wash up is determined by the amount of gold or other metal caught in the riffles or other devices.

Quote:  RIFFLE OR RIPPLE: both terms were used for the grooves cut across the bottom of a sluice-box or for the much more common wooden bars fixed at right angles, obliquely, or lengthwise, to the bottom of a sluice. The `riffleboard' was detachable and formed a `false bottom'. `Riffle' was probably a Californian term; `ripple' seems to have been more usual on the goldfields of Australasia.
