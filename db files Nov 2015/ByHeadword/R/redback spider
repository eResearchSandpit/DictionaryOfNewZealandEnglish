Quote:  ...it may be prudent to mention that the Australian red-back spider (<i>Latrodectus hasselti</i>) has become firmly established in New Zealand in the last couple of years, so we can deal with three closely related comb-footed spider species in the space of one story... In other words, the black widow is really nothing more than the American katipo, and the red-back is the Australian katipo.
