Quote:  Those Wanganui cricketers who formed the team that visited Nelson in 1873 will regret the news contained in the following telegram from Nelson dated Friday last:- "Yesterday afternoon an inquest was held at Wakefield on the body of Melville Sellon, who was a runowner, and well known a few years since as a crack cricketer ..."

Quote:  When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.'  The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Quote:  Jack was advised that it would be to his future benefit, probably, if he could obtain employment on a station; and among his letters of introduction was one to Mr John Campbell, a small runowner at a station some five miles or so from Riversdale, which, as everyone knows, is on the Gore-Lumsden line of railway.
