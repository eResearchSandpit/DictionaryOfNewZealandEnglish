Quote:  <i>GOLDEN SNAPPER Centroberyx affinis (Trachichthodes affinis) </i>(Nannygai, red snapper, koarea) ... In spite of its name the golden snapper is not related to the true snapper and is in fact more similar to the roughys. ... Schools of golden snapper often move out over open sand flats ... and are then regularly caught in bottom trawls and sold as red fish.
