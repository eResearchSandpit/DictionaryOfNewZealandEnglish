Quote:  ... the latter is always skirted and classed, whereas the black fleece was rolled up just as taken from the sheep's back, the belly-pieces being also left in. ... For example, white wool divides, when skirted by the roller at the wool-table, thus: Belly pieces, say, 6d. per pound; first pieces, 8d. per pound; ... fragments or locks, 4d. per pound.
