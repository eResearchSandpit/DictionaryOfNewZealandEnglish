Quote:  At the native meeting up the river the diversity of religions caused some discussion. There are four religions altogether, Protestant (Church of England), Catholic, Salvation Army, and Te Kooti's religion (Ringatu). The latter is a bugbear to some of the natives, particularly the Catholics, but the meeting decided on freetrade in this matter, the main argument being that as Englishmen had hundreds of religions there was no reason why the Maoris should not have at least four. .. The term Ringatu is, we understand, derived from the fact that in place of saying "Amen," as usual in other services, they say "Glory."

Quote:  I thought at first that the Ringatu Church meant a church at Ringatu. If it means a religion I think we ought to pause before we endow a faith which may, for all we know, be most pernicious.

Quote:  That's describing the place as it was in the early 1900s, when it was basically a Maori-speaking Ringatu community that didn't have a cash economy at all, just lived off the land, growing their own fruit and vegetables, and taking fish out of the estuary and out of the sea.
