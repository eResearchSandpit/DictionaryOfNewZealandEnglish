Quote:   Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, [?HWO thus <i>N. menziesii</i>] but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.
