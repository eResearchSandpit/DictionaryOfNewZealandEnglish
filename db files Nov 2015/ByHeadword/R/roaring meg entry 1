Quote:  There are now several bonnie burns coming down the mountain sides to the river, the largest of which are the famous Roaring Meg and Gentle Annie; and a visitor ... may wash his colours of gold from almost anywhere while his wee wife boils the billy. <i>Ibid.</i> 53  ... Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few miles further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself.
