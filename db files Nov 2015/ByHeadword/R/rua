Quote:  Their chief quest was a pot hole which might be described as much like a Maori rua or potato pit. A soft seam of rock played on by the tumbling waters and some stones always on the grind and move, wore down and sideways till the top was smaller than the bottom and an arched roof was the result, and a small opening at the top received through the ages particles of gold. The heavy swirl and pressure of water was unable to twist the gold contents out of the pot hole, and so a store of gold collected in the bottom and might contain nuggets as well as dust.
