Quote:  raddled: This word means `robbed' in the sense of being deprived of one's proper payment. It is an extension of `raddling', carried out by unscrupulous farmers before the Shearers' Union looked after shearers' interests. Any sheep considered unsatisfactorily shorn was marked with red or blue raddle and such a sheep would not be counted in the shearer's

tally. The raddle stick was also called a `Toby'. This must not be confused with [27] marking a sheep for other purposes, such as identification of certain sheep for easy selection later.
