Quote:  The tobacco may be put in wire cages or gunny bags, and allowed to boil ten minutes, 400 gallons at once, in malt tanks, the lids being on; but the best plan is to infuse under pressure of steam from a boiler, a pipe from which would heat the dip in the morning and regulate the temperature afterwards, which with newly shorn sheep should be 115 to 118 deg., and in rough sheep 120 to 125 deg. About 1 minutes for shorn and 2 for rough sheep should be effectual.

Quote:  Rough Sheep: Domesticated sheep which has escaped musterers and has gone semi-wild. Distinct from the real wild sheep of  Canterbury, and unlike them do not shed their wool. Consequently they become overburdened with wool, which at times reached such length that it drags on the ground <i>Ibid.</i> Wayleggo 29  ... Catching stragglers and rough sheep. <i>Ibid.</i> 154  These sheep were real wild sheep - not the ordinary domestic sheep gone wild. The latter, long-tailers and woolies which have escaped muster and gone semi-wild, are known as `rough sheep'
