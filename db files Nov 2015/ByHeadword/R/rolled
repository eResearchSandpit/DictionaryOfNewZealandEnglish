Quote:  .. I instructed my men to dig for gold; we found, to use a technical expression, `the colour everywhere'. They were generally thin, small scales, often only slightly rolled, and could not, therefore have been brought any distance. <i>Ibid.</i> 85 The wash gold is fine, scaly, and very much rolled, so that there is no doubt it has come some distance in the great river-bed.
