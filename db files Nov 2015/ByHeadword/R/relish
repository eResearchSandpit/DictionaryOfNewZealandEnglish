Quote:  Relish can also be used in a generic sense to mean a spoonful of something tasty served to enhance a plain food, although in New Zealand a relish is usually a sweetened savoury preserve made of chopped or grated vegetables - occasionally fruit - in which the vegetables retain some firmness of texture. Therefore, you could say that a New Zealand relish is a type of pickle, or that a New Zealand pickle is a type of relish.
