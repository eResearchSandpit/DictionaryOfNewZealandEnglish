Notes:  ROCK-HOPPING One of the most exciting, dangerous and rewarding types of fishing is undoubtedly rock-fishing. The rock-hopper gets added spice in his fishing by his sometimes death-defying attempts to get to the best possie and also to retrieve the fish from a low ledge before the next wave.
