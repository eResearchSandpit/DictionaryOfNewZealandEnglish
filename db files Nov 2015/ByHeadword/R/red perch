It is known in Australia as the `Bastard Long-fin', a name probably associated with its long dorsal fin. It is also known as the `Red Snapper', `St. Peter's Fish' or `Butterfly Perch'. It probably received the name of `St. Peter's Fish' on account of the two black marks, one on each side of the body, which suggest the thumb/and finger marks of St. Peter, as I have previously explained in the case of the John Dory.
