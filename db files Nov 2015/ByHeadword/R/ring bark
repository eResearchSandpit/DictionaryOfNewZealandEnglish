Quote:  The idea is to ringbark the trees and bore through the trunk with an augur a couple of holes which are filled with a composition and plugged. The composition soaks into the wood, rots it, and causes it to become inflammable. In about eight or ten months a match is applied, and the tree falls, the stump and roots which have become soaked with the mixture, being burned right out.
