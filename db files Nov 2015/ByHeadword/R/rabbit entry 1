Quote:  He [a six foot seven inch player] was chasing the smallest member of the [football] club, who was running with the ball; when close up to his quarry, the little fellow `rabbited' him. The giant went sprawling and the little fellow jumped up and continued his run amid roars of laughter from the spectators.
