Quote:  I did not brand the bales, but marked them with raddle, and if there were two sorts I would mark them so. I also sent tickets describing the wool. I have sometimes known mistakes between the raddling and branding; with a large lot and different men mistakes might easily arise.

Quote:  Raddle in those days [1880's] was in great demand, and when the boss of the board was in a bad humor [sic] or perchance did not like the color of the shearer's hair he used the raddle on the sheep shorn by the shearer and the raddle sheep were counted out and the shearer not paid for them.
