Quote:  At noon we stopped at a small settlement called Kiatoka, where we made a meal of some <i>tuies</i> toasted in the leaf of a tree called <i>herarekau</i>, these leaves will not burn, and they are wrapped round the bird so that none of the fat can escape, the bird cooked in this manner is really very delicious.

Quote:  We had some eels for breakfast, cooked in a way which was new to most of us, called kohe or kope, and which is done in the following manner:- fern stalks are run down the whole length of the fish (which is not skinned or in any way prepared for cooking) from the mouth to the tail - then two eels thus skewered are wrapped in leaves of the raurekau tree, and tied together with flax, when they are roasted before the fire with one end resting on the ground and the other leaning against a stick supported in a horizontal position in front of the fire for the purpose.
