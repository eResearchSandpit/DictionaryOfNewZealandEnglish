Quote:  It was risky swimming them over the rivers. If the cattle fail to make for the opposite bank the leaders may turn back and start `ringing' in midstream, the cattle in the middle of the ring being forced under water and drowned. At first it is difficult to get a clean swim-over; but the mob soon gets used to it.

Quote:  To drive stock to Auckland it was necessary to cross the river twice ... The danger of swimming the stock across was that they might `ring', that is swim round and round in the centre of the water till exhausted and then drown.
