Quote:  A staff member who has been away on leave for a while came back today and he said Rotovegas was the name of a country music band based in Rotorua that was set up by Sid Hughes in the 1980s. They were playing around with names for the band and came up with Rotovegas.  I have not been able to find anything yet to confirm this - unfortunately we have not indexed the Daily Post for the 1980s yet.
