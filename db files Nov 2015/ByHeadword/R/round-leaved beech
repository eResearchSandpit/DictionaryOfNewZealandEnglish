Quote:  With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri,</i> entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii</i>, round-leaved beech.
