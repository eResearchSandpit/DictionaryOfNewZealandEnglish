Quote:  A digger comes up here [to Grahamstown], say from the West Coast,/ To go out prospecting, .../ .../ Discovers a reef, and his fortune is made./ .../ He rides in a carriage, race-horses he buys,/ And the people who fawn on this reefer the most,/ Would have turned up their nose at him on the West Coast./
