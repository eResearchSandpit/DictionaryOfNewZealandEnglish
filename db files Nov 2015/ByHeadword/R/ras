Quote:  The Royal Agricultural Society of New Zealand (RAS) promotes the development of agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, stock-raising and forestry resources in New Zealand. ... The RAS of NZ is a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth, which offers benefits to life members attending overseas Royal Shows. ... While the RAS was instigated at a time in New Zealand when farming and related activities were considered to be the dominant way of life, it is an organisation that is still very relevant today.
