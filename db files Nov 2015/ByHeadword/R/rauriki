Quote:  Snails, meaning the shellback tribe, do not harbour under weeds so much as slugs, but they shelter among such things as cabbages, and large weeds like rauriki; but look for them more beneath hedges.

Quote:  <i> Sowthistle </i>. Here I note a case of what is called `folk etymology'. I hear this native plant (and introduced weed) as `sour thistle'. The speaker mistrakenly supposes the plant to be named from its taste. It is actually edible and much used by the Maoris as rauriki, corruptly `radicky'.

Quote:  If he were sure he could recognise it, writes Mr T. P. Moloney, he would gather rauriki and get his wife to cook it, for he enjoyed it years ago in Maori cooking, in the King Country, where it was called by the pakeha `Maori cabbage.'  <i> Rauriki </i> is the common succulent thistle, growing 2ft to 3ft high, that the children gathering it for pet rabbits and guinea pigs, call milk thistle, because of the abundant flow of milky white sap from it. Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i>  According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite.

Quote:  At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.'
