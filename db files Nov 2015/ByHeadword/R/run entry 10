Quote:  Run.- The pioneers of sheep farming in New Zealand and Australia came from various classes; but there were few among them who had been sheep farmers before and fewer still who were scientists. If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all  this is the word run.

Quote:  [Cont] (1) The country held under a particular lease or pastoral license. [sic] (PAUL, p. 92)  (2) Group of rs. held by one owner, or in one station. The  whole area is spoken of as a r. (C.RH., p. 90) (3) Leasehold as opposed to freehold. (Sheep returns, 1878)  (4) Open as opposed to fenced country. `Out on the r.'; i.e., not in any of the paddocks. ([1874 Lady Barker Station Life], p. 62)  (5) Adjective. R. sheep, r. cattle, as opposed to paddock sheep or milking cows and hand-reared calves. (C.)  (6) As equivalent to station: e.g. `He has sold his r.';  `One of the best rs. in Canterbury.' In this sense r. did  not always include the sheep, as the word s[tation].  does. This usage is now uncommon and r. in these contexts would probably mean small grazing r. ([1874 Kennaway Crusts], p. 86;Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p. 152)  (7) A block of country, a division of a r. E.g. ewe r.  upper r. This sense was always rare, but is still in use  on some ss. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (8) To keep or carry. `He runs merinos'; `the station runs 10,000 sheep' ([1898 Morris Austral-English]; C)

Quote:  Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze.  It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826]

Quote:  First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole `station' so formed might also be termed a  run. In the third sense a  run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of  station but without including the sheep, i.e. `He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would.

Quote:  run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a `run'. The day is divided into four of these. 7.30am-9.30am, smoke-o; 10.00am-12 noon, dinner; 1.00pm-3.00pm smoke-o; 3.30pm-5.30pm, tea.  [2] Also another name for a sheep station.  [3] Also the contract circuit. A shearing contractor will arrange a `run' of sheds for his gang each season.
