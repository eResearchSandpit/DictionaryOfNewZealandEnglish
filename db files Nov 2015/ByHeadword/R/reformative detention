Quote:  At  the  other end  of  the  scale  is  the indeterminate   sentence   of   preventive detention.  A sentence of the same name existed  in  Britain  from  1908 to  1967. Introduced in New Zealand in 1954 to replace the sentence of reformative detention (1910) and declaration as an habitual offender and habitual criminal (1906), it remains very much alive here.
