Quote:  The roughing-out work was done with either a bulldozer or treedozer. The treedozer had the advantage of leaving a windrow on either side of the blade as it passes through the ground surface in the roughing out operation. When the treedozer was used for roughing out, windrows were left throughout the paddock containing stumps, bush, debris and some soil.
