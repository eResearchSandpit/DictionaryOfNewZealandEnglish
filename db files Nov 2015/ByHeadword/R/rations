Quote:  On December 24, 1866, the diarist remarks: `Sent rations to Stotburn hut.' I understand `rations' was the common term, although I did not see its use elsewhere in the diary, the word stores being used quite a few times. On May 20, 1867, we note that `J. Gavin drove to Drysdale's with provisions' - the solitary use of this word.

Quote:  Rations.-. Pronounced to rhyme with `nations', not with `passions' as in the army. The r. system went out of general use in Canterbury in the 'seventies. The old scale was 16lb meat, 10lb flour, 2lb sugar, l/4 lb tea a man a week; or sometimes 12lb meat, 12lb flour, 2lb sugar, and

1/4 lb tea. (C.)

Another pioneer, in referring to the food the men got on the stations, said it was called by the ship term `rations' (which he pronounced `rashuns')
