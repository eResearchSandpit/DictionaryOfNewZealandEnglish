Quote:  Near the mouth of the Middle Fiord [of Te Anau], they picked up a stone tomahawk and shot a `native emu'. The bird is described as being `curious among the feathered tribe, having neither wings nor tail'. Caples goes on to say that `Other night-loving birds, such as the keewee and green-bird promenaded around our camp all night.' ... [104] However I favour the conclusion that their `native emu' was the large type of kiwi (roa).
