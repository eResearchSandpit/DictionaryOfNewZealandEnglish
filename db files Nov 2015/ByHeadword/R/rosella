Quote:  A sheep that has cast most of his wool before shearing,  so is very easy to shear. R. is a shearers' word, probably brought from Australia. [1898 Morris Austral-English] gives two meanings for the word but not this one: (1) a sort of parrot; (2) a European who works bare to the waist (North Australian slang). Our word is probably derived from (2). ([1898 Morris Austral-English])
