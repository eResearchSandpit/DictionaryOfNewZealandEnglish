Quote:  Fishermen often use the term `run crayfish' for light-coloured crayfish, with yellow being a more prominent colour than usual. These run crays are either males or juvenile females, and they are usually potted on the outer edges of the rough bottom where it merges into sand, or on light rough bottom where the rock outcrops are small.
