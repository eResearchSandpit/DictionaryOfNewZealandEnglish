Quote:  The Purple Death has scored a few hits over the festive season.  It's a wine with a difference, recommended as `rough-as-guts' drinking. ... Word of the Purple Death has been spread by mouth but has even reached as far south as the Antarctic. ... At around $10 a bottle, few liquor outlets sell it as well as the Sapich brothers out Henderson way, in West Auckland.
