Quote:  Like other experienced topdressing pilots he selected this ridge because it lay parallel to the sowing direction and he kept as close as possible to it thereby taking advantage of the added lift provided by the air rising off the ridge face. This procedure, known as "ridge riding", meant the aircraft was flown about five metres above the crest of the ridge and slightly to one side of it.
