Quote:  Under the original terms, land purchasers were entitled upon payment  of an annual license fee of 10s. 6d. to depasture or run sheep and cattle upon such waste lands within the block as remained unappropriated. ... though Captain Cargill was then gazetted Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Otago block only, he received no definite instructions upon the subject of granting the runs. [139] The result was that he merely filed the applications for depasturage licenses as they were presented to him, whilst the applicants were left to pursue their further course as seemed best to them.
