Quote:  A new vegetable said to be ideal for stir-frys, curries and salads is ready for planting and could be in the shops in time for Christmas dinner. It is a small onion, described by Crop and Food Research scientists who developed it as a cross between shallots and chives. Its taste is mild, somewhere between garlic and onion, and it is crisp in texture. Known in Japan as rakkyo and used in a popular pickle called tsukemono,it was brought to New Zealand in 1997 to be tested as a commercial vegetable.
