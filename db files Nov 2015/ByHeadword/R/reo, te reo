Quote:  Reo - while the word is often translated as 'the language', this explanation hides the fact that the Maori language is revered as a living record of its people, and enshrines the ethos of the people. No one can fully know `te reo' unless one is acquainted with the proverbs, legends, histories and knowledge of all tribal groups and areas. Yet it is a lifetime work knowing 'te reo' of one's own tribal area.
