Quote:  Papaka, the crab: the largest is about two and a half inches across the carapace; a small crab, called the rerepari, abounds in the salt marshes. There is also a small crab found in the mussel, which has a very round red body and short legs. I have met with a little fresh-water crab, seventy miles inland; it is not above half an inch across the shell, delicately formed, of a dusky green color. There is no lobster in New Zealand.
