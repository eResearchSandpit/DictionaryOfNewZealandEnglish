Quote:  The erect erito [e-acute], and other umbelliferous palm-[68]trees wave their broad leaves proudly amid the varied foliage of the surrounding trees. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/105 There is scarcely a more splendid sight to behold than a New Zealand forest. In the one we now entered, we did not perceive any kouri, or yellow pine-trees; but the totara [a's-acute], or red pine, grew in vast abundance. ... The rito, and innumerable other palm-trees, were in great quantity.  <i>Ibid.</i>

1/143  In addition to the fare set before me at supper, a quantity of  rito, or hearts of the palm-tree, were also included. This vegetable, which is eaten uncooked, makes a salad unequalled for its excellent flavour, and is held in much esteem by the people.  <i>Ibid.</i>

1/287 rito The heart of the delicious palms, called E' Rito, is highly esteemed. The  korou, which the branches of another of these umbelliferous trees afford is equally prized, together with the saccharine roots of the ti, cabbage-tree.
