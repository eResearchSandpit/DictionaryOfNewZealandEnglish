Quote:  For winebox buffs, the tax inquiry has been rich in jargon; we have heard about "Raro Routes" (for Cook Islands money-go-rounds) and "poison pills" (for payments triggered if the IRD or media get wind of deals) and learnt the new verb to "tax aggress", meaning to push the IRD to its limits of tolerance.

Quote:  The deals were routed through the Cook Islands... The so-called "Raro-routes" used available law on deductibility of interest from loans, and inter-company share investments that were tax exempt... IRD would not disclose.. how it got the necessary information, nor the audit methods it used against the companies and individuals using the Raro-route schemes... "The Raro-route schemes were separate from those in the winebox"...
