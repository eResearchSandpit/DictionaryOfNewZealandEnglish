Quote:  Some accept the meaning I use : to infuriate someone by teasing, to the amusement of those in the know. But for one who agrees, three or four insist <i>rark</i> refers to a justified telling-off. Ted Anderson writes to say he grew up in Nelson and his wife Anne in Thames, and the pair of them have always used <i>rark</i> to mean stirring one up when they deserve it... Donald Macintosh Campbell... ferreted out Fr P S Dineen's <i>Dictionary of the Irish Language</i> which gives <i>radharc mo shul do bhaite</i>, meaning essentially "to fool me" and shortened to <i>radharc</i>. Since the letters <i>dh</i> in the middle of <i>radharc</i> are silent, like the <i>gh</i> in night, the pronunciation was <i>rarc</i>. Either way, it's fun to be rarked up.
