Notes: Jim writes: In NZPOD but not in DNZE. NSOD and Collins tag it as <i>NAmer, Aust and NZ.</i> A very common feature of modern NZ houses, often mentioned in "for sale" ads. An integral part of NZE since circa 1970. The term did not occur in the English Property Supplement to a 1987 Midlands newspaper.
