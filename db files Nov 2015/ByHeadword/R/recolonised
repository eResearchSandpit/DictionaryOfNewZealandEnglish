Quote:  In fact, New Zealand remained a colony, albiet a privileged one, from the 1880s till the 1960s. Belich dubs this era, which followed four decades of colonisation, as New Zealand's "recolonised" period. It was a time of tightened economic and cultural links to Britain and a role for this country as Britains "town supply district".
