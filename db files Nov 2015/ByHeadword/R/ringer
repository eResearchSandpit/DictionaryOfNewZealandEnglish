Quote:  ringer: The fastest shearer in the shed over the period of shearing, and different from a `gun'. The ringer could be the best of several gun shearers in the same shed, but he could also be a ringer in a weak team and not even be a gun. A possible origin of the term can be found under `quoits' but others are that the ringer `runs rings round the rest' and the ringer in Yorkshire dialect means anyone superlatively good.

Quote:  `Ringer,' of course, persists for the fastest hand in a shed; with about an equal probability of derivation from the man, horse, or ship that runs `rings' round an antagonist, or from the ringer of the bell that has marked success in many games or contests besides that of the sportive `shooting gallery.'
