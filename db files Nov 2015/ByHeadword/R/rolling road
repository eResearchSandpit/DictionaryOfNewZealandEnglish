Quote:  As I went along this creek, I was struck by the great number of rolling roads crammed full of logs - piles of them heaped in the creek whereon the roads abutted; at least about two thousand logs are now awaiting a long desired fresh.

Quote:  Flotation is the method most commonly used in the kauri districts ... After the trunks are cut into lengths a `rolling-road' is formed to the nearest creek. All the scrub is closely cut down for a width of from twenty-five to thirty feet ... to obtain an approximately even surface, inclined towards the creek. The logs are forced along this road by timber-jacks, which the bushmen use with remarkable skill, and are impelled with a rapidity which is simply astonishing to persons unused to the process. If the creek contains plenty of water the logs float to the nearest booms without further trouble ...

Quote:  Hochstetter in 1889 and Kirk in 1874 [Report to Parliament], refer to rolling roads. Kirk describes them as `broad tracks, thirty to forty feet wide, in which every advantage is taken of the natural incline of the surface, and from which all trees have to be removed, the stumps cut level with the surface, inequalities roughly levelled, and large holes filled up. The logs are forced along these roads by `timberjacks' until they reach the water. In this way the logs are moved with great ease. ...[D.H.McMillan] Rolling roads were formed by laying three rickers or other small trees lengthwise to the line of road, and logs were placed crosswise on this road. There might be thirty or forty or more in a fleet. Three men with timber lacks usually operated this job.

Quote:  ... what was called the rolling road ... was anything up the 30 feet wide, with all the stumps cut down to ground level ... A lot of loose skids would probably be laid on the ground running in the direction the log would travel. The logs were then rolled along the road with jacks, usually two men to a log.
