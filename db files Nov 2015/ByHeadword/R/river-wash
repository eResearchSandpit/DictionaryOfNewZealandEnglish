Quote:  2.  River-bed Gravels and Sands. - These occupy the beds of the Clutha and Kawarau Rivers. ...Throughout the Dunstan and Kawarau Gorges these  Gravels, commonly spoken of as river-wash, rest on the schist bottom. ... The only practicable method of winning gold lying at the bottom of this river-wash is dredging.
