Quote:  Return-race sheds may use space inefficiently but they do have certain advantages. Shorn sheep go to the back of the shed by return races which are on the same level as the pens and board. The return races can also be used for footrotting, inocculating and drafting. Unwelcome draughts are avoided in an internal-race shed.
