Quote:  The Ring is the second-best institution in New Zealand Gaols, the best being the Dummy. The Ring is in the prison yard and about thirty feet in diameter. The game is to try and find the end of it; but you never do, although you are marched around it from eleven in the morning until five o'clock.
