Quote:  Deeper scarves were cut out of all Leaning trees to prevent them from splitting up. After sawing to a certain depth ..... each man alternately cut round his side of the tree almost to the front scarf. The adoption of this plan, known as `ringing', caused the wood to break clean when falling.
