Quote:  RIFFLE OR RIPPLE: both terms were used for the grooves cut across the bottom of a sluice-box or for the much more common wooden bars fixed at right angles, obliquely, or lengthwise, to the bottom of a sluice. The `riffleboard' was detachable and formed a `false bottom'. `Riffle' was probably a Californian term; `ripple' seems to have been more usual on the goldfields of Australasia.
