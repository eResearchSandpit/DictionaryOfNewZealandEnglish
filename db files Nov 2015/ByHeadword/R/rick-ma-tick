Quote:  Alison Nevill, of Dunedin, asks about the fascinating phrase "the whole rick-ma-tick". She says her Scottish grandmother employed a maid in the 40s who used it constantly, meaning something like "that's all there is to it". The maid came from Stirling, and the family always thought it was one of her home-town expressions, so when Alison got to New Zealand, she was surprised to hear it being used in the same context of finality. "The whole rick-ma-tick" has a long and honourable history as a Scottish version of "the whole kit and caboodle", an expression from the United States east coast that is widely understood here as an ornate alternative to "the whole lot".
