Notes: Jim Cameron writes: In the sense of a radiant electric heater, Collins records this as <i>Austral & NZ</i>. This was the ordinary NZ term for this object at least up to the 1960s. A notice published in the press in 3/00 mentions <i>electric radiator</i>. Not in DNZE or NZPOD Also often called <i>bar heater</i>.
