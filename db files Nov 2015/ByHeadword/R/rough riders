Quote:  It may not be amiss to explain how the name `Rough  Riders' came to be applied to the contingents. The Premier .... expressed a strong opinion that we should not accept the title of `Bushmen' which had been adopted in Australian. [because of possible confusion with the Bushmen of South Africa] .... As they were not regularly trained troops, and were to be good riders ready for rough work, he thought they should be called `Rough Riders', and expressed the hope that they would be particularly rough on the enemy. Accordingly the name was adopted, and under it the Third and Fourth Contingents have been raised.

Richard John Seddon. He was of the opinion that they should not be called `Bushmen' as the Australian men were called. He had been told that the Bushmen of Africa were held in contempt and he objected to New Zealand men starting with a name that would suggest anything but the respects he was quite sure they would be entitled to.
