Quote:  The sentiments of the verse are prudent and public - 14-'18 jingoism, boozy West Coast camaraderie ...; even the lusty heyday of the ragtowns with their brothels and casinos and boatloads of dancing-girls from Sydney is diluted into a nostalgic wink at the waywardness of the boys.
Notes:  (Pearson `Fretful Sleepers')
