Quote:  Apparently the runholder has only to petition for large blocks of the choicest agricultural land, and they are granted forthwith, but should the adjoining runholders follow the example of the holder 327 (and in common justice they have an equal right to the same privilage - viz., free-selection before survey), the land that will be left to be dealt with for settlement when the leases of the runs fall in will be of inferior quality.

Quote:  [In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding] Over here [in Canterbury the Australian `squatters'] were called runholders. ... [11] see SHEEPMEN... [11]

When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Quote:  First, let an impartial estimate of all the pasturage be made (as to the estimate contained in your leading article, I can only say "Credeat Judaeus Apella," or, - a Wairau runholder may believe it but I can't), however, I should imagine the <i>smaller</i> the pasturage, the more reason for its <i>equitable</i> and <i> economical</i> distribution.
