Quote:  The postie biked past twice a day ... The milko would rattle past with his cart of a morning ... cause we was getting milk through the Charitable Aid Board [c1930]. Then there was the rabbit-o, who sometimes talked Mum into buying a couple of his little skinned carcases.

Quote:  One suburban sound of the 1940s, now completely vanished from New Zealand streets, was that of food vendors: the rabbito and the whitebait seller and the clip-clopping hooves of the milko's horse-drawn float - as the milk waggon was called.
