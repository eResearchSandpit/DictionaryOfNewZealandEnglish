Quote:  Some insects, instead of risking the hazards of riding the wind, take the safer option of hitchhiking on aircraft. This seems to hasve been the case with a nest of red imported fire ants (RIFA) found at Auckland Airport in March, 2001... RIFA originate in the swampy Pantanal area of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.
