Quote:  Dubbed the Remuera Taxis, they are otherwise known as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), All Purpose Vehicles (APVs), Four-by-Fours (4 x 4), Recreational Vehicles (RVs) and four-wheel-drive (4WD) trucks. For many, they are now the family vehicle of choice, replacing the sedan and the stationwagon.
