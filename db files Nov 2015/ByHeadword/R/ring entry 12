Quote:  I suppose at that time [c1860s goldrush] I would be more interested in grabbing my `dumps' out of the ring at school, when some quick eye had noticed that a young pointer had tried to get away with placing a stinkie or a chalkie into play with the rest of his marbles. The `Grab your dumps'

was the roar, as we all rushed in for our own, and anybody else's one could get.
