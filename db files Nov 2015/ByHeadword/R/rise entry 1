Quote:  Rise: A timbered excavation constructed by working upwards, using upper holes. Rising was done on the three-compartment system, that is with a ladderway on one end and a return airway on the other, with a `box' in the centre. This box was kept filled with ore and used to stand on while drilling the roof, the level of the ore being maintained by, drawing off the surplus ore through a chute at the bottom of the box. Rises were about 9 ft by 4 ft in section and might reach from one level to the next (about 150 ft), or to a sublevel, or from a stope to the level above.
