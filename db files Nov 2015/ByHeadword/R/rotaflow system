Quote:  I had long heard of the herring-bone milking shed, but the rotaflow system.. was a new development... The Friesan cows walk into individual bails on the slowly revolving platform; the milking cups go on; each cow does a circuit; the cups are automatically removed; and then the cows receive a light spray of water which serves to nudge them out of the bail towards the yard.
