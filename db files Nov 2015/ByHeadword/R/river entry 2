Quote:  When I had returned to New Zealand and wrote The Adaptable Man set in Suffolk, a sharp-eyed critic noted my inaccurate reference to the  Orwell River instead of the correct, River Orwell, my

usage being the New Zealand [154] idiom - the Rakaia River, the Waitaki River, the Clutha River - and not the English - River Thames, Humber, Orwell.
