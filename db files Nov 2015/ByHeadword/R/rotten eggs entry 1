Quote:  Even more of a nuisance to New Zealand farmers are Californian poppies, Escholzia californica, better known in Centra Otago in my childhood as rotten eggs. This was probably for the intense orange of the flowers... In its home in California, great sweeps of egg-yolk gold against the blue leaves are breathtaking. Since the rotten egg has become a darling of the landscape designer, several colours have evolved, including pink, a near brown, and a beautiful soft clotted-cream that comes true from seed year after year.
