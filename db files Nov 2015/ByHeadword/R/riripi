Quote:  We got a `fiery stick' from some Maoris ... who were waiting for a

`Goashore' of `Ripiri' to cool ... The mess was in time cool enough, when they all surrounded the great pot, some with pewter spoons, ... but most with shells from the beach ... .

Quote:  Hadfield in his 1839 diary mentions eating a meal which included boiled flour. This is probably the same food which became known to the Maoris later as riripi. It consisted of flour and water, with sugar [53] to sweeten, boiled and served up as a kind of porridge. In the early whaling days it was often served up to a whole village community from a canoe set up like a trough from which the villagers scooped their requirements in large bowls or paua shells. Many of the Ngati Raukawa of Otaki have vivid recollections of having eaten riripi in their childhood.
