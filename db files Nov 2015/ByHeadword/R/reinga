Quote:  The whole body of New Zealanders firmly believe in the Reinga as the only one place for their departed spirits. As soon as the soul leaves the body it makes its way with all speed to the western coast; if the spirit of a person who resided in the interior, it takes with it a small bundle of the branches of the palm tree as a token of the place where it resided; if one who lived on the coast, the spirit takes with it a kind of grass which grows by the seaside, which it leaves at different places on the road to the Reinga.
