Quote:  The Maori rat, as I know it, is rather smaller than the common or Norwegian variety. It has a very long tail - at least one third longer than the ordinary; - its coat is as fine as velvet, and is of a bluish colour, showing at first sight a black shade, while the head is also a more pleasing type.

Quote:  We saw no four footed Animals either tame or wild or signs of any except Dogs and Ratts and these were very scarce especialy the latter. [f@n1] ... The so-called Native Rat or kiore, thought to be identical with <i>Rattus exulans</i> of Fiji is now almost extinct.

Quote:  The country is certainly destitute of all sorts of beasts either wild or tame except Dogs and Ratts, [sic] the former are tame and live with the people who breed and bring them up for no other purpose than to eat and ratts are so scare that not only I but many others in the ship never saw one.

Quote:  The Secretary read the following extracts from a letter of the Rev. W. Colenso to Ronald C. Gunn, Esq., of Launceston, dated Waitangi, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, 4th September, 1850:- `I have procured two specimens of the ancient, and all but quite extinct, New Zealand Rat, which until just now (and notwithstanding all my endeavours, backed, too, by large rewards) I never saw. It is without doubt a true Mus, smaller than our English black rat (Mus Rattus), and not unlike it. This little animal once inhabited the plains and Fagus forests of New Zealand in countless thousands, and was both the common food and great delicacy of the natives - and already it is all but quite classed among the things which were.'
