Quote:  Ring, v. (1) To cut the bark of a tree round the trunk so as to kill it. The word is common in the same sense in English forestry and horticulture, and only seems Australasian from its more frequent use, owing to the widespead practice of clearing the primeval forests and generally destroying trees. `Ringed' is the correct past participle, but `rung' is now commonly used. [1846] ... (2) to make cattle move in a circle. [1874] ... (3) To move round in a circle [1884] ...  (4) To make the top score at a shearing-shed.' See Ringer.
