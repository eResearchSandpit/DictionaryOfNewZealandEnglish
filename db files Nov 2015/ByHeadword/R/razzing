Quote:  In the meantime most of the rest of his team of dogs would be sent in to give the offending wild beasts a good razzing. Arnold would sneak in as close as possible to where the hullabaloo was going on and plant himself behind a tree or bank. Directly he thought the cattle had been given a sufficient razzing, he would give a low whistle.
