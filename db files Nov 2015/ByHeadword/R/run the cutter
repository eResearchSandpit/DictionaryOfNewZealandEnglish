Quote:  `He runs the cutter between a brothel in Frederick-Street and a nearby hotel', remarked Tec. Cassells of a crook in the S.M.'s court during the week. `Running the cutter' is a variant of the Sydney expression `running the rabbit' and the Yankee ones of `rushing the growler' or `the can' Which all mean the same thing i.e. fetching beer in a vessel.

Quote:  The expression `running the cutter' has its origins in the whaling days. ... `Grog shops' sprang up wherever ships called regularly ... When a ship lay at anchor, most of the crew would go ashore and an `anchor watch' would be left aboard. Very often, some thirsty soul ... would `borrow' the cutter and slip ashore for rum ... This was `running the cutter'. Later, in days when some areas were under prohibition, the term was used for the job of going to the nearest licensed hotel for liquor. ... And the driver comes in and breasts up to the bar./ He says, `Give me a jar and a couple of crates,/ For I am running the cutter tonight for me mates!'/... `We are fresh out of beer,/So that's why I'm here,/ Running the cutter tonight./
