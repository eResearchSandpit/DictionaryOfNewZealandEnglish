Quote:  Rengarenga, Rock Lily... The plant is sometimes known as renga lily or Mabel Island lily (after an island of this name near Picton, where the plant is particularly striking). An alternative Maori name for the plant, maikika, is shared with two native orchids that have similar, starchy, edible root-like tubers.
