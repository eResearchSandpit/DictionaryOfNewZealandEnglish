Quote:  <i> Red rock lobster Jasus edwardsii </i>... Closely  related to <i> J. novaehollandiae </i> of southern Australia and <i> J. lalandii </i> of South Africa ... `Crayfish' has been regularly used as a common name, although it is more properly applied to freshwater species. Some combination of `red', `spiny', and `rock lobster' is more appropriate.
