Quote:  Belich divides the period covered by the volume, the 1880s to the present, into three broad phases: the progressive colonisation which was the dominant feature of <i>Making Peoples</i>; the rise of recolonisation, which tightened the relations between Britain and colonies up to the 1960s and made them co-owners of imperial culture and heritage; and finally decolonisation, the period since the 1960s in which New Zealand has achieved economic diversification, greater independence in foreign policy and a great socio-demographic "coming-out" of difference.

Quote:  By recolonisation he means the powerful tightening of economic, social and cultural ties to Britain that began in the 1880s and lasted till the 1970s.  It turned New Zealand into "a town-supply district of London" while "London became the cultural capital of New Zealand."
