Quote:  If they've taken off too much wool with the necks, they are just as good as the fleece, but we have to give the 'ropes' a bit of special treatment. At the scour, someone had gone through the result of this sort of skirting a second time, separating the fleece from the 'ropes' which to anyone who has handled wool is a very descriptive term.
