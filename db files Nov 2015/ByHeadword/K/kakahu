Quote:  The caller expected the kakahu [cloaks] to be worth about $2000 each. The visitors were out of luck. A kakahu can't be completed in a month... "it takes nearly 12 months out of a woman's life." <i>ibid.</i> 14 Traditional kakahu are made by taking the fibre out of the harakeke [flax leaf] and washing, pounding and drying it in a process that takes months. The weaving in of the feathers then begins.

[1963 fn] The word `mat' is a marginal interpolation; below Markham gives the more accurate rendering, `cloak'. <i>ibid.</i> 40 Cacahows are now getting very scarce and a Ki tuck-er [<i>kaitaka</i>] or Mat Cacahow, [with] ornamented borders, is rarely to be seen in the present day.

This flax is also made use of for laying up ropes, lines, &c. The superior dress called Kaitaka[a2-a3-acute], is made from silken flax, (<i>hunga hunga</i>[as-acute].)
