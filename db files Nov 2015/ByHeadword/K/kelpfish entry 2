Quote:  <i>Butterfish</i> A small family (Odacidae) of Australasian shallow- water, weed dwelling and eating fishes, sometimes called kelpfishes or weed whitings. internationally the name butterfish is used for the family to which our warehou belong, but in New Zealand the name is so firmly associated with the species described below that a change is unlikely. <i>ibid.</i> 111 The name kelpfish is loosely used. in New Zealand it is used for one of the species described below [Chironemus marmoratus] and describes the other [Aplodactylus arctidens, Marblefish] in terms of its habitat. it is also used for some greenish wrasses.
