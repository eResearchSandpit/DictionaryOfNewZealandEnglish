Quote:  On August 12 i went to the swamp to look for larks (<i>katata</i>), and also found the kauri grub (<i>Helix busby</i>), only to be seen in the kauri area. <i>ibid.</i> 70 i remained in this forest till the 20th, finding many kauri grubs; while under the rata roots i also found the Aweta, or plant-caterpillar, which to change into a chrysalis creeps underground, and in many cases instead of becoming a moth becomes - a mushroom!
