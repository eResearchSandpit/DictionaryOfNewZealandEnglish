Quote:  One good example of a variation of this game [of Blindman's Buff] is Kikeri (Ratipiko). `Kikeri is a sort of mixture betwen Blindman's Buff and Tag only instead of your eyes being bandaged you all play in the dark. One of the players stays outside in a lighted room while the others go into a dark room. When all are hidden, they call out `Kikeri Kikeri' and the catcher comes in. The others try to get passes [sic] into the other room and if they do they call out `Kikeri'. Whoever is caught has to go the next catcher.'
