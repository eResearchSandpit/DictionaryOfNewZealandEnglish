Quote:  it is called kamokamo, sometimes spelled kumukumu, less often kumakuma, cooma-cooma or kumi-kumi, and very often sloppily pronounced `cum-cum' for short.... By 1936 (at the very latest) the kamokamo was recognised as a commercial variety of squash, since it was listed as such in a book `Vegetable Growing in New Zealand' published that year.
