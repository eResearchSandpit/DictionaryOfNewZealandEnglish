Quote:  (W.J. Elvy `Maori History') Much has been writted concerning the so-called pit [387] dwellers, who formerly inhabited the district. When Europeans commenced to settle in the Sounds the bush had practically established itself to the water's edge. The few vestiges of aboriginal cultivation were rapidly becoming clothed with a dense second growth and, except for a few localities occupied by the remnants of native tribes, had been practically obliterated. As the colonists commenced to clear the bush, despite the fact that on their land were large forest trees that had apparently taken centuries to grow, vestiges of an ancient occupation were brought to light in the shapes square or oblong pits. These pits were of varying shapes and sizes, many bunched into steep spurs and forming a series that reached from the shores to the tops of the low hills, and all placed in secure positions on land not liable to slip. These numerous pits were widely scattered throughout the Sounds and, some being similar to those in use in the North as store pits, they were called by the settlers' `Kumera pits' under the impression that they had been used to store those tubers for food supply. investigation proved this idea to be erroneous; the pits were found in positions unsuitable for such storage and the presence of shell heaps amongst them proved that they had formed part of the dwellings of an ancient people.
