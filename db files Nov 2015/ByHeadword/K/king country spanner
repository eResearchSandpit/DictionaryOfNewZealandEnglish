Quote:  There are those who nostalgically look back on the days of no-licence and sly grog and wonder where the move to have the King Country union discard the traditional `King Country spanner' as its emblem originated. For the uninitiated, the King Country spanner was more than just a bottle-opener - it was a symbol of stout-hearted refusal to submit meekly to a `dry' regime that King Country thought was unjustly imposed on it. You could always get `it' if you knew how.
