Quote:  When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. it is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.
