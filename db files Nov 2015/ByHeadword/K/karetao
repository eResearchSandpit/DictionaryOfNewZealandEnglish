Quote:  But the carvings are not poupou (columns).  They are puppets, or karetao, representing the MPs holding each of the seven Maori seats in the last parliament. ... Some of the karetao carry two sets of strings, metal linking them back to their parties and wider democratic system, and flax signifying the link back to their Maori constituents.
