Quote:  in Tom's early years at Puketiti, anything up to forty axemen were employed. They usually worked in gangs of four, and a gang would sometimes scarf for a full week before they let the `King' tree go. The procedure was to work `drives'. Depending on various factors, a certain defined area would be `scarfed', i.e. each tree in that area would have a scarf cut in it to the point where it was about to fall, and when the whole of that particular area was completed the `King' tree would be felled. This tree, specially selected for the purpose, would be so situated that, as it fell, it would take two or three of the scarfed trees with it. They in turn would do the same, and so on, and the whole area would fall almost as one. This is known as working a drive, and saves a tremendous amount of axe work.
