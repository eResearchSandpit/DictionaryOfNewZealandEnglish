Quote:  That the Kaikoura Orogeny culminated during a short interval of time at the end of the middle Pleistocene (Table 12.1) and is now waning would be cheering if it could be proved, but no proof is given and it is equally likely that the culmination is yet to come, and that we have to expect as many earthquakes and uplifts in the next ten thousand years as we had in the last ten thousand.
