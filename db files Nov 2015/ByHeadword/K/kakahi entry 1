Quote:  The native freshwater mussels known to Maori as kakahi and to science as <i>Hyridella menziesii</i> (and several related species), are oval shellfish typically between 50 and 90 mm in length. They resemble a pipi in shape,though they possess a black horny covering - the periostracum - like a marine mussel. Kakahi once formed extensive beds in New Zealand lakes and rivers, living shallowly buried in sand or mud, like pipi, rather than attached to rocks in the manner of most marine mussels.
