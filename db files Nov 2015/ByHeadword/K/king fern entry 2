Quote:  The true KiNG FERN (<i>Todea barbara </i>) occurs only in the far north ... though it also native to Australia and South Africa... The PARA or HORSESHOE FERN (<i>Marattia salicina</i>) is often spoken of as the king fern, but this name belongs  more appropriately to <i>Todea barbara </i>, a close relative  of the British royal fern (<i>Osmunda</i>) ...
