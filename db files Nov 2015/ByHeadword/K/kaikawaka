Quote:  The tree <i>  [Libocedrus Bidwillii]</i>  is often known to bushmen as the <i> Kaikawaka,</i>  [68] though Colenso states that its correct name is Pahautea. ... it and the previous species [<i> L. plumosa, Kawaka </i> ] are sometimes also called the New Zealand <i> Cedar </i> , but must not be confused with <i> Dysoxylum spectabile </i> , to which this name is often applied.
