Quote:  The lizard fauna of South Marlborough is diverse. Five species of the <i>Hoplodactylus maculatus</i> complex are known from the general area. Common gecko and Canterbury gecko are found in shrubland and forest, and Southern Alps gecko, Marlborough mini gecko and the threatened Kaikouras gecko (data deficient) are found in open rocky areas. The threatened black-eyed gecko (sparse) and rough gecko (gradual decline) have also been recorded.

Quote:  The presence of the threatened (range restricted) Kaikouras gecko is particularly notable. it is an uncommon species of the "common gecko" complex and is known previously from only two sites: Patutu (peak) and inland of Ward (Whitaker and Gaze, 1999).
