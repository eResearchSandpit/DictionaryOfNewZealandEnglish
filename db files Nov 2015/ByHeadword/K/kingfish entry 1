Quote:  King-fish, n. in New Zealand a sea-fish, <i>Seriola lalandii</i> Maori, <i>Haku</i>), sometimes called the <i>Yellow Tail</i>; in Victoria, <i>Sciaena antarctica,</i> Castln. Called <i>Jew-fish</i> (q.v.) in New South Wales. Tenison Woods says the King-fish of Port Jackson must not be confounded with the King-fish of Victoria or the King-fish of Tasmania (<i>Thyrsites micropus</i>, McCoy). The Port Jackson king-fish belongs to a genus called `Yellow-tails' in Europe. This is <i>Seriola lalandii</i>, Cuv. and Val. <i>Seriola</i> belongs to the family <i>Carangidae</i>, or Horse-Mackerels.<i>Thyrsites</i> belongs to the family <i>Trichiuridae</i>. The `Barracouta' of Australasia is another species of <i>Thyrsites,</i> and the `Frost-fish' belongs to the same family. The <i>King-fish</i> of America is a different fish; the name is also applied to other fishes in Europe.
