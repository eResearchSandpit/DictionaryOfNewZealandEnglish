Quote:  in the house, big fire of dead tete-a-weka wood going. Two witch's pots (small edition of a whaler's try-pot) and a camp oven swinging above the fire. Titis sizzling in their own kato fat (fat from insides). Piro fat, the fine fat from the intestines, is more precious.
Notes:  1952 Apr 20 in 1982 Sansom in the Grip of an island 154
