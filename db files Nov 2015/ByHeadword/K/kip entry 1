Quote:  But the most interesting of all the team games was a small group game variously known as <i>Cunning Joe</i> (K-6), Cunny, Conjure, Conjo, Cunny Joe, and Cronje. in this game the cat [a thin 6-inch stick with pointed ends] was sometimes called the Cunning Joe stick (Waikouaiti, Otago, 1900) or the kip (Dunedin, 1895). it was a game for four players.

Two rings were marked on the ground a short distance from each other with a square drawn in the middle of each. A boy armed with a short stick stood at each ring, a bowler behind him. One of the bowlers tossed a short piece of wood at the ring opposite. The striker hit it as hard as he could, then both boys ran as in cricket.
