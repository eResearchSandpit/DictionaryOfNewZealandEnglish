Quote:  FOREST BiVOUAC. ... Strengthened by the usual New Zealand food of roasted potatoes and `damper', we set off ... but soon found ourselves bewildered ... in the surveyor's lines which crossed one another in all directions in the wood. We then resorted to the usual expedient of torches made of `karehao' (supple Jack) or `katoa'; ... it was [agreed] ... that we should light a fire and bivouac for the night.
