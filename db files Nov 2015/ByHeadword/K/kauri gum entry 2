Quote:  Kauri gum is the solidified resinous sap of the kauri tree, found only in northern New Zealand. Such 'bush' gum [that collected in cavities in high branches] was usually clean  .. Another type of gum was 'hill' gum, found on low-lying hills and flats. The gum most prevalent in the far North was 'swamp gum' which was located by the 'hook' method.
