Quote:  Of those trees which were generally to be met with, the pine was by far the most beautiful, and in height exceeded all the others beyond any degree of comparison. We observed two species of it, but the mountain-pine, called by the natives <i>cowrie</i>, which we found growing upon the sides and summits of the hills, and rising to an enormous size, was the most remarkable. <i>ibid.</i>  1/233. Mountain pine, called by natives cowrie <i>ibid.</i> 1/304-305 ... we looked about in search of resin, which is brought down by the streams from various parts of the interior. ... [305] ... The pine, called by the natives <i>cowree</i> abounds with resin; and i believe it is the only tree of that species in the island that has any. <i>ibid.</i> 2/244 Pines of different descriptions, and which are utterly unknown to Europeans, are here to be met with ...; and those species which bear the uncouth names of the cowrie, the totarra, the towha, and the zarida, afford such a supply of valuable timber as the profusion of some ages to come will not be able to exhaust.
