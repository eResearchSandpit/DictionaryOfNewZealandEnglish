Only five species...are known, one of which (<i>Nestor productus</i>) has lately become extinct; they only occur in New Zealand and Norfolk island. They were formerly classed among the <i>Trichoglossina</i> or brush-tongued parrots ... more nearly allied to true <i>Psittaci</i> ... its ordinary food consists of berries and insects; but since its Alpine haunts have been reached by the tide of civilization, it has acquired a taste for raw flesh, to obtain which it even attacks living animals.'

Quote:  <i>Kea</i>.- As often as not shepherds pronounce this word `keaw'. i am told by the greatest living authority on native birds that no recognised naturalist any longer denies that keas kill sheep. My own experience of them is that only a small percentage (perhaps 5 or 10 per cent.) are actual killers, but they are all potential killers, as they will all eat meat.

Quote:   `Kea in O.E.D. ... [should be spelt] <i>kia,</i> a bird (Nestor notabilis), mountain-parrot: Williams in <i>Maori Dictionary</i>, says probably so named from its screech. it is so; but the usual spelling, kea, is not the sound of the screech, which is kia. i have often heard it in the mountains; a long-drawn kiaaaaa or vibrato lia-a-a-a: close at hand the cry is tender as the mewing of a kitten. The error has come through words like fear, tear, hear, but the Maori spelling of those words would be fia, tia, hia, ignoring the "r" as a non-Scot would.
