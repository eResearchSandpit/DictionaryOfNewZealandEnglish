Quote:  Along the path from the lean-to, the 'dunny' beside the cypress tree and soon known as 'the cypress', was covered with the small fragrant roses known to us as 'dunny roses', and was without a door, while the dunny seat, long and wide like a beach dunny, was set over a deep hole half-filled with old 'kiki' (our word for faeces) in varying shades of brown, topped with faded pieces of newspaper, the <i>Oamaru Mail</i> and the <i>Otago Daily Times</i>.
