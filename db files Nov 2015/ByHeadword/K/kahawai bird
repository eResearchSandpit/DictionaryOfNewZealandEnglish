Quote:  WHiTE FRONTED TERN (<i>Sterna striata</i>), Tara of the Maoris, is abundant all around the New Zealand coasts and occurs in Tasmania and Eastern Australia as well. This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

Quote:   <i>Sterna ... frontalis [? striata] </i>... it pursues schools of small fish close to the coasts of New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, and as the kahawai fish also feed on the same class of food, the tern is a useful indicator to fishermen of their presence. Hence its name of kahawai bird. Kahawai Bird. Sea Swallow, Tom Noddy. TARA.

Quote:  They derive one of their popular names from the forked tail, pointed wings and agile flight which make them so like the welcome swallows of the land; but these white-fronted terns are better known by another title here. They are the kahawai birds, of the wheeling, diving flocks, which off-shore tell the trolling fisherman where to trail his line.
