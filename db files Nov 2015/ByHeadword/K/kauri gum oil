Quote:  An associated thing for <i>swamp gum</i> and <i>swamp kauri</i> is an `oil', which i refer to as `kauri gum oil' and which i must have seen talked about in print ... This is the oil which figures on northern maps extraordinarily, for instance, the L&S (1943) Provisional sheet N27 at map ref 601521, `Old Oil Well'. ... This oil was (can i say?) a seep of sap (pre-solid kauri gum?) from buried kauri; as far as i know it was used in mixing paint.
