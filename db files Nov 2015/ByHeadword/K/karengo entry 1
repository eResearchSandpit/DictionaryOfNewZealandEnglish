Quote:  What many Pakehas may not realise, however, is that we have a close relation of nori growing along our coastline, commonly known by its Maori name, karengo .. The most commonly used species for Japanese nori is Porphyra tenera, whereas our karengo is Porphyra columbina .. But to be honest, i've tried karengo fresh, dried, cooked with orange juice, diluted with kumara, disguised with parmesan - and, still, i couldn't honestly say i adore its flavour, which, to me, has rather too strong an iodine edge to be delicious.

Quote:  This is the genus Porphyra, varieties of which are found all over the world. in Wales it is known as laver (P. laciniata) in Japan as nori (P. tenera) while here in New Zealand we call it karengo (P. columbina.). Karengo looks like greenish purple sheets of cellophane with frilly edges, and is to be found clinging to rocks at low tide. in shape, it resembles green sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) which is also edible.
