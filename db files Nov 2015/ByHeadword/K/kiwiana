Quote:  Particularly striking are... David Geary's dynamic and irresistibly incisive piece of Kiwiana, bubbling with one-liners ("like Becket, as she got older she got more succinct"); Lloyd Jones's informative and entertaining reflection on Wellington in the 70s ("... a precious number of BYOs were starting up. These eateries were Wellington's equivalent of the samizdat press inn the Eastern bloc, promoted by word of mouth and subject to police raids.") 									= From Sport 21

Quote:  To [ian Wedde\} kiwiana is "a term that's been invented by us to be able to describe a range of cultural items that help to define some kind of sense of national identity"... But he says kiwiana doesn't encompass the "complexity and the kind of gnarliness" of our culture. it's not popular culture. it's minority culture, and a very small minority culture."... As for Wedde's own kiwiana possessions - any paua shell collections, punga vases? "i guess it would be my gas barbecue, or Skilsaw. They're associated with a very Kiwi way of life and have a quality that's, sort of, very familiar."

Quote:  it follows that the icons of Kiwiana, so many of them drawn from advertising's rose-coloured world, amount to a fairly one-sided view of New Zealand.
