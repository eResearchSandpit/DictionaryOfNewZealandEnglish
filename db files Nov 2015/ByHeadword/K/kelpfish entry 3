Quote:  BUTTER FiSH <i>(Coridodax pullus)</i>. ... [14] Known by many as the kelp-fish, and by the fishermen in some places as the butter-fish. Dr. Knox, in the <i>Transactions of the New Zealand institute</i>, gives the following interesting details of the marare of the Natives : `On the 2nd August, 1870, a large quantity of the kelp-fish were offered for sale in and about Wellington, and though by no means prepossessing in external appearance, being of a dingy-black colour, and covered with a slimy mucus, i found that the fish frequent Cook Strait, more especially off and around the Mana.' <i>ibid.</i> 56 KELP FiSH (see BUTTER FiSH).

Quote:  it is unfortunate that the Butterfish [<i>Coridodax pullus</i> ] has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish [?though] there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>ibid.</i> 169 Kelpi Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish

Quote:  Mainly a vegetarian the Butterfish will take small sea animals and shellfish on occasions. Kelp-fish and Kelpie are names sometimes used as are the Maori names `mairari' and `rari'. No relation to his Australia namesake.
