karaka
Homonym Number:  1
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:<i>karaka</i> is the chief modern name among New Zealanders; others are obsolesc. Among the more precise and knowedgeable people it is n1. pronounced [k'rak a] but the old anglicisations ['kraeka] [ka'raeka] are still very common, especially in country districts and in the bush. Early spgs (<i>cracker, kraka</i>) point to these pronunciations; even as accurate an observer as E. J. Wakefield would spell it `kraka' (perhaps [krak a]), although in his `Adventures in NZ' it is always written <i>karaka.</i> cf <i>cracker, caraceer;</i> a spreading tree common in coastal areas and producing orange fruit, the kernels of which are poisonous unless soaked and cooked [Maori]; cowtree, New Zealand laurel (kopi, Chatham island).
