Quote:  <i>ku[u]mara</i> is the spelling of the name of this tuber, and this has been

the spelling in the <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, for instance, from its first volume in 1892 to the present day. it has more than one been suggested that the tuber first came from Peru, and this is fully discussed in <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, vol. 54 (1945), 175, where the point is made that the northern Quichua-speaking people of Peru and Ecuador have the sweet potato and know it under the names kumar, komal, and kumal, which names have as counteraprts in Polynesia the terms kumara in Newzealand (Maori), Rarotonga, the Tuamotus, Mangareva, and Easter island; umara and umaa in Tahiti; kumala in Tonga, 'umala in Samoa; uala and uwala in Hawaii; with kumaa in the Marqueses; and ku'a'ra in Mangaia. Remembering the "l" and :r: interchange in some of the dialects, and remembering the dropping of letters as indicated by hamzah, it seems evident that the form kumara represents all these different forms: seeing, too, that in none of them is the median "a" replaced by "e," there seems to be no doubt that the correct spelling is kumara and not kumera. in Williams' <i>Dictionary</i>, ku[u]mara is the main entry: there is an entry kumera, but is no more than a reference; ku[u]mera = kumara.
