Quote:  in other words, when people looked across the marae atea to the gate where the two were waiting to be called in, someone standing behind the kaikaranga said in a not-too-quiet whisper, 'He's brought his laptop with him.' This caused the kaikaranga to choke on the first syllable of her call, which is very bad form indeed.
