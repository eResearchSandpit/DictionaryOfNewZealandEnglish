Quote:  Even if you have to close your eyes and hold your nose, you should definitely try kina... As a child, you and your friends smashed a kina against the rocks and didn't like what you found: an oily-looking mass of black and grey goo... Despite kina being prolific breeders and voracious, aggressive eaters (they compete for broken kelp with paua and end up eating the paua out of house and home), our national kina resource, however large, is fragile.
