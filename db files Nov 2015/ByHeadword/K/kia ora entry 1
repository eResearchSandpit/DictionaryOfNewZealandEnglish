Quote:  <i>Kia ora, interj.</i> Maori phrase used by English in the North island of New Zealand, and meaning `Health to you!'. A private letter (1896) say - `You will hear any day at a Melbourne bar the first man say <i>Keora ta-u</i>, while the other says <i>Keora tatu,</i> so replacing `Here's to you!'. These expressions are corruptions of the Maori, <i>Kai ora taua</i>,' `Health to us too!' and <i>Kia ora tatou</i>,' Health to all of us!'
Notes:  [Morris is in part wrong:<i> taua</i> is the dual pronoun `we two, us two' (not `us too"); <i>tatou</i> is the plural personal pronoun `you all, and myself; all of us (inclusive)!]

Quote:   `And they smiled sweetly and said, `Kia ora"'. Literally the phrase means `Be well', but to these pakehas it is one of the few phrases of Maori they know and they probably think it means `Good luck' or `Hullo'.

Quote:  Toasts were not in his line, but part of a verse from a Psalm, `We wish you good luck,' flashed into his mind, so he gave them `Kia Ora' (Good luck). This was said to be the first occasion the words were spoken in that sense, and they were received with acclamation - caught on - and have become a national phrase.
