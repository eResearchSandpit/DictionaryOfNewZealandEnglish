Quote:  KAEO AND SEA POTATOES/ subclass ASCiDiACEA ... the larva swims about free ... ; but later settles on the sea floor, or a convenient wharf pile, and exchange freedom for lumpish security ... The stalked [sea] squirt <i>Pyura</i> ... is common in the south. The Maori knows it as kaeo, and eats the inner part which has a good briny taste, slightly iodiny ... But a northern Maori ... said he did not eat kaeo. `Not Taranaki food - only southland Maori food.'
