Quote:  Karetu grass, or flax saturated witrh scented oils like raukawa, taramea gum, kopuru (fragrant moss) and tarata (lemonwood), were used as grass belts and head bands by Maori... A small piece of kopuru would fill a room with its smell and it was said that an important person would die soon after if only one person in a group could smell it.
