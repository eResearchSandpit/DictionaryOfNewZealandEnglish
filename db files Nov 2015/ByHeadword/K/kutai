Quote:  it wasn't always like this, though - why, when i think back to the times we rode many miles over the hills to gather kai moana to supplement our everyday diet. There were paua, kutai, and kaura, big and red, when they were in season. This entailed a whole day's journey, and more often than not we stayed half the night also, netting for fish at the narrows of the bay. We would return home with our pihau bags laden heavy with shellfish and fish. The fish, mostly mullet, were sorted, cleaned, gutted and then smoked. Fat plumpy kutai were shelled and bottled.
