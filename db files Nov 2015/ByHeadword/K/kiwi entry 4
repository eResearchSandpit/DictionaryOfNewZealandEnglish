Quote:  The kiwi (q.v.) as a national emblem is of comparatively recent date. it was used after 1911 in the badge of the 2nd South Canterbury (Territorial) Regiment and became widely known from the giant kiwi carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp, England, during the First World War. After 1940 the kiwi became synonymous with New Zealand servicemen overseas. The Kiwi Concert Party, which toured many battle areas during the Second World War, and the Kiwi (New Zealand Army) Football Team, which toured the British isles, France, and Germany in 1945-46, greatly enhanced the emblem's popularity. ... More recently, the kiwi has become the emblem used by New Zealand rugby league representative teams.

Quote:  One is so frequently exposed to the over-used, hackneyed word `Kiwi' that one is getting sick and tired of hearing it. ... From its legitimate Polynesian use for an endemic bird, it has now been stretched to include not only human beings, but lottery tickets, sportspeople, fruit, and now the dollar itself.
