kamahi
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:<i>Weinmannia</i> spp. often confused in popular terminology with beech (birch) species, esp. perhaps <i>towai</i> through similarity with <i>tawhai</i> (beech), hence popular misapplication of <i>kamahi</i> to <i>Nothofagus </i>spp.: some distinguish <i>towai</i> as <i>W. sylvicola</i> only; others apply <i>towai</i> to both spp. (so Williams) reserving <i>kamahi</i> (and <i>tawhero</i>) for W. racemosa only; a tall, spreading forest tree

Quote:  Kamai is called black birch in the Catlin River District and Southland, which name is given on account of a supposed resemblance to the `birches', or more correctly, `beeches', a number of which occur in that locality. i cannot understand how such an idea could have originated, for except in the ease of the bark of one there is not the slightest resemblance between the birches and kamai. Whatever be the reason, the misapplication of names is complete, for the birches are still commonly called kamai in Southland.

Quote:  <i>Tawhero & W. sylvicola; Kamahi W. racemosa</i>. Kamahi ... is particularly common in the forests of Westland where it is usually termed red birch (!), but most of the popular names there are misnomers. The foliage of the kamahi is much used particularly in Christchurch for decorative purposes, and sold under the name `red birch'.
