Quote:  Kaihua is a vigorous, soft-wooded vine that climbs by twining stems. ... Leaf variability is a characteristic of kaihua [sic], as its species name heterophylla suggests. ... Kaihua likes a shaded root run in a free draining soil, with the leaves up in the sun .. Kaihua can be seen growing through the plant collections at Otari and also throughout the bush, though you are more likely to smell it than see it.
