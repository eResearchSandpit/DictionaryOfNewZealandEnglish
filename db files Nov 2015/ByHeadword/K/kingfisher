Quote:  And then at the first beam of sun the birds began. Big cheeky birds, starlings and mynahs, whistled on the lawns, the little birds, the goldfinches and linnets and fantails flicked from bough to bough. A lovely kingfisher perched on the paddock fence preening his rich beauty, and a <i>tui</i> sang his three notes and laughed and sang them again.

Quote:  There is much confusion in the common names applied to New Zealand fishes, and the application of the name `Hake' to several distinct species of our fishes, is a good example of that confusion. in Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae</i>. The other name, `Southern Kingfish', is more appropriate, although it suggests affinities with another family of fishes, which are associated in New Zealand with the name of `Kingfish', namely the Carangidae or Trevally (occasionally spelt Trevalli) family, which includes the `Yellowtail' or `Kingfish' (<i>Regificola grandis</i>).
