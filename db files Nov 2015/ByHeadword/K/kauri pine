Quote:  The pine occurs only in the North island and north of Mercury Bay, and grows best near the sea on wet clay land. <i> ibid.</i> 143. The Native name `Kauri' is the only common name in general use. When the timber was first introduced into Britain it was termed `cowrie' or `kowdie-pine'; but the name speedily fell into disuse, although it still appears as the common name in some horticultural works. *`Cowrie-pine and Kowdie-pine were the names by which the kauri was first introduced to Britain.' --KEF, p.143.
