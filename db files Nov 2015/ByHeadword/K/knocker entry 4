Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  The shearers buy their shears from the station and then proceed to cut them and bend them, and embellish them with drivers,' `knockers,' "jockeys' and `cockspurs' until their makers would hardly recognise them. <i>ibid.</i> 28 The knockers on the shears silence the sound of steel on steel and all you hear is a faint tap-tap as the shears close, and sound of shuffling feet as the men shift their position.
