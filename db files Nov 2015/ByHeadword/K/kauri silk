Quote:  ``Kauri Silk', generally in the form of plaited strands representing the long tresses of blonde hair often seen on young girls of the period, appeared during this time. ...

`When a plait was made, often up to five feet long in finished form, it was tied with a ribbon and bow, top and bottom, and coiled in a suitable box, and offered for sale, or entered in any suitable exhibition competitions. ... To produce a nice specimen it is essential to have a good piece of gum. it would require to weigh about two pounds, [26] so that it could be firmly gripped, and should be pale and clear, and free from ruptures and defects. This seems to be difficult to acquire in these days. The lump must be scraped and cleaned and dried. ...

`With an old metal frypan or an old metal plate on the hot range, moved about to get just the right temperature, the lump of gum was pressed on to the plate until the surface melted, and was then slowly drawn out to arm's length or further, and as this was done, the melted surface miraculously came away in these beautiful drawn fibres, which were placed on the nearby table. The operation was completed [sic: ? repeated] until the required three bundles of strands were produced. These were plaited with a standard three-plait. The conditions of the old-time warm and humid kitchen were very necessary for the success of this process, as the gum fibres when cold are very fragile.
