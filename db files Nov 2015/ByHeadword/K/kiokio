Quote:  Kiokio (<i>Blechnum novae-zealandiae</i>) is probably one of the commonest ferns in New Zealand, and because of its habit of growing abundantly on roadside cuttings, it should be familiar even to those who never step out of their cars for a closer look.<i>ibid.</i> 77 More palatable are the young fiddleheads of many species, especially the hen and chickens fern, kiokio (<i>Blechnum novae-zealandiae</i>), gully fern (<i>Pneumatopteris pennigera</i>, shining spleenwort (<i>Asplenium oblongifolium</i>) and the shield ferns (<i>Polystichum richardii</i> and <i>P/vestitum</i>).
