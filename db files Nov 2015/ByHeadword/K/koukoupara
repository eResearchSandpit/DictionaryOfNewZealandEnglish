Quote:  Koukoupara - is a fish like the kokopu, but differently marked, and following the example of one of his informants, the translator [sc Beattie] has translated this as `mountain trout'. Koukoupara is the spelling adopted in the lists, but the [Maori] compilers have varied this with kopara, koupara, and kokaupara. Never once do they use the southern form of kokopara, which the southerners pronounced kokobala, which the early settlers soon turned into `cockabully'.
