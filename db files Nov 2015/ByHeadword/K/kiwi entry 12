Domain: [none]
Region: [none]
See: cf. Digger, Anzac
Pronunciation:
Notes:WW2 usage is rare in this sense and seems applied as a descriptive term by outsiders rather than used by NZ troops themselves: early in WW2 used as distinct from Digger (rather appropriated by Australians) and WW1 Anzac. Possibly first applied by non-New Zealand units, and adopted as appropriate, as a noun, as an attributive and (occas.) as a term of address. Often humorously pronounced [kaiwai], perhaps in imitative guying of American pronunciations.
