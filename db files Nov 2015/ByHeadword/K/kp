Quote:  Examples [of prison acronyms] include.. <i>K.P.</i> for <i>King Pin</i>, a leader who has gained his position from violence, or from being the one in control, the one who solves any problems; and occasionally for <i>Kackle Pants</i>, a satiric derivative of <i>King Pin</i>, an inmate who thinks he is in control when he is not.
