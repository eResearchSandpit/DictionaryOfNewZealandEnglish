Quote:  There is scarcely a bare stem to be seen, even the tallest are embraced by a variety of twining plants, parasites and creepers, amongst which the <i>kia-kia</i>, decked at every joint with bunches of iris-shaped leaves, and the <i>mangamanga,</i> a creeping fern, are the most conspicuous; the <i>kareo,</i> also, forming a network of cane-like stems, hangs its bunches of glossy leaves pendant from every bough, and many others of equal beauty join to form a verdant arch, midway between the spreading branches of the noble trees to which they cling.
