Quote:  The name comes from a 14th-century kohanga reo movement. Provencal ... was the predominant literary and poetic language, but there were fears it was dying for lack of everyday use. A group of culture vultures formed The Very Gay Company of the Seven Troubadors of Toulouse to stop the rot.

Quote:  The gate across the road into the Nga Hau e Wha Christchurch National marae is chained and double- padlocked. Behind the palisade fence the weeds are knee high. The whare nui is boarded up ... None of its carvings and tukutuku are in place and the carvings are still tapu. The whare wananga beside it, meant to house the kohanga reo, lies uncompleted, torn building paper flapping.
