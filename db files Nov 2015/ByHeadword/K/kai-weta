Quote:  <i>Carpodetus serratus (The Serrate Carpodetus)</i>... The native name <i>Puta-puta-weta</i> signifies full of weta holes. in the North island trees of this species are rarely cut down unperforated by longitudinal insect galleries. Another name by which it is known is

<i>Puna-weta. </i>in the Urewera country it is called <i>Kai-weta</i> (i.e., weta food). [That ugly innocent the weta (<i>Deinacrida</i>) has thus been accused of perforating the tree; but as a matter of fact though often used as convenient residences [195] by the weta, the holes are made by the caterpillar of the large moth <i>Hepialus virescens...</i> ].
