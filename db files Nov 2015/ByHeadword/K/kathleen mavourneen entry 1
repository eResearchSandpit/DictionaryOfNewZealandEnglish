Quote:  New Zealand has now introduced `habitual criminals' legislation..... The criminal classes, with caustic wit, christened the obnoxious measure the `Kathleen Mavourneen' Act, the allusion being to a familiar line in that most pathetic and charming ballad- `it may be for years, and it may be for ever'. [Phs refers to the NSW act which may have been named thus before the NZ act was passed]

Quote:  A rare example of real ... wit in the criminal class is `Kathleen Mavourneen' or `kath' for an indeterminate sentence. This dates from about 1910 and originated either in New Zealand or in Australia. i remember well the delight with which it was told to me by the late Mr Justice O.T.J. Alpers who had come upon it in the course of his practice as a barrister. This was about 1910. Another fancy term for this tantalising sentence, `Cat and Mouse', is also clever and witty but less poetical.
