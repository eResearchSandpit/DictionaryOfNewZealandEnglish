Quote:  Kate Mitchell raises an fascinating point about the phrase "the big kahuna"... Where it gets interesting, though, is finding references to similar words beginning with t- instead of k-, the sort of consonant transliteration not uncommon in Polynesian languages... Throughout the eastern Pacific the words tahunga and tahuna crop up for people with special powers such as priests and sorcerers. it doesn't take much imagination to see a relationship with our own Maori tohunga, the word for a priest or specially skilled person.
