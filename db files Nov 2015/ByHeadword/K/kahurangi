Quote:  Among the Maori, considerations of aesthetic interest helped quite materially ... to decide

the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu, </i> the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the<i> inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.

Quote:  Kahurangi is the rarest variety of pounamu. it is highly translucent and often comes in vivid shades of green.  Kahurangi is particularly esteemed by Maori.  in the past, it was the preferred variety of stone for the blades of toki poutangata (ceremonial adzes) owned by rangatira, (chiefs).
