When the wearer begins to sweat under the exertion of carrying a load, a patch of sweat appears on his clothes where his back chafes against the pack.

Quote:  The two main varieties of packs are the <i>frame pack</i> and the <i>frameless pack,</i> sometimes called a <i>flat pack</i>. The frameless pack of course receives that name only on formal occasions, being more familiarly known by that elegant term, <i>kidney-rotter</i>, or less frequently as<i> kidney-buster, kidney-crusher, kidney-sweater </i>or <i>kidney-rider. </i>
