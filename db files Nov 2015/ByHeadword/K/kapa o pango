Quote:  For a start, there's the fact <i>Kapo O Pango</i> already is a celebration of the multicultural All Blacks/New Zealand.  Anyone with an inkling of understanding of Pacific island culture will see that it is a blend of haka (New Zealand), cibi (Fiji), kailao (Tonga) and siva tau (Samoa).  Possibly the sad truth behind all this carry-on is that those in the so-called home countries simply don't like seeing the natives stamping their feet and standing strong.
