Quote:  Kb locos were built at Dunedin's Hillside workshops in the late 1930s for service in the South island,particularly the steep line up to Arthur's Pass. The main difference between Kbs and the usual K class engine is that they have an additional booster engine under the cab, which gives an extra 6000 pounds of tractive effort.
