Quote:  The sea also brought them snapper, mullet, parore and flounder; whitebait in season; and oysters, pipi and karahu (periwinkles).. But you had to cook karahu properly. You washed the mud off, put them in cold water on the fire, and the almost let them boil. Just before they boil you see a white piece coming out from the inside.
