Quote:  i think levers should be placed on all levels, so that he [mine engine-driver] could pull the knocker, instead of at the present time he has to put his head out in the shaft and perhaps have to pull about 100-1500 [sic] feet of line. i think there should be a stiff penalty as to anyone being allowed to handle the knocker line except the person in charge, as it tends to confuse the enginedriver.
