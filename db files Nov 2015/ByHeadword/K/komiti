Quote:   ... on one occasion [in the 1850s] during the sittings of the General Assembly, the outside of the house was beseiged by crowds of Natives, listening and wondering what the white people inside could possible be doing, and whether they were holding a secret meeting or runanga to kill the Maories! He [Mr. Rogan\} remarks that at this time the Maories first adopted the term `runanga,' the term `komiti' having previously been used by them in respect to deliberative meetings.
