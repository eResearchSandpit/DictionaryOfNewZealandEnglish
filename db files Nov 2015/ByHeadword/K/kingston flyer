Quote:  On this day in 1971 - just two months after the last scheduled steam train service in the country - the vintage steam train the Kingston Flyer began a tourist run from Lake Wakatipu to Lumsden. After several owners and a changed run - it now plies between Kingston and Fairlight [sic] three times a day from September until mid-May - the Flyer is still charming tourists... The operators cannot guess how many people have travelled on the Kingston Flyer since 1971, but say it must run into "the hundreds of thousands".

Quote:  Unfortunately, we don't get time to linger because we've a train to catch - the Kingston Flyer. Based on the southern shores of Lake Wakatipu, the original flyer operated till the 1950s between Kingston and Gore, but today is restricted to a 14-kilometre stretch of track between Kingston and Fairlight.
