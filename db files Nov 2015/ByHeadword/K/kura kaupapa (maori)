Quote:  i believe some of the students who go through kohanga reo and kura kaupapa develop a kind of Maori and English bilingualism that enable them to move socially through both languages while having access to continue to improve their Maori. Kura kaupapa is especially exciting for the reason that it deals with quite difficult pragmatic problems in running small individual schools while facing major philosophical problems such as what is the goal of schooling and what are we doing about it.
