Quote:  Outside of a university professor or two, not many New Zealanders can say they have created a new breed of sheep but Roger Marshall can. The Rangitikei farmer's Kelso breed is firmly established as a producer of meaty, high-performance sheep. The Kelsos are a composite of Finn and Texel on a Coopworth-Romney base, with a dash of East Friesian. Starting by mating Finns to his Coopworth-Romneys, and then adding Texels and a small number of East Friesians, it took him five years to develop the Kelso. in all, 11000 Kelso ewes are spread across six farms.
