Their reigning potentate was Tawhiao, son of their first king, old Potatau, who died a short time before this period. The idea of having a king, or the king movement, was started by Wiremu Thompson, one of the leading Waikato chiefs, who was afterwards called `the King-maker'. <i>ibid.</i> 9 The Kingites, as the Waikatos styled themselves, were so called on account of their having set up for themselves a king.
