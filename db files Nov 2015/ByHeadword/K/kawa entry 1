Quote:  Kawa - often confused in meaning with, or <i>used as a substitute for</i>, nga <i>tikanga o te marae</i> (q.v.) which refers to the <i>customs</i> or protocol accepted on a marae. These may differ from marae to marae. (The term comes from `pare kawakawa', the wreaths of leaves worn at a tangi). Williams dictionary gives 9 meanings for kawa, most of which seem to relate to the practice of removing a tapu by a special ceremony.
