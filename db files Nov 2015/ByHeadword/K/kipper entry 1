Quote:  <i>MULLET, YELLOW-EYED </i> (a) Scientific name: <i>Aldrichetta forsteri</i>. (b) Suggested commercial name[s]: Sea Mullet; New Zealand Kipper (smoked); Rollmops (pickled). (c) Other common names: Herring (in error and best dropped); Common Mullet; Sprat (in error). (d) Principal localities where taken: Tauranga, kaipara, lake Ellesmere. ... The name `Herring' has been applied widely and for a long time to the New Zealand Yelloweyed Mullet which is not a Clupeid and therefore only very distantly related to the true Herring of European waters.
