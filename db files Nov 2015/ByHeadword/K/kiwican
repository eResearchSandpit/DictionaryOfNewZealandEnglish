Quote:  [Hdg] Kiwican programme faces cash shortage. An educational programme embraced by schools, business leaders and the Labour Party faces an uncertain future as no one can decide how much money it needs...Auckland philanthropist Bob Wickham started Kiwican after watching a police programme work with troubled teenagers...  "Kiwican teaches simple things like 'graffiti is wrong.'"
