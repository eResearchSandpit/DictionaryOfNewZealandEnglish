kerosene tin
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:R.Mason notes `This might deserve mention if only to compare with the early stages of the billy. Any 4-gallon tin of the standard size and shape [ ] is called a `kerosene tin', even if it had held benzine (as often in the twenties before the days of bowsers), oil or meths. A standard utensil'. Kerosene tins were put to innumerable domestic, farming, trade and private uses, as buckets, utensils, containers, or (flattened out) building material up to the 1939-45 War, since when they have been gradually replaced by other containers etc. (in some pronunciations almost a special compound [kero / si:ntin], as its frequent hyphenation would indicate.)
