Quote:  Otane was one of a series of highly successful wheat cultivars Dr McEwan, always thinking a decade ahead, bred while working for the DSiR. Others.. were Karamu (1979), Rongotea and Oroua (both 1979). They were grown from Southland to Waikato, as was Endeavour (1994). He was best known for his work in wheat but he also worked in oats and barley, naming one, a black feed oat, Finlay, after an early All Black, Jack Finlay.
