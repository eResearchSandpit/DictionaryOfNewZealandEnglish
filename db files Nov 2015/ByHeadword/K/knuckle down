Quote:  Action terms which refer to the shooting of the marbles are: Knuckle down Stiff, Knee High, Funks [Flunks sic] or Funnicks, Slips, Firsts and Lasts and Forces. ... The term `Knuckle down Stiff' (Taranaki [18]80, Gisborne [18]85, Waitara [18]95) is mentioned by [Lady A.B. Gomme Vo. 1, p.113]. ... As Taranaki [18]80 says, `The term was called out in order to prevent too easy a success against a marble near the ring'. it was less advantageous to fire with the hand on the ground than with the hand elevated, perhaps at `Knee High'.

Quote:  Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. if a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.
