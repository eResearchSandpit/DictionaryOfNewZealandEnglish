Quote:  These king fleeces are crafty old ewes who have been too shrewd to be caught in the muster ... Their special value was that, having missed the shearing, they carried enormous fleeces - hence the name, king fleeces. <i>ibid.</i> 83 We came here for kings: when they see him safely out there, they'll come out to.
