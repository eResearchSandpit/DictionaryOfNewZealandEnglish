Notes: the fruit of the Fuchsia excorticata; often mistakenly applied to the tree itself (more properly kotukutuku); an error poss. reinforced or compounded by the entries in early Williams Dictonary: for the tree not the berry is not in the 3rd 1871 edition (check earlier editions): possibly the common error started with the mistaken entry in the 4th edn 1892, corrected in the 1917 (1921) 157 to Fruit of <i>Fuchsia excorticata (kootukutuku</i> is in all edns from 1871 correctly glossed).
