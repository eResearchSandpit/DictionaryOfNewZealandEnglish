Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The entries in DNZE and NZPOD need modification and updating. Doubtless originally feral, the kunekune is a registered breed of domestic pig, much favoured by lifestylers. See article Pigs Might Fly, <i>Growing Today</i>, Feb. 1995, 49 and ad in same magazine May 1995 - "Kunekune boar registered pedigree."

Quote:  if animals had their pop. charts, New Zealand's kune kune pig would have to find a high place among the list of unusual animals. Even those most closely attached to the kune kune shake their heads over them. it's surprising, therefore, that such a rare character should be so little known and so little appreciated - and that so few are aware of how close kune kune pigs are to becoming extinct. TESSA WARD continues her series of articles.

Quote:  New Zealand has never had a native pig. The <i>Dominion</i> newspaper, National Radio's <i>Rural Report</i>, and the 12.30 National News are all in the process of perpetrating a myth. Each of their news items told of a `rare native pig - the kunekune'. Dr Clive Dalton, of Ruakura Animal Research Station, said that only about 80 of these small round pigs remain; ... No trace of pig of any species has been excavated from archaic sites in this country.... The kunekune pigs are likely to have been brought to New Zealand by the Chinese coming to the goldmines of central Otago and for that reason as a special breed are well worthy of preservation.

Quote:  New owners should be aware that a Kunekune boar is still a sizeable male animal which, like all pigs, will have a healthy appetite for a bit of meat as well as standard vegetables. Young lambs and young children should be watched around all pigs.
