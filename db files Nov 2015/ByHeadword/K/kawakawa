Quote:  Kawakawa is the most common variety of pounamu.   it comes in many shades - from strong rich green to dark green - and often has small dark flecks, called inclusions, which add to its character.   Variations of kawakawa include the olive-gree raukaraka and totoweka pounamu, which has reddish spots and streaks.

Quote:  Among the Maori, considerations of aesthetic interest helped quite materially ... to decide

the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu, </i>the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the<i> inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.

Quote:  `The jade, the pounamu ... it's a beautiful stone ... Look,' he said, holding up a long hooked ear-drop of pearly translucence, `that's tau tau and the stone is called inanga. And this, the pekapeka - they say the shape comes from the bat. This is for the ear, too - the mako, like a shark's tooth ... And these,' - he ran his fingers along a row of ... nephrite adzes - `toki. See this one' - he held the heavy red-mottled adze in his palm - `that's the red kind, totoweka, woodhen's blood. The deep green, that's kawakawa.'
