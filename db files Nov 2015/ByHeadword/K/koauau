Quote:  After dinner the old man produced his flute; it was not a koauau: it was a piece of gas pipe about 10 inches long, with three holes at the lower end ... whilst the metal was not so melodious as the wood, nor so mellow, the result was pleasing and sounded very well.

Quote:  On Sunday, he will play the koauau - an end-blown flute - the putorino - an instrument that is both flute and trumpet at the same time - the pukaea - a "lusty and spectacular" six-foot long trumpet - and the nguru - a tiny wooden flute played with the nose. ...

Listen closely and you might just hear the evocative sound of a Maori flute. You may never have seen a koauau, but the sounds of the instrument, and others like it, permeate our homes and workplaces almost every day.
