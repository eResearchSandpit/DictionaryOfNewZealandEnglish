Quote:  Another highly perfumed native plant growing there [New Plymouth] was the koheriki (aniseed - Angelica rosaefolia) highly appreciated by shepherds as well as their flocks. in fact, shepherds are so fond of it that it is becoming scarce in a wild state, and shepherds often dry the leaves and rub them up in their tobacco to give it an aroma. Koheriki is a little plant 1ft to 2 ft in height that is very suitable on rock-work in the open.
