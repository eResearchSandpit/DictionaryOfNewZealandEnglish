Quote:  Kokopu species and  koaro were widespread in the [Wellington] region, but the annual whitebait catch, silting up of waterways, and culverting streams interrupted their life cycles... "Banded kokopu are remarkably aggressive colonisers, they can climb steep damp places, but they sure as hell can't fly."... Kokopu had been found in stormwater drains, toby holes, and hidden under leaves on moist ground. The fish could breathe through damp skin, because they lacked scales.
