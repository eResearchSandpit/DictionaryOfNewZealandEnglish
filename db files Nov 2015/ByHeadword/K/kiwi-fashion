Quote:  Each moving in his own little world, each following instinctively his cobber ten paces in front ... the jolting of the water-bottle swung on the rear, Kiwi-fashion, ... and the black swing of the besmoked brew-can carried by the section leader for the Kiwis are in the dugouts brewing up the chai.
