Quote:  Not that she cared about appearances. She earned extra money when she could and in her third year had a `Kathleen Mavourneen' loan arranged through the registrar. `Kathleen Mavourneen'? The tag had currency [ca 1933 at Auckland University College] from an irish song popular at community sings, with the punch line `it may be for years and it may be for ever.' Such a loan was interest-free, but Kath wasn't the sort to leave it for ever. She paid it back three years after graduating. it must have come from a private source - another of Rocke O'Shea's little dodges for keeping students keeping on.
