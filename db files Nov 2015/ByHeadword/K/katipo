Quote:  Early Maori who named the spider 'night stinger' were loath to sleep in dunes at night and even now, tales of the dreaded katipo arouse anxiety amongst driftwood collectors or those contemplating a frolic in the dunes... There are two recognised species of katipo; <i>Latrodectus katipo</i> and <i>L. atritus</i>. Both are peculiar to New Zealand and can be distinguished by the coloration [sic] of adult females. Adult female <i>L. katipo</i> are primarily velvet black with the exception of a bright red dorsal stripe and a distinctive red, hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen... in contrast, adult female <i>L. atritus</i> although almost identical in colouration and size, lack the dorsal stripe, and the red hourglass on the underside of their abdomen is less distinct.

Quote:  <i>Katipo, n.</i> a small venomous spider of New Zealand and Australia. The name is Maori. The scientific name is<i> Latrodectus scelio, </i>Thorel. in New Zealand, it is generally found on the beach under old driftwood; but in Australia it is found widely scattered over the Continent, and always frequents dark sheltered spots.
