Quote:  The distinction between a. Plunket nurse and a Karitane is an important one. Plunket nurses must be registered nurses before they embark on the 17-week Plunket training course and they often have additional midwifery or nursing qualifications. Karitanes have basic child-care training with no nursing qualification required.
