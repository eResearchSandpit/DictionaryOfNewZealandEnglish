Quote:  The principal sorts of cloak or mantle at present made by the Maoris from their native flax are - 1. The `Korowai,' or shaggy mantle. 2. The `Kaitaka,' or fine mantle; and 3. The `Pokeha,' or rain cloak. Of these, the variety of flax plant called the `Koura' yields the best fibre for the `Korowai'.
