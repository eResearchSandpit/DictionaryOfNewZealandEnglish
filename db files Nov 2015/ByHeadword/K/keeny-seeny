At the cry of 'bullrush' we all ran and he had to catch one of us. it was also called Charlie across the water and kingaseeny.

Quote:  A popular game was what we in Hurleyville called Keeney-Seeney. it has a variety of other names. One person would call a boy's name out of the whole group and try to catch him and pat three times on his back before he got to the other end. if caught he would form part of the catching team. if not caught the whole school would go to the other end - any caught would form part of the catching team. The game would end with almost the whole school forming the catchers and trying to catch a rampaging All Black type. At times a rather rough game.
