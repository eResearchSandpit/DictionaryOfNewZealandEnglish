Quote:  i arrived here [at Kaitaia] on the <i>Fly</i> ... i now send her back with about 3/4 tons of Kowrie and four bales wool. ... all the Kowrie traders about here are mostly out of goods ... i think the Kowrie sent is very good and clean ... The natives are going now to dig for me on some land you formerly purchased.
