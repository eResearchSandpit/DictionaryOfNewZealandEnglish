Quote:  Of all the ground dwellers in the forest none equals in stature the DAWSONiA or KiNG MOSS <i>(Dawsonia superba)</i>, which though native also to Australia and Tasmania, nevertheless reaches its largest dimensions in the forests north of Westland, more particularly the [66] kauri forests. ... The normal height ranges from eight inches to a foot, but many specimens attain twice that height ... Truly it deserves the alternative name of GiANT MOSS.
