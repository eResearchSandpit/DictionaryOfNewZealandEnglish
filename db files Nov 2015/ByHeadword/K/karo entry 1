Definition:The word in this sense appears only in Torlesse's writings from Cant., the second 1849 form if genuine represents an uncertain hearing of Maori [r]. The plant denoted would seem to be rather the BUSH LAWYERT than MATAGOURI, and if so may represent a hearing of a *<i>karamoa</i> form of <i>taramoa</i> `lawyer' parallel with<i> karamea / taramea</i> `spear grass'. If it denotes <i>tumatakuru,</i> it perhaps represents an idiosyncratic hearing of the final- <i>kuru. </i>

Quote:  (Torlesse) There are two plants [in Canterbury], the karo (prickly thorn) and taramea (spear grass), whch are well worthy of their names, but are almost exclusively confined to the hilly regions. There generally grows near these a plant called the timuka, from the leaf of which the natives make mats and leggings, which are impervious to the sharp points of the former.
