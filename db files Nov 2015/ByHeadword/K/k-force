Quote:  There was no shortage of volunteers for the 1056-man Kayforce that 50 years ago tomorrow sailed from Wellington to fight alongside other units from the Commonwealth in the Korean War... After only three months of training, the 16th Field Regiment and a number of smaller, ancillary units, known collectively as Kayforce, sailed on December 10, 1950, on the troopship Ormonde, arriving in Pusan on New Year's Eve and going into action against North Korea and its Chinese ally less than four weeks later.

Quote:  From January 1951 through to November 1954 the 16th Field Regiment fought its way through Korea ... Those who had joined `Kay Force' soon realised that soldiering in Korea was no sinecure. <i>ibid..</i> 139 Gunner N.G. Garland, who had come to Korea with the original draft of K Force, was captured while on observation post duties with the King's Shropshire Light infantry... K Force was better equipped to face the second Korean winter, with some heated bunkers now built below ground, with warmer uniforms and better rations.
