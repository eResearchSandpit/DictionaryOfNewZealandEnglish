Quote:  The above list of fish to be caught along the Canterbury coast has some notable omissions, as hoka (red cod) ... though i am not so sure about the rawaru (blue cod). Others omitted are the tarakihi, or terakihi, the moki, the komutumutu (trevalli), the puhaiwhakarua (red-jacket), koiro (conger eel), tuere (blind eel), whai (skate), and the koekohe [sic] (trumpeter)
