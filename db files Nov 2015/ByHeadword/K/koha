Quote:  After paying an $83,000 tax bill for a Hawke's Bay health trust that paid its workers and trustees "koha", the Health Ministry has warned other trusts not to make the same request... inland Revenue said yesterday that koha is taxed at 33 per cent if it is deemed to be a payment for business... inland Revenue says, in relation to koha, "efforts on behalf of Maori" will be subjected to tax, once expenses have been deducted, because it is considered to be part of normal business income.

Quote:  A Hawke's Bay health trust paid its workers and volunteers "koha" for work done... Wellington Tenths trustee Peter Love says using koha to pay workers and volunteers is a "misinterpretation" of the ancient practice, which is restricted to particular circumstances. "That is what i know koha to be all about. it should never be paid for work like that and it's not a regular payment. it is a discreet payment that is very private between who is paying and who is getting it. it is done with reverence and solemnity."
