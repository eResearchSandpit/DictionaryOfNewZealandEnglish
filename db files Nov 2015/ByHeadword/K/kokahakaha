Quote:  it is undulating red birch country - with open patches & valleys growing tussocks, snowgrass toetoe, kokahakaha, with numbers of flowers - swampy or rather - peaty, comparatively dry now but no doubt very wet in winter. <i>ibid.</i> 7 in front and just out of the bush was an open pakihi part of the same that extends onto Mt Peel - like a very large paddock covered with snowgrass and kokahakaha (Astelia) a plant with soft silvery flaxlike leaves growing about 2 ft high.
