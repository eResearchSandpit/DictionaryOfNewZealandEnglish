Quote:  Perhaps the commonest tree [near Waikouaiti] is one that i was not aware of having seen before. it grows to a considerable size, but in a very twisted, irregular shape. its leaf is of a smooth, glossy, green colour, about the size of the leaf of a Portugal laurel, but more heart-shaped. The native name of the tree is kapuka. it is commonly called broad-leaf by the white men there. The kohai is also a very common tree in the woods, and grows to a large size.
