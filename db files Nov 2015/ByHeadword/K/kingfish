Quote:   The other name, `Southern Kingfish' [for <i>Rexea solandri</i>] is more appropriate, although it suggests affinities with another family of fishes, which are associated in New Zealand with the name of `Kingfish', namely the Carangidae or Trevally (occasionally spelt Trevalli) family, which includes the `Yellowtail' or `Kingfish' (<i>Regificola grandis</i>). <i>ibid.</i> 89 The Yellowtail or Kingfish, as it is called in Auckland, has the upper parts of the body blue, and the underparts are whitish. <i>ibid.</i> 170 Yellowtail Regificola grandis Kingfish; Yellow-tail Kingfish; Northern Kingfish

Quote:  The only true mackerels recorded from Canterbury are the Pacific Bonito (<i>Sarda chiliensis</i>) and the large-scaled Tunny (<i>Gasterochisma melampus</i>) which may reach a length of 6 feet; but a related family includes the well-known Barracouta (<i>Thyrsites atun</i>), the King Barracouta, <i>Jordanidia solandrii</i> (often known locally as Kingfish, but not to be confused with the North island Kingfish which is a form or Yellowtail) and the elongated, silvery-hued frost fish (<i>Lepidopus caudatus</i>) whose curious stranding habits can hardly yet be said to be satisfactorily explained.
