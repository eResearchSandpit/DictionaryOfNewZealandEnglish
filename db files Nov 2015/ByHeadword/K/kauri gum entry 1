Quote:  Older boys at the Primary Scvhool took the fresh, white dribbles of kauri gum from the bark of trees. This was heated in hot water and moulded into small round balls for use as chewing gum.  Unfortunately, it had a very slight oily flavour reminiscent of turpentine but this disappeared after the gum had been chewed for several hours. Brothers persuaded their younger siblings to chew the fresh gum and then repossessed it when the unwanted flavour had disappeared.
