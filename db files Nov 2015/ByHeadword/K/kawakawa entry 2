Quote:  The banks by the track are massed with kawakawa, Macropiper excelsa, their heart-shaped leaves reduced to green "lace": by resident caterpillars .. "Kawakawa contains toxins in its leaves .. When it's chewed or browsed that increases the amount of toxins it produces. The caterpillar comes along - there's only one species of caterpillar that can feed on kawakawa - it chews a hole, gets a bellyache, falls off on a little strand of silk."
