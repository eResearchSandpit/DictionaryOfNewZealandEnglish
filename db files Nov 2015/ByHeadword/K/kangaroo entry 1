Quote:  `... he advised us to get kangaroo dogs for the purpose of keeping them [wild dogs] down' ... `He was soon brought down by one of the kangaroos,' ... `one of which had tasted dingo blood in Australia.' ... when hunting the wild dog on a scent ... our kangaroos would leave it, if crossed by the fresh scent of a wild pig.
