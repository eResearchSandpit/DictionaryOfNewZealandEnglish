Quote:  `The key' took its name from its resemblance to the type of key used in the early locks. it consisted of a shaft to which a claw was attached by hinge at the side. A handle of varying design was provided to apply a turning movement to the shaft, and the tooth, held firmly by the claw, could then be dislocated from its socket.
