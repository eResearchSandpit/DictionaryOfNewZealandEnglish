Quote:  Company member Moana Nepia made his "Koru" in 1984 as one of the works in the New Moves season, and has re-worked it here. inspired by the repeated spiral motifs of Maori art this dance makes use of spiralling movement, patterns and paths to sculpt the space.

Quote:  "The koru is a stylised adaptation of a fern frond, symbolising new growth and rebirth."... The koru is the image of the "springing fern" and is seen in the art of Maori and Polynesians and, according to <i>New Zealand Traditions & Folklore</i> by Gordon Ell, has become a traditional symbol of New Zealandness in recent years, a lead that probably came from Air New Zealand.

Quote:  McLEAVEY said `Gordon Walters invented the koru'. He knows and i know that the koru has its origin in ancient Maori folk art; Walters only discovered it in the 1940s. if popular usage annexes new words to a language, we will allow Walters the distinction of being the inventor of the koru in the language of contemporary New Zealand art.

Quote:  An unfurling fern frond, the koru, is artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser's chosen symbol for a New Zealand flag... Yes, his green koru flag.. does indeed start at the black flagstaff head and then decreases sharply to where the flag is divided into two diagonal halves before curling up into a spiral at the other end.
