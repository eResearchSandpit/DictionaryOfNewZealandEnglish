Quote:  When the whaling parties [on Kapiti] were paid for their greasy work - so much a `lay' - there were lashings of rum ... and for a few days the trying-out fires and the whale-boats had a rest. ... Card play ran high ... The stakes were usually thrown into a three-legged iron pot - the `kohua' of the old-timers ...

Quote:  The third method, boiling (or <i>kohua</i>), seems to have been used more rarely. Because the Maori did not make pottery, their only means of heating a liquid was by dropping a red-hot stone into a wooden bowl containing the liquid.
