Quote:  One common prank was Knick Knock. in this game, children knocked on someone's door, then ran away, but it could be played more elaborately: in Tick Tack we stuck a pin into the middle sash of a window; a button was suspended from this on a piece of cotton. Then a long length of cotton was attached to the smaller piece and led away to the gate. The cotton was pulled every now and then and the button tapped against the window. it was nighttime, and folks would pull up the blind and peer out. Some more adventurous spirits would come out and investigate and would maybe get entangled with the cotton. Then the culprit would run away to some other house. (1900; Moeraki)
