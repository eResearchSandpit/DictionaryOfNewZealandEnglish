Quote:  The schedule typically penalises underweight and overfat lambs. if using scales to draft up to a limit, you should always analyse last year's kill sheets very closely to more accurately assess the killing out percentage .. if you are using an agent you should check the consistency and accuracy of your drafter against the killing sheets.
