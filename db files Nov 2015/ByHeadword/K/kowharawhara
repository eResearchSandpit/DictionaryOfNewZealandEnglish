Quote:  [No New Zealand flowers are] remarkable for either beauty or fragrance except Kaha Kaha, Wara Wara [Kowharawhara] and the Papapa (or the Parpuppa). The Kahakaha are fragrant and oderous [sic]; it varies in colors sometimes being dark and sometimes of a light pink and yellow.... The Wara Wara flower resembles the Rahakah a little, only larger, and the flower clustering together round the stem, forming a round featherlike appearance, mostly yellow, with a fragrant and sweet smell...
