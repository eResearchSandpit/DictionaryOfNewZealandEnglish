Notes: [HWO writes 1984 to enquirer: I have an idea that <i>Kiwi</i>, the name of its competitor bootpolish, was given to that product in England before the First World War, because it was originally a brown boot polish. It's amusing that <i>nugget</i> should become a well-known word in New Zealand for bootpolish, and <i>Kiwi</i> merely remain the name of a brand here. One might expect that it would have been the other way around.]

Quote:   in Covent Garden i saw kumeras being sold under that name. `The words `Kiwi' and `Kia-ora' were familiar to everyone partly as trade names for boot-polish and Lemonade [sic]], but also their meanings were generally known. i understand that Kiwi is used in U.S.A. as a name for ground staff at airfields because they don't fly.
