Notes: (a continuation of 3), (? espec. a Pakeha male) >[get dateline from HORI] [Mr Herewini said that the term `Hori"] is becoming distasteful to many - but the Kiwi and the Maori let it go because we know we don't mean it in a distasteful way.

Quote:  Someone once asked in a fit of unpatriotic pique, "what kind of symbol is a big-arsed flightless bird?" The public bar response is inevitably, "A good kiwi eats roots and leaves." But the commonest feeling is one of intense identification. We <i>are</i> Kiwis - rare and special ground-dwelling creatures.

Quote:   in every New Zealand poet, almost, there is a streak of the `Kiwi' - our word for patriotic common man - who disapproves, distrusts, or despises the personal voice. And the `Kiwi', though the term is of recent adoption, and for all his insecurity and raucousness, is a bird of some social ancestry. Our Victorian founders, by the mere act of turning colonist, made irrevocable divorce out of their century's separation of the poetic and the practical.
