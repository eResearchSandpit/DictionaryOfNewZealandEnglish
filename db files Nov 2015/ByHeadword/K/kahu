Quote:  Owing to the misapplication of the native names, Kahu and karearea, in Mr. Gray's first list [in Dieffenbach], writers in this country have inevitably fallen into the error of considering our large brown hawk the <i> Falco harpe </i> and our `Sparrow-hawk' the <i> Falco brunnea </i>, of that author.

Quote:  For instance, when comparing the two governors, Sir George Grey and Sir George Bowen, they [the Maori MPs] compared the former to a <i> kahu </i> (hawk) which flies overhead - one can always tell what it is doing; while they likened Sir George Bowen to a <i> kiori </i> (rat) which burrows underground - one never knows where it is coming up.
