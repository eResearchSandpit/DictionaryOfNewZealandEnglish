Quote:  The tide was ebbing, and had left the beach red with `kouraraki,' a small crustaceous animal not unlike the shrimp, but more diminutive. They were still alive, and so numerous that they formed a stratum three or four inches thick, to walk over which was as if one trod on new-fallen snow. The `kouraraki' are fed on by the whale; and their appearance early, and in abundance, was hailed as the prognostic of a good season.
