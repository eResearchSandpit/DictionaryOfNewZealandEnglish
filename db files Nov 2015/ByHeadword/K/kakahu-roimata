Quote:   `August 15th. - When an husband dies the widow laments and lives in a small house called the aretaua <i>(Whare-taua)</i>, making mats to wrap the corpse in when taken up again. She must not wet her fingers with her spittle while making the mats, called watu-tangi-knitting - crying <i>(Whatu-tangi)</i>; the mat is called kakaho-wroimate, mat (of) tears, or bed-wet-with-tears-while-making <i>(Kakahu-roimata)</i>, a mat of sorrow; a widow of Rangeehoo (Rangihoua) made two for her departed husband and one for herself.
