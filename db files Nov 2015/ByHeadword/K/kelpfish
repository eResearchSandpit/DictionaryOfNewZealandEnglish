Quote:  Wrasse, parrot-fish, and spotties are often in the market. There are two kinds of spotties, a big and a little. The wrasse and the parrot-fish are mostly caught outside amongst the kelp, and these, with the spotty, are indiscriminately called [by Otago fishermen] kelp-fish by the fishermen. [?prob. Pseudolabrus celidotus the spotty]

Quote:  SPOTTY (<i>Labrichthys bothrycosmus</i>). ... [92] According to Mr. Thompson's observations, the spotty is also known in Dunedin as the butter-fish, as when writing in 1877, he said: `The spotty, or butter-fish of our local fishermen, has been very plentiful this year, and had been brought to town in large numbers at times; was in the market 128 days, as against thirty-four days for last year.' ... adding in the most tantalizing manner possible, `There are two sorts of spotty - a big and a little.' And then, after saying the fishermen called them kelp-fish, writes: `Spotties in market 154 days'.
