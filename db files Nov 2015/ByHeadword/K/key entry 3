Quote:  it was quite a common practice for experienced bushmen, to have a `drive'. if you are chopping up a `face' and there is a large tree behind you further up the face, you select that as the `key'. To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree. When all is ready and you have worked back to the key, you scarf it very carefully. ... if everything goes according to plan it will `drive' the one below, which will in turn drive the next, and so on ...
