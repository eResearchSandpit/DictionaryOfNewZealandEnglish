Quote:  The major protagonists at the 1935 election, however, were Labour and the United-Reform coalition, which had merged formally in May 1935 into a National Political Federation, becoming in 1936, after the election, the New Zealand National Party. The `Kelly Gang' of Eliot and Ernest Davis and Oliver Nicholson in Auckland worked hard to prevent conservative notables from defecting from National to the Democrats, even to the extent of offering jobs and directorships.
