Quote:  in September 1864 the diggers' dogs were such a menace to the flocks that Murisons sent over to Hamilton's run for the loan of a `kangaroo hound.' These big dogs of a boarhound type were imported from Australia to Otago in the 'fifties to aid in the extinction of the real wild dogs then so common in the backblocks.
