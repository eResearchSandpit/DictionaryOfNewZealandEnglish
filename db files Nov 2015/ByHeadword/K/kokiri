Quote:  i observed in one of the canoes a very singular fish, which the natives call cokiddie, or the spear-fish. it was about the size of a perch, and shaped very like it, except the head, which was rather [23] oblong, like that of a pig; its skin was quite rough, and behind its head nature had armed it with a sharp bone, about two inches long, which it could extrude and draw in at pleasure. it was from this bone that the natives gave it the name of cokiddie, which signifies

spear in their language, and therefore appropriate enough.
