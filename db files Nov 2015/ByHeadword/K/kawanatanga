Quote:  But Maori also conceded "kawanatanga" or "governorship" in article 1... Just as "rangatiratanga" is an important power, so is "kawanatanga"... Whereas some Maori need to pull back from some of the stands that have been taken, the Government needs to recognise that it has not lived up to its full responsibility for kawanatanga.

Quote:  As to the former, is it true they surrendered to the Queen the `Kawanatanga' - the governorship - or sovereignty; but they did not undestand that they thereby surrendered the right of self-government over their internal affairs, a right which we never claimed or exercised, and could not in fact exercise.

Quote:  The New Zealand Maori Council has explained the concept of Rangatiratanga as meaning more than `possession': `it means the wise administration of all the assets possessed by a group for that group's benefit: in a word, trusteeship' (<i>Te Wahanga Tuatahi</i>, 1983, p 5) in the Crown's view, the First and Second Articles of the Treaty are both strong statements which necessarily qualify one another. <i>Kawanatanga</i> is subject to a promise to protect <i>Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga</i> is subject to an acknowledgment of <i>Kawanatanga</i>. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... it is the <i>right</i> of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or <i>Kawanatanga</i> in such matters.
