Quote:  Native dune plants are giving way in many areas to the introduced perennial Kikuyu grass, partly because this is one of the few plants that can withstand (and even flourish) when trampled by people or livestock or when driven over by vehicles... Kikuyu is the name of a large, agricultural, Bantu-speaking, ethnic group of south-central Kenya, the country to which the grass is native.
