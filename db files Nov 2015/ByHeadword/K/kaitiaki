Quote:  There is a feeling that kai tiaki, tohunga and multiple gods are still more things that Pakeha have taken away from Maori and that have to be got back... "The trouble is, when a Maori talks about Maori spirituality, it tends to get abused ... But i'm not sure that [kai tiaki] is an awful lot different from the notion of an angel." <i>ibid.</i> 23 "When a Maori leader like Dover or Tariana says they are going back to consult their people at home, they don't necessarily just mean <i>those</i> people. They mean ancestors ... kai tiaki."
