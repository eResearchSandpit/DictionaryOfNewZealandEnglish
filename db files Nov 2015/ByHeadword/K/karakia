Notes: The application of the word to public worship is, of course, modern.': the noun is recorded in Maori contexts only, e.g. 1874 Johnstone, Maori 193 note - incantations - In their use of this word the Maoris had no idea of prayer, and it is a mistake to attach that meaning to karakia. The verb is recorded in English form, and is mainly confined to in ???19th century use.
