Quote:  The best example of a crowning ceremony is one that was called Kinging. in this ceremony the captive was patted on the head while he lay flat on the ground with other players astride him. if he managed to move during the ceremony, then the rhyme must begin again. `Kingy-seeny, one two three, You're the very man for me ...'
