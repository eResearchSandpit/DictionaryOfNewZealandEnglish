Quote:  PiTTOSPORUM TENUiFOLiUM (<i>Banks & Sol.</i>) ... This small evergreen tree, known by the native names of `Kowhiwhi' and `Maupariki', abounds on the eastern coasts of both islands. ... Even as firewood it is despised, and bears the all too suggestive name of `Bucket of Water Wood', so little is it calculated by its combustive qualities to enliven the domestic hearth. <i>ibid.</i> 177 Kowhiwhi [Maori name] .. Kowhiwhi [Settlers' name] .. Pittosporum tenuifolium .. Small tree <i>ibid.</i> 178 Maupariki [Maori name] .. Kowhiwhi [Settlers' name] .. Pittosporum tenuifolium .. Small tree
