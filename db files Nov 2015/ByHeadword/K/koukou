Quote:  <i>ruru, koukou,</i> an owl (Ninox novaeseelandiae), morepork: the name, which is echoic, should really be kroukrou; but as the Maori disliked the sound of paired consonants, the two forms resulted according to the sound more prominent to the ear of the name-giver - koukou, or ruru: ruru much the more common.
