Quote:  The smallest garment woven is called the <i>patai</i>[a1-acute], principally worn by females for an inner garment; the <i>korowai</i> differs but little from the former, except in having a deep fringe of knotted flax strings. The <i>tatata</i> [as-acute] is similar in size to the former, having pending from every part, an infinity of small cords six inches long, of no use or ornament; its origin must be ascribed to the arbitrary taste of fashion,

Quote:  The principal sorts of cloak or mantle at present made by the Maoris from their native flax are - 1. The `Korowai,' or shaggy mantle. 2. The `Kaitaka,' or fine mantle; and 3. The `Pokeha,' or rain cloak. Of these, the variety of flax plant called the `Koura' yields the best fibre for the `Korowai'.
