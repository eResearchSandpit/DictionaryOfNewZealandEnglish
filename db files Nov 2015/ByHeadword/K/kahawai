Quote:  New Zealanders are outdoors people and part of many Kiwis' upbringing includes going fishing, for kahawai off the beach, rocks or local wharf. Grandparents and even parents remember giant schools of kahawai churning up the sea within a stone's throw of the shore. That abundance and the fish's fighting qualities made the kahawai the "people's fish".
