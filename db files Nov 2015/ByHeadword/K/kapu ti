Quote:  i would like to draw your attention to the Maori term used for a long time in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and in the National Museum of New Zealand before Te Papa was set up, for a tea break - kapu ti - i am told it means in Maori just what it sounds, i.e. it is not a joke, but i think it is just a delight and no wonder it has been used here freely and without complaint from our extensive bicultural staff... The word "hinetama" is the formal name for one of the smaller meeting rooms in the main Te Papa waterfront complex.
