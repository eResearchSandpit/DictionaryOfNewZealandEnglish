Quote:  To have shepherded the now famous all-soldier `Kiwis Revue' through an Australian tour which began in April, 1946, and to finish up with the company smiling, successful and intact in 1950 is no mean achievement. This responsibility has been that of Terry Vaughan, the Kiwis Producer and Musical Director. However, it is no new task to him, having been with the Kiwis ever since their inception in the Middle East in 1941 when the 2nd N.Z.E.F. formed its own Entertainment Unit with men of the Division. Sir Bernard Freyberg, V.C., now His Excellency the Governor General of New Zealand, has always kept a paternal eye on his `Kiwi Concert Party'.
