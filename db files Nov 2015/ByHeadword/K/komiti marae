Quote:  The Maori Councils Act 1900 was intended to provide twenty-six proclaimed districts with an elected "komiti marae". The councils had power over liquor infractions, often building upon the pre-existing local committees of elders which in many instances had already introduced regulation of alcolhol onto their marae.
