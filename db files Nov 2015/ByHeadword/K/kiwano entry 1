Notes: Registered trademark name for the African horned melon, Cucumis metaliferus (fam. Cucurbitaceae), a native of the Kalahari Desert introduced to New Zealand around 1920, the name invented by grower Sharyn Morris to combine Kiwi, 'an' (for its delicate banana flavour) and 'o' (as in the endings of other exotics such as pepino, babaco, tamarillo); also known as Mexican fruit salad, spiny cucumber and jelly melon.

Quote:  Kiwanos even attained a top shelf image in their first major export season - they were on sale in the exclusive Harrods in London... Morris even has an experimental batch of Kiwano wine "fermenting out the back".

Quote:  The family of Cucumis metuliferus is alive and well in Kaukapakapa, North Auckland, but they could be classed as undesirables and possibly prohibited from travelling to the United States. Cucumis metuliferus is the botanical name for a relatively new development in New Zealand horticulture. it is the kiwano, sometimes known as horned melon, African horned cucumber, or jelly melon, and is thought to have originated in tropical Africa.
