Quote:  Hard on the heels of the Black Ferns have come the Kiwi Ferns, their counterparts in rugby league, the men's international team having long been referred to as the Kiwis. (The New Zealand women were pitted against the touring Lionesses from Great Britain in recent test matches.)    These two rugby coinages will greatly strengthen an association between ferns and New Zealand sportswomen, though the inevitable abbreviation Ferns (the union men having already appropriated Blacks) will now be ambiguous out of context. Singular forms Black Fern and Kiwi Fern are now predictable, with the stress likely to settle on the first element rather than, as in Silver Fern, on the second (compare Black Caps and others below).
