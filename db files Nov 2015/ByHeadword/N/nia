Quote: If Mount Victoria's designation as a `neighbourhood improvement area' leads to an increase in rents, most tenants could afford to remain. ...  A town planner, ...interviewed households in the `nia,' which is bounded by Brougham, Austin, Pirie, and Elizabeth streets, ... The information will be used in conjunction with the report being prepared on housing ownership patterns in the three `nias.'
