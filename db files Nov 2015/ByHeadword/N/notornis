Quote: <i>Notornis, n.</i> a bird of New Zealand allied to the <i>Porphyrio</i> (q.v.), first described from a fossil skull by Professor Owen (1848), and then thought to be extinct, like the Moa. Professor Owen called the bird <i>Notornis mantelli</i>, and, curiously enough, Mr Walter Mantell, in whose honour the bird was named, two years afterwards captured a live specimen; a third specimen was captured in 1879....  The Maori names were <i>Moho</i> and <i>Takahe</i>(q.v.).
