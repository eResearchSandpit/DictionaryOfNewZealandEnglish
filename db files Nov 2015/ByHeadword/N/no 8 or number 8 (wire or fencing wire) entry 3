Quote: No! - let me tell you about No 8 fencing wire... You might notice its ingenious usage, from makeshift umbrella spokes to a water diving rod (one man I knew used it in his car to strap the engine block onto the mount) or again as a staple of the eternal temporary-fix we are so fond of - tying a flying fox round a tree, containing old newspapers on a shelf, even in the backblocks holding tight a wired-up broken jaw.

Quote: Turner (p. 135), gives a quotation from Crump on wire. I think `A piece of No 8' is well-enough established in farming jargon to deserve a place as No 8, signifying 8-gauge fencing wire.

Quote: number 8 fencing wire: The traditional 5 wire fence on New Zealand farms is made with this stuff. In consequence it is one of the things that is always available round a farm when you need to build or repair something. It is said that some cockies can put together a landrover, a tractorand half a milk shed with nothing but a roll of number 8. Wire comes in sizes ranging from 1 to approx. 64, with 1 being the thickest. Number 8 is 5/32 of an inch or about half the diameter of a pencil.

Quote: Christoffer looked at what he supposed was a gate. It was made of barbed wire and battens strung between two strainer posts to which it was tied with No 8 fencing wire. Being the first Taranaki gate he had encountered, he studied the primitive contraption with a puzzled frown, then realised it was simplicity itself. `Just lift off this wire loop.' The gate sprang from his fingers, coiled into the air and collapsed in a tangled heap. Christoffer cursed the man who had invented it. However he had to admit that it was an efficient, cheap and easily-made thing - a sort of `instant gate'. <i>Ibid.</i> 150 The swing bridge, made of No 8 fencing wire, made a good support for the pipelines.

Quote: Innovation exponents have criticised New Zealand's "No 8 wire" philosophy as outdated and question its relevance to the country's constantly evolving national identity... Historian Jock Phillips said No 8 wire was an ingrained part of the national identity, but did not exclusively belong to New Zealand. "I think there's been a very powerful mythology about it, which you will find also in other countries ... Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States," he said.
