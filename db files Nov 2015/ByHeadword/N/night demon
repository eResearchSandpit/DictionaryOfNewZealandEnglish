Quote: <i>Majaqueus parkinsoni</i>  Gray. (Black petrel.) ... I am quite satisfied that this bird is the `Night Demon' of our diggers. I had a live one ... from Collingwood ... On windy nights the bird would become very excited, and then it would give vent to the hysterical laugh or scream from which it takes its name.
Notes: Buller
