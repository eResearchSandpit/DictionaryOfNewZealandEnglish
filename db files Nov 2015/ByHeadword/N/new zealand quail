Quote: The New Zealand Quail, which was very plentiful, is nearly extinct now: Bush-fires have burnt it, and dogs, cats, and rats have eaten it, but the Australian and Californian varieties have filled its place.

Quote: Related very closely to the still surviving Australian stubble quail, the New Zealand quail was once common in parts of the North and South Islands. Being a species living mainly in grasslands, it was more abundant in the South Island on its eastern side than in the North where its distribution was far more localised. By the mid-nineteenth century the koreke, as it was known to the Maori, was already uncommon in the North Island, though at about the same time it was still abundant in parts of Nelson and Otago. By 1870 it was regarded as having been completely exterminated in the North, and five years later the South Island populations had vanished too.
