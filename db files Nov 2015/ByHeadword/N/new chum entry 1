Quote: "Aw, may I awsk what a colonial is?" said a supercillious new chum the other day to a full-blooded Aucklander in Queen-st.  "Certainly, a colonial is an Englishman," was the answer, "with all the modern improvements."

Quote: One of the party (our new chum, who would wear a coat) not being used to river wading got giddy when he had reached the middle, and decalred he should fall, and could not go a step further; when losing both his nerve and balance at the same time, he was carried off his feet and floated down the river.

Quote: "Well I don't wonder at a new chum like you, fresh from the drawing rooms of Belgravia, being surprised at anything you see out here," replied Harold Courtney, in a tone of veiled sarcasm; "but if you knew the  circumstances you would understand that his marrying a Maori wife and settling down at Stratford was the easiest and most natural thing in the world."

Quote: I am - a New Chum.   My business is to critcise, moralise upon, compare, sketch, and, where necessary, correct or praise the peculiarities of my adopted countrymen.   First, then, arises this question: what is a 'New Chum'? and it may be answered in two ways, according to the manner in which it is asked.   For there is a real New Chum; and there is a New Chum that is ideal only.   The New Chum proper, is, I understand, a person who has but freshly come to the Colony from some part or other of the old world.   The New chum that most colonists, here, appear to have in their mind's eye, is quite a different being in most cases.   He is a pattern of neatness and elegance in his dress; of cheek and superciliousness in his deportment; of ignorance, meanness, cowardice, spiritlessness, vagueness, helplessness in time of emergency, vanity, presumption, and emptiness, in his temperament; and of all these vices, combined with effeminate and pedantic precision, in his talk.   His delight is to abuse colonial customs; to run down the local 'bigwigs'; to show contempt for the industries and pursuits of the colonists generally; and affect a languid indifference to the matters which most engage their interest.   His purse is even emptier than his head.  He is without resources and without pluck.  His ambition is at once low and unreasonable.   he puts his trust in letters of introduction, and looks for a Government billet.
