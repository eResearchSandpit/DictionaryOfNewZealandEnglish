Quote: As used in relation to weeds in New Zealand, the term `noxious' is a confusing one, as it has two distinct meanings. In a general, non-specific sense, it denotes any weed regarded as significant, for one reason or another, by the use of the term. It has, however, a precise legal meaning denoting weeds whose control and eradication are required under the provisions of the Noxious Weeds Act of 1950 and its amendments. These are the so called `noxious weeds'.
