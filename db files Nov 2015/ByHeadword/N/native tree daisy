Quote: Members of Doc's Biodiversity Wairarapa team recently discovered 15 critically endangered native tree daisies (Olearia gardnerii), a discovery likened to discovering 15 new kakapo... The tree daisy is a small tree, growing only five or six metres. It has a short lifespan of around fifty years.
