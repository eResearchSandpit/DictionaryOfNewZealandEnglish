Quote: In the flat open space behind the pa there was a pole (or niu) standing used in their new Pai Marire religion. It was about 10 feet high, square for 2 or 3 feet at top & bottom & rounded in the middle. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/155 (A.S.Atkinson) I was curious to know where the first niu, or worshipping post, was set up & when he said at Kaitake during the present war I said I did not see it there. `To you,' he said, `it was a color (flagstaff) to us it was a niu. . <i>Ibid.</i>2/228 (A.S. Atkinson) There is a flagstaff here [Waimate Plains], fenced in and surmounted by the figure of a bird, probably a kawekawea as it was a great niu or Pai Marire pole at one time.

Quote: This niu was the central symbol of worship under Te Ua's dispensation. The term was the olden Maori word  for the short sticks used by the tohunga in his mystic arts of divination, particularly before a battle. Te Ua's niu was a tall pole or flag-mast, round which the faithful were to march in procession chanting their hymns. <i>Ibid..</i> 157 A tall niu, the pole of worship, stood in the principal part of the settlement; ... There were similar niu masts at other villages ...

Quote: The central object of worship [of the new religion of Tella Haumene] was the `Niu.' The origin of this innovation was described in the following terms:-  .in 2;`The Angel Gabriel said: `Go back to your house and erect a niu.' Horopapera enquired what a niu was. The Angel replied: `A post.' Horopapera enquired for what pur- pose? The Angel replied: `To work for you for the acquirement of the languages of all the races upon the earth.''  The term `niu' was the old Maori term for the short sticks used by the tohunga priest in his mystic arts of divination, particularly before a battle.

Quote: niu, divination by means of small rods. Niu is a Polynesian name of the coconut, and in the Pacific the nut was spun in a divination rite: the Maori lost the name for the tree when he came to Newzealand, but retained it for the divinatory rite. The Hauhau fanatics gave the name niu to the pole they set up for their ceremonial dancing procession i[n] what was a horrid kind of maypole dance.

Quote: But that is Pakeha history. More significant are the Nui poles, erected in the early 1860s and well-known to canoeists who traverse the river today. The remaining two poles, at Marae-kowhai, are distinguished by their cross-arms reaching to the compass points, oneof which (Rongo Niu) has carved hands on it. From this flew the war pennants of the Pai Marire or Hauhau, around which the warriors danced prior to battle.
