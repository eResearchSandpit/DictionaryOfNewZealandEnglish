Quote: Kawakawa is sometimes called `native pepper tree' because of its hot tasting leaves, and it is in fact related to the true pepper plant of Indonesia. ... Horopito (<i>Pseudowintera axillaris</i>) with its dark green shiny leaves has also been termed `pepper tree' for the same reason, but it is not in fact related to the kawakawa.
