Quote: It's the story of a little boy whose brief encounters with a powerful grandmother create a sense of "Napierness" ("a compound of sterling silver serviette rings, the damask of napkins - or rather serviettes - and of EPNS cake forks, nestling in velvet"), as good an explanation as any for why that rough little seaport took a Hollywood-esque role in a Wells documentary about art deco... The book closes with reconciliations with parents and with place. Napierness lives on, for "the past is always in the present, and, if it doesn't visibly exist, can be re-invented on the basis of the tiniest piece of existence".
