Quote: A voyager on Cook's third voyage in <i>Discovery</i> in 1772, Dr Sparrman, notes that `the green stuffs which were cooked with pease and  broth or used as salads, consisted of wild celery (<i>Apium  prostratum</i>), wild spinach (<i>Tetragonia expansa</i>) and Cook's scurvy  grass (<i>Lepidum oleraceum</i>).' The last mentioned, known as <i>nau</i> by the Maori, has nowadays been virtually eaten out of existence by sheep and cattle.
