Quote: After the deposit [of fat] had begun, every other part simultaneously receives its share, the back and kidneys receiving the most, the former becoming `nicked', i.e. the fat is felt through the skin to be divided into two portions, from the tail head along the backbone to the top of the shoulder... 39 when you find the rump `nicked' on handling you expect to find fat on the back.
