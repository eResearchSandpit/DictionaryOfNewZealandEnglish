Quote: Sir, -I see that the Viceregal party has had good fishing in northern Southland streams. This brings up the subject of Northland in the north. Often your writers refer to Northland, the suburb, in a headline, and I have to read the text to see if they are referring to Northland up north or Northland down south here in Wellington.Couldn't we plan a key to this by referring to North Northland or Northland North (as in Palmerston North? I feel there must be some easy way out. - I am., etc.
