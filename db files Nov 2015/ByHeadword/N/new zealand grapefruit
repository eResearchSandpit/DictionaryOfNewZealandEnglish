Quote: When we were living [in South Africa] in the 1960s, we heard of a citrus orchard in Rustenberg that grew hybrod oranges named Rex Union oranges, famous for making excellent marmalade. We went to this pretty little country town and found an orchard named 'Dunedin' and bought a bag of the oranges... What surprised us was that the Rex Union oranges seemed to be identical to our New Zealand grapefruit. Many years later.. I was reading about Morrison's Orchard in Warkworth and was struck by the statement that the original grapefruit tree had come from Kawau Island and that Sir George Grey couldn't remember where he had got the plant. Grey had been Governor of Cape Province, South Africa, from 1854-1861 and was known to have brought many South African plants to New Zealand. Are 'New Zealand grapefruit', 'Rex Union oranges'?
