Quote: A ground berry, called the New Zealand strawberry by the colonists, formed an agreeable but rather insipid repast to our parched list. It tastes much like the rose apple of India. [Fn. More usually called Snow-berry, <i>Gaultheria depressa</i>.]
Notes: From the 1857 Journal of John Turnbull Thomson.
