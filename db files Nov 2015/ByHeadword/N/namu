Quote: Simulium ? Namu, or sand-fly. Polack, New Zeal., p.319. ... To some insect, of a genus allied to Simulium, is to be referred the New Zealand sand-fly alluded to in the following passage:-  `A sort of little crane-flies (tipula alis incumbentibus) became remarkably troublesome during the bad weather. They were numerous in the skirts of the woods, not half so large as gnats or musketoes, and our sailors called them sand-flies. Their sting was extremely painful. . . . All, however, were not equally affected.' Forster, Voyage, ., pp. 135, 136. `The most mischievous animals (at Dusky Bay) are the small black sand-flies, which are very numerous, and so troublesome, that they exceed everything of the kind I ever met with: wherever they bite they cause a swelling ...' Cook, Voyage in Resolution and Adventure, i., p.99.
