Quote: There were all sorts of diverting new experiences to enjoy and interesting new words and usages to master. I found, for instance, that you didn't have to be even mildly dishonest to be `crook' - only unwell. Also that while recuperating you usually passed through an intermediate state of being `not too flash' before you won back to being `near enough' again.
