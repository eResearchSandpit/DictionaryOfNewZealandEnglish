nigger
Homonym Number:
Word Class:noun
Sense Number:
Definition:an abusive and contemptuous term for MAORI relatively rare (at least in written record) since the Land Wars of the 1860's, when it was especially frequent among Taranaki settlers, regimental soldiers (?fresh from India and other colonial venues) In theRichmond-Atkinson Papers (1960), up to 1860, except for one use by Jane Maria (1860 July 171/618) and one by H. Ronalds in  his Diary of the Taranaki War (1860 Mar. 9, 1/535), it seems the personal use of A.S. Atkinson all in his private journal and not in his `public' letters. His first use is Aug 18, 1855 (see quote), thence  1856 June 10, with two more `playful' uses of negroes, the first curious (1858 Sep 19, I-429 `Consulted with Maria whether it would be well to go among the Negroes for six months to learn Maori'), the second 1859 Mar 8 I-452 `Attended conference between Negroes and Governor'.

Quote: There can be little doubt that the same cause which rendered our countrymen the objects of native dislike in India also operated here; the Maori is constantly being called a nigger and black fellow to his face, and viewed as an inferior being. 113 ibid. Before [the present Taranaki War] began some of the Europeans felt so confident of their own power to maltreat, that they were neither ashamed nor afraid to express their wish to `polish off the black niggers'.

Quote:  Skin colour and the mixture of blood which is responsible for it [sc. high visibility in a white world] are often commented on by one Maori to another. The terms `mongrel', `black mongrel', `dago', or `black nigger', for instance, are often used by Maoris either in referring to themselves or to other Maoris in the neighbourhood. Thus one informant, in introducing herself, remarked: `I'm only a mongrel' - meaning only a mixed-blood Maori.
