Quote: In other words I was a lad of some pretension - a dreamer, who soon gathered to himself a series of unlovely nicknames. Ken Robins, a young man with whom I worked, called me `Clueless Moody', the local barber coined `Nonghead', and of course `Merv the Perv' ran out of every mouth like an epidemic.
