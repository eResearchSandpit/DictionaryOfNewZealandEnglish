Quote: BLIND TORPEDO RAY OR NUMBFISH <i>Typhlonarke aysoni</i> (Hamilton)  [ibid]. 92]. This uncommon fish has several names, all of which relate to its manner of producing electricshocks, some of which are Numb-fish, Crampfish and Electric Skate. These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name.
