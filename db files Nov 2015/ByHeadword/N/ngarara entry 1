Quote:  ... they [the natives] tried much to dissuade me from the attempt [to ascend Mount Egmont], by saying that the mountain was `tapu', and that there were ngarara (crocodiles) on it, which would undoubtedly eat me; the mysterious bird `moa,' ... was also said to exist there.

Quote: There are six small harmless lizards in the colony, which are held in terror by the natives, from a superstition that bodies within the spirits of their deified ancestors revisit the earth ... In such terror do the New Zealanders hold all the above reptiles, that the very pronunciation of the word Ngarara, a general term for the whole race, makes the bravest warrior tremble.

Quote: On the 11th of June we started from the cave, called by the natives Te-ana-o Matuku, respectingwhich they tell a very interesting tale of a large ngarara, a monster in the form of an enormous  lizard, which formerly lived here, and devoured all who attempted to pass. Since they have become Christians, however, they have called it by another name, Te whare Taipo (the Devil's house), probably referring the formation of the cave, of which I shall speak more fully in the geological part of my report, to supernatural agency rather than to the hand of nature.
