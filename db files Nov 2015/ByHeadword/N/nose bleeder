Quote: As basketball in this country is growing so is the terminology to describe the sport. ... The guys that really jump, really get high, are called lightbulb changers, nose bleeders and sky walkers, and the best of them can turn the 360 (full circle) or take the alley-oop pass (ball thrown high up by the basket). They can also throw the rock (ball) down or stuff the pill (ball).
