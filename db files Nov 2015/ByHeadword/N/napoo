Quote: Another word used in general at theBritish front is "napoo"... It is acurious construction from the French "Iln'y en a plus" which means "There is notany more," and this is also how it isused - as for destroyed Ypres or Bapaumethey are "napoo," Arras, "presque napoo"-  a subtle language, and if they stealsomeone's girl, it is "Napoo all right."
