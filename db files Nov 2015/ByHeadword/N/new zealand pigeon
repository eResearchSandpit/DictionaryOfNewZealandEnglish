Quote: In the lower regions the forest was much enlivened by birds. I shot some parrots [fn Nestor meridionalis. Kaka of the natives.], pigeons [fn Columba spadicea, Lath. Kukupa.], and wattle-birds [fn Glaucopis cinerea, Gmel. Kokako.]. Among the branches of the trees hopped the neat fantail flycatcher [fn Muscicapa flabellifera, Gml. Piwakawaka.], and a social bird of a yellow colour, which has been depicted by Forster [fn Orthornyx heteroclytus, Lef. Popokatea.], and which had much the habits of the finch.

Quote: The <i>Pigeon</i> and <i>Zooe</i> are perhaps the handsomest - the former is really a magnificent bird - almost as large as a barn-door fowl, and equally invites the attention of the Ornothologist and the epicurean - the latter has two feathery [35] wattles pendent from its ear, and some few of its notes are not unlike those of the wattle bird of Van Diemen's Land.
