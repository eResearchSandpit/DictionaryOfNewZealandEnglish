Quote: If they are within easy approach and not killers but nibblers, simply mimic the call-kea and they will come right up close to be shot. Nibblers do not actually do harm, just rip the wool on the back of a sheep, and then fly off to another. Apart from that aspect one never knows when a nibbler wil become a killer.
