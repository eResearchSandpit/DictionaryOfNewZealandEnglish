Quote: The introduction of the Limited train between Auckland and Wellington made an immediate appeal to the popular imagination... The introduction of a summer running train, which took advantage of the daylight, was also 'limited in its accommodation'... It brought about a desire for more specific titles, so "Daylight Limited" and "Night Limited" became the terms commonly used in referring to them.
