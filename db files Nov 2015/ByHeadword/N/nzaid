Quote: The new government agency handling New Zealand's overseas aid was dedicated solely to elimination of extreme poverty in the world, Associate Foreign Affairs Minister Matt Robson said yesterday. From now on the $230 million-a-year overseas aid programme will be run by NZAID, a semi-autonomous ministry agency that replaces the Official Development Assistance agency.
