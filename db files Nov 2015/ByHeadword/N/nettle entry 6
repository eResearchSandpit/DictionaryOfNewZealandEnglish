Quote: STAGGERWEED (<i>Stachys arvensis</i>), also called by its English name[s] of wound wort and hedge nettle, is found abundantly in cultivated fields in the North Island and is one of the worst garden weeds in Wellington. [and less frequently in various parts of the South Island.] It is an annual with stem branched from the base,. . . The leaves are nearly heart-shaped up to an inch long, and sparingly hairy.
