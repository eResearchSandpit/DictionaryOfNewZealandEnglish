Quote: The leaves [of the ngaio] contain mannitol and ngaione. Ngaione is an optical isomer of ipomeamarone derived from the sweet potato (cf.  pomoea). Ngaione is related to furfural which has fungicidal and bactericidal powers and which has been used as a cure for athlete's foot and swimmer's itch. ... Mannitol is used medicinally.
