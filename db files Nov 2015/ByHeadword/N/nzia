Quote: The New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) and the Architects Education and Registration Board (AERB) are separately constituted but overlapping bodies established under the 1963 Architects Act... Perhaps because expulsion from the NZIA is the architectural equivalent of a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket, the institute prefers to pass all serious complaints.. on to the AERB.
