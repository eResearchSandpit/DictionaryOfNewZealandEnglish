Quote:  Native blow-flies <i>(Calliphora quadrimaculata)</i> were very much more abundant in the country districts than they are now. Mr. Mieville, who settled in the Mataura district in 1854, in his contribution to <i>Pioneer Recollections</i>, collected by Mr. H. Beattie (second series), says, `The trouble of pioneers is the bluebottle-fly, which is to be met with only in new country, where its ravages are beyond belief.'
