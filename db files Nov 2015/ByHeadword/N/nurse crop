Quote: The advisability of sowing a nurse crop with lucerne has often been discussed, but this practice seems to have arisen in the instances where there has been some doubt of obtaining a good stand. Many still continue to grow nurse crops, but the majority of farmers have dicontinued to do so. A vigorous nurse crop is bound to leave spindly lucerne plants.
