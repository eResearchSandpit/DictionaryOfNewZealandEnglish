Quote: Those strangely infantile condensations - `prezzies' and `rellies' (for presents and relatives) were bandied about on the radio quite a bit recently. It looks as if they are going to join veges, ciggy,brekky, cardy - and all the rest as OK idiom. But there is one antipodean expression that charms people internationally ... That is the word `naughty', for sexual intercourse.

It is throughout the South Seas the polite and strict analogue of `to have sexual intercourse'.
