Notes: It is collocated with the definite article in NZ usage. (as is `the South Island', `the Middle Island', but not `Stewart[s'] Island'). -->The absolute use without the article is not used by New Zealanders except (so R. Mason) Dr L. Cockayne, Dr H.H. Allan (see A Handbook of the Naturalized Flora of N.Z., D.S.I.R. Bulletin 83, e.g. 211 `... and the northern half of South Island') and G Simpson, all botanists who may have picked up the usage from Cockayne
