Quote: We saw a number of N.Z. pigeons feeding on the kamacas(?) [sic in TS: surely  karacas] or south sea laurel(?) [sic]. We reached the dismal town of Kai-koura about 3 pm. It is the most God forsaken place I ever saw and the inn is indeed fearful. The view from the window included the filthiest of pigs and a black calf in the distance. I have been reading Gladstone's pamphlet on the Vatican decrees.
