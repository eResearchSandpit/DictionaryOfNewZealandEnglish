Native
Homonym Number:
Word Class:adjective
Sense Number:
Definition:Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of  `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and  seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity  among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as  native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the  latter being the converse of exotic forest.)  The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.'

Notes:J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous.   Usage is separated below into 1. general and 2. specific applications. 1.
