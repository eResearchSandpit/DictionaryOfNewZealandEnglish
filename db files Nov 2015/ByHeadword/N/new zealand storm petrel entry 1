Oliver was one of the few dissenters, opting for full specific status for the New Zealand storm petrel in <i>The Birds of New Zealand</i>, where he wrote that as Wilson's storm petrel is "only a straggler to New Zealand and is not known, where it is found in abundance, to produce colour varieties, for the present I treat <i>maorianus,</i> of which three very similar specimens have been taken, as a separate species".
