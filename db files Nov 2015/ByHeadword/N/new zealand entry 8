Quote: The consequence [of ignoring the South Island] is, that in works which profess to describe New Zealand, the largest island of the three is not described at all. ... But it seems never to have occurred to the gentlemen who have published their `New Zealands', that it was necessary to see more than a very small portion of it, in order to describe the whole.

Quote: New Zealand is divided into two provinces, New Ulster, and New Munster, each of which is under a Lieutenant-Governor, who enacts ordinances for the province over which he presides, with the advice of a Legislative Council, composed of the officers of Government, together with a few persons nominated by the crown from amongst the inhabitants. A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster , in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province.

Quote: Of the three islands forming the Zealand group, Rakiura, or the small South Island, is the only one which possesses a native name. Since the days of Cook, the North Island has been named on old maps Eaheinomawe, and the Middle Island Tavai-poenammo. These names originated thus. When the great navigator asked the natives the name of the North Island, he was told that it was `a thing fished from the sea by Maui,' - He mea hi no Maui; and that the Middle Island was Te wahi pounamu, or `the place of the greenstone.'  When New Zealand became a British colony, the first governor, who was an Irishman, proclaimed that the North, Middle, and South Island were thenceforth to be denominated respectively New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster; and these names he selected for the colony because New Zealand, like Irelands, had no toads. This modern method of naming places by applying the epithet `New' to countries which are as old as the originals is not only incorrect, but possesses many disadvantages. The Constitution Act of 1852 discarded this unsuitable nomenclature, and the North, Middle, and Stewart's Islands are the names now invariably given to them by the settlers, and those by which they are familiar toseamen. The South Island was named in honour of the sealer who, in 1808, discovered its insularity. Sentimental settlers designate New Zealand the Britain of the southern hemisphere, on the same principle that the Dutchman Tasman, who discovered the country, called it New Zealand.

Quote:  `The name Aotearoa was made popular around 1898 with the publication of William Pember Reeves' book  The Long White Cloud - Aotearoa,' historian ... Sir Keith Sinclair says.  After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand.  Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper.  Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s.  Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand by using `te motu nei' (in this island).  Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `land of the long twilight'.  The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand.
