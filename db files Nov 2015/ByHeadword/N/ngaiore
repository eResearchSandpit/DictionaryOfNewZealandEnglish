Quote: The larval smelts [<i>Retropinna</i> sp.] which run upstream at the close of the whitebait season in November are termed Ngaiore on the Whanganui ... <i>Ibid.</i> 56 Maoris at Hiruharama, Whanganui River, showed me stores of larval examples caught in the river and dried in the sun. These were salted and eaten during winter months, being there universally termed `ngaiore'.
