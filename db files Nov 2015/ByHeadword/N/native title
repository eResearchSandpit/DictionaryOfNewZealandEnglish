Notes: NATIVE [MAORI] (CUSTOMARY) TITLE. A fascinating and still proceeding investigation. The phrase is not defined in the acts - Native is but not Native Title. There are at least two types of Native (Maori) title - customary, which I presume means communal (of the iwi), and freehold.  There will undoubtedly be more colloquial references in second readings to bills.  The earliest reference is quoted from "1847 NZPCC 387 n at 390" which I will need to consult with a lawyer about - the book in question doesn't have an explanation of NZPCC. (HWO note from 1990s)

Quote: The practice of extinguishing Nativetitles by fair purchases is certainlymore than two centuries old... It is nowpart of the law of the land, and althoughthe Courts of the United States, in suitsbetween their own subjects, will notallow a grant to be impeached underpretext that the Native title has notbeen extinguished, yet they wouldcertainly not hesitate to do so in a suitof one of the Native Indians... Insolemnly guaranteeing the Native title,and in securing what is called theQueen's pre-emptive right, the Treaty ofWaitangi, confirmed by the Charter of theColony, does not assert either indoctrine, or in practice, any thing newand unsettled... The right which residesin the Crown is.. the exclusive right ofextinguishing the Native title.
Notes: 1847 in 1938. It is likely that there are earlierreferences in US law to this concept butfrom the remarks made in the abovejudgment, it seems that these were called"Indian titles", not "Native titles".
