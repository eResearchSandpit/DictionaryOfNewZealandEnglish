Quote: Nelly-birding - Quite often the Peranos would pursue a pair of whales. If the cow was harpooned first, the bull whale would hang around. The whalers, therefore, tried to get a bomb into a bull in a near vital spot. But sometimes the chaser got out of position, and one of the other chasers would fire their harpoon into it. This was called `Nelly-birding'.
