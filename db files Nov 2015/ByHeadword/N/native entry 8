Notes: Native n and aj. remained in official use until 1947. (Cf R. Mason's note, 1953.) The term `Native' in `Native Minister', `Native Department' etc. was dropped during the war in favour of `Maori'. I understand in deference to opinion of B.B.C. who found native `a term much disliked in India etc. & wished to avoid it in broadcasts. Native schools now Maori schools')

Quote: Native, n. This word, originally applied, as elsewhere, to the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, is now used exclusively to designate white people born in Australia. The members of the `Australian Natives' Association' (A.N.A.), founded April 27, 1871, pride themselves on being Australian-born and not immigrants. Mr. Rudyard Kipling, in the `Times' of Nov. 1895, Published a poem called `The Native-Born,' sc. born in the British Empire, but outside Great Britain. As applied to Plants, Animals, Names, etc., the word Nativebears its original sense, as in `Native Cabbage,' `Native Bear,' `Native name for,' etc., though in the last case it is now considered more correct to say in Australia `aboriginal name for,' and in New Zealand `Maori name for.'
