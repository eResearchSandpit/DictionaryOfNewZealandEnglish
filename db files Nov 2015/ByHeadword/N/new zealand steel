Quote: (Within the last few weeks the entire cutlery world has been startled from the quiet tenor of its way by the announcement of a new member of the iron family from the antipodes, who is so finely bred, and so capable of high polish and perfect finish, that it bids fair to become the aristocracy of the whole order.) ... The Messrs. Moseley mentioned in the statement are neighbours of ours and old friends of the Rev. G. B. Macdonald. We have seen some of the articles manufactured by them of this New Zealand steel, and certainly they seem superior to any thing we have ever seen. White & Co., 36, King-street, Convent Garden, London.
