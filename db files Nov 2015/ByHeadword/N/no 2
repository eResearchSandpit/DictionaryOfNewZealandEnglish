Quote: [quoting Thatcher]  Take this glass of nice P.B.,/ Which I now hold in my hand,/ 'Tis of the brand of Hennissy [sic],/ Taste this most superior brand,/ ... Pale brandy or P.B. was the favourite spirit [in Dunedin, 1860s], and a sparkling moselle, which was dubbed champagne, was popularunder the name of No. 2. There was even a bar on board the harbour steamer ... and I have heard No. 2 called for there on the way to Port Chalmers. ... I was told that owing to the large sales of No. 2 the producers sent a consignment of No. 1, which was the better liquor, but no one would buy it.
