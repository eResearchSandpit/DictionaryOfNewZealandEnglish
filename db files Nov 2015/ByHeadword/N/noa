Quote: Noa - the narrowest sense of this word is `freeing from restriction' or `cleansing', but like itscomplementary quality `tapu' (q.v.) it pervades all aspects of Maori life and custom. Generally it is associated with cooked food, water, women, the low-born, and the young, good, and ordinary life events. (see `tapu') Only women or special males have the power to remove `tapu'.
