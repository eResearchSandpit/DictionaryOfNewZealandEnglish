Quote: The neighbourhood may be about to make a comeback in the 21st century as one of the most successful community organisations of the 1980s - Neighbourhood Watch - is being reinvented... Neighbourhood Watch was first set up in 1983 after film and television produced Robin Scholes was viciously beaten in her Auckland home.
