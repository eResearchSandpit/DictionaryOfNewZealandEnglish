Quote: A slowly moving rake of waggons had caught a luggage `noddie' ... and the noddie in turn had caught the deceased ... I instructed him to take off the centre rake of railway wagons first, and then pull off one passenger luggage barrow or `noddie' by hand. A tractor was not needed or necessary. ... I then discovered a smashed luggage noddie on the port side of the linkspan [of the Cook Strait rail-ferry] and could see feet protruding from beneath it.
