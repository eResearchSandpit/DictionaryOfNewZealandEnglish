Quote: In short, there is scarcely any thing which we can imagine, but they have an expression for it, except it be some such words as express the Christian graces of hope, gratitude, charity, &c.; which words, and some few similar ones, always require to be New-Zealandized, and of course to be explained, as to the meaning that is to be attached to them; which is however, in no instance, a difficult task.
