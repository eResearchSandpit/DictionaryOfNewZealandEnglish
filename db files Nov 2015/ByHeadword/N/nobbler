Quote: Nobbler, n. a glass of spirits; lit. that which nobbles or gets hold of  you. Nobble is the frequentative form of nab. No doubt there is an allusion to the bad spirits frequently sold at bush public-houses, but if a teetotaler had invented the word he could not have invented one involving stronger condemnation.[1852]
