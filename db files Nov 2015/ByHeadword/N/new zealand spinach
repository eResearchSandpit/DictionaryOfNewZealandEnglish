Quote: (New Zealand spinach is found on coastal sands, dunes and stony beaches; it does not have a red, fleshy fruit, but a dry seed capsule)... While beach spinach is native only to this country, New Zealand spinach is , in spite of its name, native also to Tasmania, Australia, the Pacific Islands, Japan and southern South America, having been used as a vegetable in south Brazil, Mauritius, Tongatapu and Kanaky (New Caledonia). It is eaten also as a vegetable side dish in Indonesia (especially on Java), where it is sometimes grown for sale.
