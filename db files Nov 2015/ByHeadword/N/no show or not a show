Pronunciation:
Notes: As exclamation meaning something like Not Likely, or No Chance, or Over my Dead Body, as in: "Are you going to the Smith's Cocktail Party?" "No show!" This is quite different from no-show as used in restaurants - "They're a no-show" meaning they didn't turn up to claim their table reservation.
