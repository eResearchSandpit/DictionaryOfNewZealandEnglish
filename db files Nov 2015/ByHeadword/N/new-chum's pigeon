Quote:  ... the long grey moss which hangs in festoons and beards from some of the trees in the heavy bush [especially in mountain country in the North Island]. One kind of the moss ... is almost white and very conspicuous in the gloom of the bush. The settlers' name for it in my part of the country is `new-chum's pigeon'. It is so called because of the imagined resemblance of the mossy bunches to the white breast of the wild pigeon; ... I'm hanged if it would deceive any New Zealander country-born or bush-bred.
