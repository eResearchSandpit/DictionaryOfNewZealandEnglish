Quote: The New Zealand Institute and the Wellington Philosophical Institute started in 1868 with a great splash. <i>Ibid.</i> 670 I think that if we could get the N.Z. Institute to be peripatetic and meet annually at the different towns, we should have a much greater hold upon it... Remember, too, that all these causes of rupture are temporary: the Institute stands, the members go! <i>Ibid</i> 671 I have not seen Hector's remarks on the report of the Institute.
