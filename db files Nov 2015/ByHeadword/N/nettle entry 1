Quote: The native fuchsia  [fn <i>Fuchsia excorticata</i>.] - an exile from South America - and the fierce bush-nettle  [fn <i>Urtica ferox</i>.] are conspicuous amongst the undergrowth, together with the bush-lily  [fn <i>Astelia nervosa</i>.], but we see but few species of the characteristic New Zealand daisy-trees  [fn Species of <i>Olearia</i>.] or of the bushy Veronicas (koromiko), which are so conspicuous in other parts of these islands.
