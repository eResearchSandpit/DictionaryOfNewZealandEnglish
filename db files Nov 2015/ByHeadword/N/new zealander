Quote: Prior to the arrival of European navigators such as Abel Tasman, Captain Cook and De Surville, the indigenous people of New Zealand had no one word for themselves as an ethnic group. Instead, they were known by their tribal names of Tuhoe, Ngapuhi, Ngati Porou, etc. For recording purposes this was too cumbersome, so in their writings the navigators referred to the inhabitants of the country as New Zealanders. The closest concept the people had for such an all-encompassing label was tangata whenua, people of the land. But this did not come into general use until later as it had a more specific meaning in tribal relations between hosts and guests.
