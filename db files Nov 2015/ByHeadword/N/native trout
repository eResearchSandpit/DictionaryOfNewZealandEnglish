Quote: The species of <i>Galaxias</i> may broadly be divided into the small, sea-running whitebait minnows (<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>), the larger native `trout' (<i>G. fasciatus</i> and allied species), which probably breed inland, and an aberrant species of medium size (<i>G. borrowsii</i>) which approaches the Westland mudfish (<i>Neochanna apoda</i>) in form....The larger mottled brown native trout occur in most of the streams and lakes of Canterbury. Their breeding habits are little known from actual observation, but from the lack of evidence of a seaward migration it is inferred that they breed in the streams and lakes.

Quote: MINNOW or WHITEBAIT (INANGA) <i>Austrocobitis attenuatus</i> (Jenyns) ... For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

Quote: There is an old coalpit at Lovells Flat operations in connection with which have been suspended for many years. The pit is chock full of water - in fact it overflows and a lagoon has been formed above and about it. Where the water comes from nobody knows. No stream enters it, and it has no connection with any running water. It must be an accumulation of rain water. Yet it swarms with cockabulli (native trout), and the fresh water crayfish.
