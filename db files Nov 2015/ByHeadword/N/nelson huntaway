Quote: Danger could also be caused by a musterer rolling a large rock to frighten sheep along and save running a dog. [These rocks, started on purpose, were known as `Nelson huntaways' becauseyoung men from that district used to come mustering with young, untrained dogs. When frustrated they would use any method to move a sheep along the beat.

Quote: A lot of young fellows from Nelson used to start off mustering there [at Hillensden Station, Marlborough] and they became known as the Nelson College. If anyone said `I'm going back to the college, you knew where he was going. Nelson men in Marlborough and North Canterbury used to be called Sandy Hookers. Stones being rolled down steep faces to frighten sheep were called Nelson Huntaways.
