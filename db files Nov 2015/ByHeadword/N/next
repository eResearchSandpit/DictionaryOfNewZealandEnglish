Quote: The best-known primer for this kind of activity, and indeed an integral part of the hoon-ethos itself, is the drinking game. Designed to take the monotony out of rapid, heavy drinking, the drinking game perhaps found its purest expression in the version entitiled Next. Down a drink as fast as possible (commonly known as `sculling'), turn to the bloke on your left and say `Next', whereupon he does the same ... very efficient.
