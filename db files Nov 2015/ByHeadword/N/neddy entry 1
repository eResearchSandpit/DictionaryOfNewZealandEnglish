Notes: Jim writes : NSOD and Collins tag <i>neddy</i> as <i>Austral.</i> but it is surely used internationally as an informal synonym of horse - "gee up Neddy". The plural may be distinctive Aus (and NZ) E - I have often heard it in NZ e.g. "he did his money on the neddies." DEH adds: I remember this term in exactly this sense from the 1940s-1950s.
