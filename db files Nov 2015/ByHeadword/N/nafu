Quote:  [`Infanteer' writes] Never was the phrase `She's right' used [in 1940-1944] ... to refer to a job badly done or done with a `couldn't-care-less' attitude. This was never necessary because in the Army we had other phrases to cover such contingencies when things did not go according to plan, such as NAFU and SAFU, the first being a non-adjusting fiasco, the second being a self-adjusting fiasco.
