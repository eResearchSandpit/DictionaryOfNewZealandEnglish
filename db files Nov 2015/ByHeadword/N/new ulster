Quote: Governor Hobson has recently given to the three Islands of New Zealand the names. New Ulster, New Munster and New Leinster; but as no reference is made in recemt communications to these appellations, which are not very euphonious, and are certainly rather perplexing, from the similarily of their terminations, it would appear they are not calculated to please the public taste

Quote: New Zealand is  divided into two provinces, New Ulster, and New Munster, each of which is under a Lieutenant-Governor, who enacts ordinances for the province over which he presides, with the advice of a Legislative Council, composed of the officers of Government, together with a few persons nominated by the crown from amongst the inhabitants. A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster, in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province.
