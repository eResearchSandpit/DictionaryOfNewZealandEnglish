Notes: ca1955 R. Mason notes that `North Islander' is a South Island term (cf MAINLAND (ER)). People in the North Island do not usually look upon themselves as North Islanders, but as, say, Aucklanders or Taranaki-ites, or merely as New Zealanders. In the South Island one is often told:' Oh you're a North Islander are you?' Perhaps this is a reflexion of the parochial or `cinderella' spirit of the South Island which sees itself as being overcome in importance by the more populous and industrial North Island. ?a S.I. usage mainly

Quote: And we are apt to say, when speaking of a person who is away, that he is `off the Island'. If we are told that someone has gone over to the Other Side ... we understand he has gone to Invercargill or to Bluff. Where the North Islander talks of his beach cottage, or bach, we call these little places cribs, a much more euphonious name.
