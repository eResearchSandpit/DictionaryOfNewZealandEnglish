Native
Homonym Number:
Word Class:noun
Sense Number:
Definition:Applied to Maori people and their concerns.  a. The synonym Aborigine(q.v.) was used very early as a term familiar to the Colonial Office (and perhaps to missionary organisations as the Church Missionary Society) and had some currency from the offical name and office `Protector of Aborigines'. See also Cook's  (and early explorer's) indian.  b. native preceded Maori q.v. in common use in early journals and accounts. (eg Markham, Polack etc) the latter being first used (as perhaps native was) as an adjective, and its frequency was (until the 1850's or 1860's) matched only by the use of New Zealand and New Zealander (especially the latter as a noun) for `Maori'. -->[Discuss usage in eg. Markham, Williams, McLean etc.] In Richmond - Atkinson papers Maori seems to be the main personal usage of the correspondents except for H. Atkinson who uses negro, nigger in private correspondence. Abusive early synonyms: see black, nigger, later hori.

[Hodgson, Professor Political Economy, Edinburgh] apparently getting the worst of the argument, came off triumphantly and turned it into a laugh by asking the riddle, `Do you know the difference between a good oyster and a bad one?' - `No!' `Do you give it up?' - `Yes!'  `Well, a good oyster's a Native - and a bad one's a Settler!' - which settled the argument.

Quote: [cp Maori] Many Maoris resent the fact that they are called `natives' by the pakehas. Joking among themselves, they may call each other natives, but the use of the word in this connection becomes a joke just because of the resentment at its use by the pakeha. One informant expressed the matter thus: `We're not natives, we're Maori. A native is an aborigine, a savage, while we are three or more generations away from that. We don't like having a Native Department, or Native schools, or a Native Land Court, or a Native Minister. We like to be called Maori. We're proud of being Maori, not natives.'

Quote: Temple rightly notes Dieffenbach's enlightened perception of the Maori as the first inhabitants with fundamental rights, and not inferior, intellectually and morally, to the invading European. But he labours the point in seeing evidence of this in Dieffenbach's reference to them as `New Zealanders, by implication the true inhabitants of the country, when the terms Maori and Native were become synonymous and implied that they were inferior to the intellectual and moral superiority of white, especially British, races'. At the time, `New Zealanders' was commonly used (eg  The New Zealanders Illustrated by G F Angas, 1847) while the term `native', meaning `native to the place' without the depressed sense it was later to acquire, was also used freely by Dieffenbach.
