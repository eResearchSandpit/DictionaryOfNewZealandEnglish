Quote: The [Prime Minister's] visit [to a Danish immigrant girl in Adelaide] originated a new phrase, `New Enzedder', which Mr Holland said would become the equivalent of `New Australian'. Thegirl said to Mr Holland: `You can't call us new New Zealanders; it's too clumsy. Why not NewEnzedders?' `That is excellent.' said Mr Holland. `we will use it'.
