Quote: A quantity of earth-ballast was placed on the reclaimed land; a few months later the heap was.. covered with a luxuriant growth of weeds.. many" of them unfortunately but too well known in the colony. Others, however, including the notorious Noogoora burr, and the spiny dock or cat's-head, were new.
