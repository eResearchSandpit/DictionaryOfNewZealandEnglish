Quote: The nikau palms which line the river's banks may have been part of a cargo of plants and animals from the Malayo-Pacific region that began arriving in New Zealand when dinosaurs were still chasing each other up and down what is today Queen Street. There were coconuts here then, and probably crocodiles, but that was before the Big Chill. The crocs and coconuts didn't survive the ice ages but nikau palms came through.
