Quote: New Zealand is divided into two provinces, New Ulster, and New Munster, each of which is under a Lieutenant-Governor, who enacts ordinances for the province over which he presides, with the advice of a Legislative Council, composed of the officers of Government, together with a few persons nominated by the crown from amongst the inhabitants. A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster , in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province.
