Quote: Hochstetter divides the steam jets into three kinds:  1. Puias, which are geysers, continuously orintermittently active.  2. Ngawas, which are inactive Puias - emitting steam, but not throwing up columns of water.  3. Waiarikis, which mean any sort of cistern of hot water suitable for bathing.
