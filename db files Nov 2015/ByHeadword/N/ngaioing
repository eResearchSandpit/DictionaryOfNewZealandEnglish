Quote: This part of the season in which the young birds are pulled from the burrows during the daytime is called the ngaioing period. We called it the dirty period! To insert the hand right inside the burrow it is necessary to get right down on to the ground, so within a few moments of commencing work one's clothes were in a filthy condition, especially if there had been rain during the night.
