Quote: I observed that the term `New Zealander' is already employed in this district; only, in lieu of `Noui-Tireni", as the natives of the Bay of Islands pronounce it, they say `Noui-Tirangui' [NuiTirangi] [sic], which gives the word more of an indigenous sound. The word pakeha serves themto signify all whites, whom they also call `Iouropi' (Europeans). I did not observe that they had a special name for the English.
