Notes: 1984 Orsman letter to an enquirer Nugget `boot polish' is a New Zealand and Australian word used, I think, from before the First World War. Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted  Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.
