Notes: A real doozy this one, as the Yanks say. Lots of confusion, popular use masquerading as official and confused official use; am working my way through but have to go back to Turnbull where a helpful young lady produced as I was leaving the NZ Almanacks which seem to be the ONLY source of official titles. Will chase them up further. People in Hansard use very loose terminology and there is no official listing of Ministers in Hansard.  The following is my best effort from the Wellington Almanack (and others): 1822-1850 No record. 1851  Commissioner for acquiring the      Cession of Lands from the Natives: - Donald McLean. 1851 Native Secretary H. Tacy Kemp GBP200 per annum [in addition to above]. 1852 Native Secretary [from Estimates]. 1853 Native Secretary Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1855 Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1857 Native Secretary - D. McLean. 1858 AJHR E-No.1/17 Donald McLean, Native Secretary, writes from Native Secretary's Office, 28 June 1858. 1860  Native Secretary's Department. 1861  Minister for Native Affairs - Honourable C.W. Richmond Native Secretary's Office. 1862  Minister for Native Affairs - F.D. Bell (Acting) Native Secretary's Department OR Native Department. 1863 Native Minister - F.D. Bell Native Land Purchase Department - Crown Commissioner .. D.McLean Native Secretary's Department - Native Secretary D. McLean NOTE; This is the first time the big three Ministers are joined by a new portfolio. 1864  Minister for Native Affairs - Honourable William Fox Native Secretary's Department. 1866  Native Minister - Honorable A.H. Russell Native Department - Minister for Native Affairs - Honorable A.H. Russell. 1867  Native Minister - Honorable J.C. Richmond Native Department - Minister for      Native Affairs. 1868 Native Department - Under Secretary W. Rolleston. 1870 Ministry has now become Cabinet Donald McLean, Minister for Colonial Defence and Native Affairs. 1873  Honorable Donald McLean, Native Minister. 1878 Native Minister & Minister of Justice. 1879  Native and Defence Office Native Minister. 1880 Honorable John Boyce, Minister for Native Affairs Native Office. 1885 Native and Defence Minister Native Office. 1888 Minister of Public Works and Native Affairs. I gave up about here. Basically, you can take your pick.
