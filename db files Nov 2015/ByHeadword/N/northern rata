Quote: Northern rata (Metrosideros robusta) does grow naturally in Wellington (in the South Island from Hokitika northwards).  Both are known as the New Zealand Christmas tree... Pohutukawa doesn't grown naturally here; it is a weed in parts of the region; it occupies sites where the northern rata should be; being closely related to the northern rata, pohutukawa has the potential to hybridise; pohutukawa inhibits the growth of other plants; northern rata's bloom is superior to pohutukawa's.
