Quote: Suppose a friend says to me, `You know that drongo who was on the chain with me at the works last summer? Just a little joker he was, remember? A real serious ankle-biter. Hailed from somewhere down the Wire Wrapper. A right useless bastard. Couldn't see the road to the dunny if it had red flags on it. Well, it seems that he's shacked up with some pluty Remmers sheila and she's about to drop her bundle.' ... A non-New Zealander will probably require a translation, ... My friend is communicating to me the information that a slow-witted, incompetent person of diminutive stature, who was reared in the Wairarapa district and worked for a time in the killing gang of an abattoir, is now cohabiting with a wealthy woman from the affluent Auckland suburb of Remuera. This woman is soon to give birth.
