Quote: When she went in Mrs Bailey had a baby in her arms, and Mrs Williams said, `Oh! what a dear little thing.' Mrs. Bailey said, `Yes, it's a poor little `not-wanted.'' <i>Ibid.</i> 328/5/4 Mrs Williams had two children of her own. She could not account for her sudden fancy to this little `not-wanted.' She had never done this before. The coroner expressed the hope that she would not go in for trafficking in `not-wanteds' again.
