Quote: We come to Wedderburn, home of the only original number-five station left in New Zealand. A number five is the smallest of the stations designed in 1870. This one has a sloping roof, a "ladies waiting-room" in one end and a stationmaster's office in the other, and an open area in between, where the segregated men shivered in the cold.
