Quote: Nos barA nos bar is a phenomomen seen especially in Christchurch in the beginning of the 21st century up til halfway thru 2005. They are bars that allow you to purchase nitrous oxide in balloons, and sit on a couch, or around a table outside, and inhale the gas to get high. Similar to places like Cosmic Corner in what they sell, the sit down environment provides a safe place to use a safe drug. Better than doing it on the street.
