Quote: A different kind of abbreviation of the primary name is found in <i>New Zild</i> (also <i>Newzild, Noo Zild</i>), a conventional representation of the broad, maximally elided Kiwi pronunciation, which is traced in <i>DNZE</i>  to the book <i>New Zild and How to Speak It</i> 1966, Arch Acker's answer to <i>Strine</i>, where <i>New Zild</i> is used both for the accent and for the country itself (although <i>DNZE</i> cites it as the name of the country only from the 1990s). Other (less clipped) renderings of the broad New Zild pronunciation recorded in <i>DNZE</i> include <i>New Zillun(d)</i> and <i>Noo Zilland</i> and, more idosyncratically, <i>NyaZilnd, N'yerzillun</i>, and <i>Newzyullind</i>. All such forms normally have either a jocular or a judgmental implication.

Quote: However, I was unaware that the definition of Newzild had changed to "accent of the neurotically thin-skinned who are above criticism"... I will, however, brush up on my politically correct Maori pronunciation - Taipoo, Fangaray, O'armaroow, Fakatarnay; and at least beogin prectising Newzild - Unvucargoow, Heemoowtun, Weelungtun, Kroistcheerch. But what will Hyacinth Bucket think?
