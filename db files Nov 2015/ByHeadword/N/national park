Quote: It may be remarked that National Park is American in origin, dating from 1872, about the time  that Yosemite was set aside for recreational purposes. In England, park, like forest, may have a definite legal meaning when it applies to a tract of land held by royal grant for keeping beasts of the chase. Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms.
