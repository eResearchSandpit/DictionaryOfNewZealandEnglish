Quote: They had had a most enjoyable tea, and he thanked those ladies who had kindly prepared it. They had been favoured with beautiful weather, and by their visit to the Castle they had learned something more about their history. He thanked them again most heartily, and said he wished their two Maori chiefs were present to give them their native song, but they had left the country. But they would endeavour to sing in the Maori tongue `For he's a jolly good fellow.' Led by Mr. Bray, the New Zealanders then sang `For he's a jolly good fellow ' with much effect. They then gave the `New Zealand Whisper' for the ladies, after which `God Save the King' was sung by all present, Mr. Naylor (of St. George's Chapel Choir ) leading. Three cheers were next given for the visitors, finishing with an `English whisper' for the New Zealand ladies. A most enjoyable time then terminated with all joining in `Auld Lang Syne'.
