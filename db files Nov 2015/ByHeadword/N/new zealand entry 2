Definition:As an attributive from the Country's name, it had in very early times, a connotation NATIVE, MAORI (cf NEW ZEALANDER) often with suggestions of roughness, wildness, or barbarism. It was quickly adapted (see 1840 entry) to include the white settlers and the civilised homeland they were preparing, a sense and use which obliterated the earlier.  Many uses (eg New Zealand Company (1839), New Zealand Gazette) were merely defining, and had, of themselves, no racial reference.
