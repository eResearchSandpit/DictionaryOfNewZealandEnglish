Notes: A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks.

Quote: Neenish Tarts.[This recipe uses raspberry jam in the filling and raspberry coloured icing in place of chocolate. The only recognisable constituent is having a circular iced top in two colours - in this case, white and pink.
Notes: So far no further NZ recipe books have turned it up and it looks as though the 60s might be about the earliest printed occurrence, but I haven't given up hope yet. I have now been through the Turnbull's five boxes without luck.
