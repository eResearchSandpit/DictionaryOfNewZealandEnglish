Quote: <i>Metrosideros robusta </i> (The North Island Rata).  A tee, 50 ft.-100 ft. in height. ... North Island and northern  extremity of South Island. ... Maori name <i> Rata</i>. ... [297] This is the North Island rata, but it is also found on the west coast of the South Island ... It is often described as twining round some forest tree, ensheathing it and finally killing it by a close embrace; this account .... misrepresents, ... <i> M. robusta</i>. It does not begin life as a climber, though there are species which do so, e.g., <i> M. scandens</i>; but it very often germinates as an epiphyte high up in the forks of a tree ... As the young plant develops, it sends down roots to the ground. These roots inosculate, and slowly enclose the stem of the supporting tree.
