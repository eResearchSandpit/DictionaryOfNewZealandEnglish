Quote: [Old Identity] was the name applied by the people of Victoria, who flocked hither in thousands on the discovery of gold [in 1862], to those who had been in the province before that time. Those honest folks, the tenour of whose ways had previously been very even, were greatly startled by this immense and sudden influx of population. 16,000 persons landed in three months, andeverything went up to worse than famine prices. It is alleged that one minister actually prayed that the stream of rogues and vagabonds which was flowing into the country might be stayed, but this I believe to have been a base invention of the `new iniquity', as the new-comers were nicknamed.
