Quote: Nikau fronds make an ideal impromptu shelter.. but the palm was important to Maori not just for thatching but also for weaving and as a food source: the young flower stalks and heart ("millionaire's salad") were the parts most commonly eaten. Even so, the first Polynesian arrivals to Aotearoa were no doubt nonplussed that the local palm did not bear edible fruit like the cocnut. Indeed, one explanation for the origin of the name "nikau" is that it means "no nuts."
