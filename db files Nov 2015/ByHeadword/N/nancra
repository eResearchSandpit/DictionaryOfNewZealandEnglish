Quote: It appears, however, that the very existence of these lakes is a mere matter of tradition, as none of the present generation have ever ascended to their shores, through fear of the nancras, or imaginary centipedes, or crocodiles (for it does not appear very clearly which is meant by the term), which inhabit the banks of all these inaccessible lakes, and with which even whole valleys are said to be so infested that it is impossible to get a native to visit them.
