Quote: There is at least one sense, however, in which Cowan can be said to be ahead of his time. He steadfastly clung to the term `New Zealand Wars'. He rejected the more popular but misleadingexpression `Maori Wars', which implied that Maoris alone were responsible for the outbreaks of conflict. From the 1960s historians have explored more neutral and more accurate terms to characterise the period. Some opted for `Land Wars', but this is not entirely satisfactory because issues were involved in addition to that of land. Others suggested `Anglo-Maori Wars' but this too is less than adequate; the English were not the only Europeans involved and. as already noted, Maoris fought on both sides. For this latter reason `Maori-Pakeha Wars' is also unsuitable. ... If they are referred to as the New Zealand Wars they cannot be confused with any others, particularly if earlier actions involving Maoris alone are designated `tribal wars'.
