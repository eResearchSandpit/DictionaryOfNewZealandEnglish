Quote: The employment of staff through an executive leasing agency which takes a cut out of the rate paid, has been done despite the commission itself telling Mr Mallard there are disadvantages in "executive leases"... Executive leasing was forced on the commission after it looked at other options to find highly technically skilled people for the setup phase of the unit.
