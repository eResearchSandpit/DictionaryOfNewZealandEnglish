Quote: Other throwing games which are mentioned today are: Echo which is widely known (Kapuka [19]29, Paerau [19]24, Stirling [19]35, Ngapara [19]29, Takaka [19]44, Mangatainoka). In this game there are two teams on opposite sides of a wall or shed. `A ball was thrown by one member of one side over the playshed to the otherside [sic]. The one catching it ran round theshed and attempted to hit one member of the otherside before a nearbye [sic] fence was reached. If anyone was hit, that person went to the otherside. The side that was largest when the bell rang, won.'
