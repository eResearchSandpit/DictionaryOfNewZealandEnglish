Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The British equivalent is <i>electoral register</i>. For each district there is a <i>main roll</i>, required to be published each year, and one or more <i>supplementary rolls</i>. In addition, a <i>composite roll</i> may be published. There are no corresponding British terms. (TD: in fact ODE gives electoral roll as the UK term '(also electoral register)')
