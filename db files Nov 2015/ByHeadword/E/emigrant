Quote: `Emigrant' and `Colonist' are used by some as simply convertible terms; though the life of every settler compared with itself, the condition of every colony, refute the mistake. Others, who are aware of the great difference that exists between the two, are yet very far from knowing wherein it consists. They sometimes speak of emigrants ... and colonists as two distinct classes, or rather, castes of men. One who flies from his native land driven by want ... who sets his life on a venture because it is worth so little ... these are Emigrants; while farmers, tradesmen, gentlefolks, those who have something, ... all, in short, who can make up a purse full enough to depart respectably, ... all who have prospects however distant; these are Colonists. I remember well on board the Charlotte Jane on the voyage out to New Zealand, certain friends of mine always called the common passengers - `the emigrants'. Evidently they considered themselves in all respects above the condition of `emigrants.' ... emigrant a term of reproach.  [Cholmondeley says: `An emigrant is one who goes out without a scheme: a Colonist is part of a scheme']
