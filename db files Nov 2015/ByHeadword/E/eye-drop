Quote: There was no football. It arrived suddenly in 1885. We played the town boys at cricket, sometimes using solid wooden bats. There were few spring-handed bats about. At lunchtime we frequently played Prisoner's Base. We played marbles, Ring, and Eye-drop with taws, glassies, stonies, and agots.

Quote: In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.
