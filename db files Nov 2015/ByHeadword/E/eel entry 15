Quote: <i>SNAKE EEL Ophisurus serpens</i> ... The snake eel is the longest of the eels found in New Zealand ... However, the body is very elongate and even the largest specimens are usually less than 5cm in diameter. ... Long-line fishermen occasionally find these eels on their hooks and mistake them for sea snakes, hence the common name for this species.
