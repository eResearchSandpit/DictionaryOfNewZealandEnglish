Quote: [Hdg] Encroachment review finalised. Wellington City Council is about to adopt a revised Road Encroachment Policy... Around the Capital about 4500 encroachment licences are held by Wellingtonians. Licences allow residents private use of otherwise "public" land. Most licences are for garages and carports... Some encroachments also help residents access properties that would otherwise be difficult to reach.
