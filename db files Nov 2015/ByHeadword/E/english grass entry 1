Quote: The all-engrossing topics [in Canterbury] seemed to be sheep, horses, dogs, cattle, English grasses, paddocks, bush and so forth. I was rather startled to hear one gentleman ask another whether he meant to wash this year, and receive the answer `No.' I soon discovered that a person's sheep are himself. He does not wash his sheep before shearing, but he washes; and, most marvellous of all, it is not his sheep which lamb, but he `lambs down' himself. <i> Ibid.</i> iv 43 Another mode of investment highly spoken of is that of buying land and laying it down in English grass, thus making a permanent estate of it.

Quote: Many an aspersion is cast at a danthonia knoll waving white with rank growth, and the grass is condemned as being unpalatable, whereas the person casting the aspersion is probably standing on the very same grass eaten down so well that it is to him `English grass'.  ... the better English grasses are seldom seen to much advantage when growing within a danthonia or a browntop sward. I consider the stunted, ill-natured herbage of the better English grasses is less palatablethan the young, fresh herbage of the second rate species. <i>Ibid.</i>166 The early settlers of a  century ago introduced to New Zealand various `English' grasses and clovers to supplement and later to replace the native grasses on the average-to-superior soil types.
