Word Class:exclamation
Sense Number:2
Definition:In NZ the general English interjectional interrogative particle often inviting assent (OED2 2. `Wasn't it lucky, eh?'), and possibly the interrogative use as a request for the repetition or explanation of something that has just been said (OED2 3 colloq. or vulgar `Eh? What's that, Sackville?), possibly reinforced in some areas by a use of the Maori interrogative n&emacr. produces a typical and frequent form: positive statement +  particle eh? or eh! You're going to town, eh(?)  J. Devanny Old Savage 1927 uses both the general English (negative) and the NZ (positive) use as part of her style (check pages 104 `aye'). Cf 1943 Bennett English in NZ 91 In the mild imperative with  eh - as in `Give us a packet of cigarettes, eh' - it is tempting to see a reflexion of that egalitarianism that frequently strikes the visitor (who misses the respectful`sir').

Quote: By and large ... there is remarkably little difference in English here and in Britain. That is ... after making due allowance for such atrocities as `joker', `it's a fair cow', the ubiquitous `Eh'at the end of every other sentence, and the normal vowel flattening.
