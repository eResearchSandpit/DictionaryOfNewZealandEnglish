Quote: We do not know whether an affable New Zealander about to agree to something is going to say extra good or good as gold or simply all right or even O.K.  [177] Recent popular expressions are good as gold or extra good, both meaning simply `good'. Good as gold is an affable way of saying `Right you are'.
