Quote: As I walked from the yard into the day room [at Lake Alice Mental Hospital] for the first time a young guy said to another: `Have you got eye trouble?' `Yeah,' he said. `I'll fix it for you,' said the young guy - and smashed the other patient in the eyes with his fists. `Eye trouble' is a common expression in Lake Alice and prisons. It `afflicts' those who stare at others and it results in eyes being punched.
