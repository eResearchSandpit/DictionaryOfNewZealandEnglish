The Saddle back, is a brown bird with a bright red spot on its back like a saddle, these two last species, are about the size of a thrush. There are green parroquets, large hawks, and several kinds of wild ducks, besides Emus, greenbirds and woodhens, which are birds of excellent flavour.

Quote: The kivi, called by the sealers the emu, is met with in great abundance on the west side. It is a common article of food with them, being caught with the assistance of dogs. It seems likely that there are two species of kivi, one much larger than the other.

Quote: [The editorial comment is wrong, it would seem, in giving the choice] Mr Bates also informs me, that a bird, called by the `old hands' the `Emu' (Apteryx), exists in the woods. It is about 18 inches high, and resembles the Australian bird of that name, [This may be a reference to either the small Forest-dwelling moa, Megal-apteryx didinus, or the large type of Kiwi (roa).]

Quote: Near the mouth of the Middle Fiord [of Te Anau], they picked up a stone tomahawk and shot a `native emu'. The bird is described as being `curious among the feathered tribe, having neitherwings nor tail'. Caples goes on to say that `Other night-loving birds, such as the keewee and green-bird promenaded around our camp all night.' ... [104] However I favour the conclusion that their `native emu' was the large type of kiwi (roa).
