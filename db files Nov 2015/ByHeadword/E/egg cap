Quote: Nevertheless, [pitching games] had their place [in the play of new Zealand children], and most important of all was undoubtedly  Egg Cap (K-21), known also as Egg in Cap, Egg in the Nest, Egg Cup, Rotten Egg, and Mingle the Bonnets. It was a pitching, chasing, and ball-tagging game in which a ball was pitched into school caps or holes in the ground. Fortunately the game is still played at Alexandra, Central Otago, and has been recorded in some detail. [Holes or `nests' are 6 inches apart.] ... (Naseby, Otago, 1900; Nelson, 1875; Dunedin, 1885)
