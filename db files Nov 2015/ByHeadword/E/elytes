Quote: The uniform which covered all the scholars [in the school of manliness, independence, etc.] alike - `cook's son and duke's son' - as the poet sang in later years - was the blue shirt and the moleskin. The `Elytes,' as they were then [c1860s] called, went to work at first gingerly, travelling in state with pack horses and much mystery, and so much circumspection that they were repeatedly taken for brigands.
