Quote: [We] undertook to risk the reptile [sc. taniwha] if the Maoris would make us two `eel-bobs.' These are made by stringing worms on flax-fibre, which is attached in a loose lump by a cord to the end of a stick. <i>Ibid.</i> 44 The Maoris had our `bobs' ready, ... Presently an old chap named Paitai got very excited because a large eel was `stripping his bob.' The fibre was not strong enough to lift the large eel out of the water.
