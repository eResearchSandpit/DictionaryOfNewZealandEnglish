Quote: The principal place where southern elephant seals, or sea elephants, have been slaughtered in large numbers near New Zealand has been Macquarie Island. The name `sea elephant' comes from the inflatable, trunk-like proboscis which is very conspicuous in bulls. Early sealers simply called them `elephants'.
