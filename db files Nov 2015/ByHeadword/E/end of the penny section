Quote: It costs a bit to say the wedding piece before the registrar and the purse of the apprentice failed to stay the distance. That was the end of the penny section, but the two were not dismayed. Not they. Then began a little game of make-believe. They decided that they were supposed to be married and they pulled the wool over the eyes of Mrs. Grundy - not to mention Mrs. Mardon herself.
