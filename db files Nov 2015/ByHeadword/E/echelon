Quote: From an article First Echelon Reunion by Arthur Helm. The use of the word `echelon' in the sense of First, Second or Third Echelon has puzzled many people, for though it is a military term it does not normally denote a `contingent.' Echelon refers to the position of an army in the form of steps or parallel lines ... A new name was sought for Second World War soldiers, and `echelon' was the word chosen. It was first used in this context on August 29, 1939 ... While in the Middle East - in September 1940 - an attempt was made to alter it to `contingent,' but thiswas not successful, and `echelon' it remained.
