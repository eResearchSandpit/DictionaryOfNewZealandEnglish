Quote: Certainly, the government abolished the generating monopoly held by the Electricity Corporation (ECNZ). But, with the artificial creation of a "competitor".. the state-owned monopoly has become a state-owned duopoly.

Quote: Driven by the quest for market purity, successive governments of both stripes have one by one got rid of electricity forecasting, electricity planning, the Electricity Department, the Electricity Corporation (ECNZ) and - although we still have a Minister of Energy - the Energy Ministry itself... The ministryless Hodgson - who rather wistfully trefers to the "dear old days of ECNZ when there was integrated thinking" but quickly adds that "a ministry per se doesn't give you integrated thinking" - gets his advice instead from a department of the Ministry of Economic Development, an all-purpose bureaucratic pet-minder that services everyone from Jim Anderson to his dog.
