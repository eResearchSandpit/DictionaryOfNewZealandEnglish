Quote: I am only riding my hobby again, which is not the slightest use, for, as the saying is here, I shall have to `eat my Tutu', and be very glad if it does not poison me, for to utter a protest is to beat the air.

Quote: [The newly-arrived settlers] passed with unprecedented rapidity through the crisis of unreasonableness, false pride and grumbling, which old settlers call `eating their tutu'. [fn] `Toot' as it generally pronounced, the leaves of which may be eaten safely by cattle gradually accustomed to its use, is often fatal to newly-landed animals ... It was a very expressive saying, but had died out before my time. [1951 `before the turn of the century'] At least, I never heard it used.
