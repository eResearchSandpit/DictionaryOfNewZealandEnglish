Quote: Sir, - `The Gosling' ... warbles a satirical ditty on the Dinkums. (Applause.) Now listen. As an `Extra Unit' we hit Trentham like any mudlarks in the early winter of 1915. We were dubbed, inter alia:- The Trentham Battalion, Trentham Regiment, `Trents,' Lord Liverpool's Own, Earl of Liverpool's Own, England's Last 'ope, Fulton's Blind Half Hundred, The Portuguese Army, Rifle Regiment, N.Z. Rifle Brigade, The Dinkums, and The Dinks. Amateur army evolution? Sure!
