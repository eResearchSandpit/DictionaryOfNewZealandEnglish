Quote: [R]owing manager and fund-raiser Dudley Storey is planning another `Entebbe (hit and run) operation' and expects his charges to live outside of the village at next August's Los Angeles Olympics. `We'll continue with the Entebbe style of operation of flying in, doing the job and flying out again,' said Aucklander Storey ... `It suits us.
