Quote: Every New Zealand kid is supposed to have an End of the Golden Weather summer - a sun-soaked beach on which to idle away the days, learning about life and growing up. My reality was different. My reality was Karitane... There was a beach, but it was not a golden weather beach... While others have fond childhood memories of the golden weather, mine are more like the leaden overcast.

Quote: Interviewer: I believe the title was even quoted in Parliament a couple of years ago. Referring to our economic situation.. a Labour member noted that "Yes, Mr Speaker; this is the end of the golden weather, but <i>not</i> by Bruce Mason."Author: Flattering, but the title is the one thing in the piece which isn't original. It's from Thomas Wolfe, the American author of <i>The Web and the Rock</i> and <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>, which I had devoured when young.

Quote: The title of <i>The End of the Golden Weather</i> came from Thomas Wolfe's novel, <i>The Web and the Rock</i>, and its content is a gentle exploration of the secretive pleasures and pains of a twelve-year-old boy approaching puberty. <i>Ibid.</i> 39 Although the golden weather of boyhood is marred and effectively ended by the riots, its concomitants linger on into 'Christmas at Te Parenga', the season of ritual indulgence for children.

Quote: The end of the golden weather - the phrase is endearingly familiar. Freighted with nostalgia, it evokes the days of seemingly endless childhood summers before the cares of adolescence and adulthood arose. Originally the title of a solo stage play, it has passed into our language, lodged there by the man who wrote the play and performed it all over the country for the best part of two decades - the great writer and actor Bruce Mason.
