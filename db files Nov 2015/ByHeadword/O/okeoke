Quote: SPINED DOGFISH (KOINGA OR OKEOKE) <i>Koinga lebruni</i> (Vailliant) ...Spined Dogfish is so named from the single spine in front of each dorsal fin, and Dogfish probably because of its supposed carnivorous habits. There are several species of small sharks that are known as  Dogfish. [<i>ibid.</i> 82]. The Maori name for Spined Dogfish is Koinga or Okeoke, and the fish is used by them as food, usually being hung outside and dried, when it will keep for long periods.
