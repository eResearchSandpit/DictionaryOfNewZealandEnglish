Quote: Oxidised country: This referred to country rock in which the iron minerals had been oxidised byexposure to the air above the permanent water-level giving it a brown instead of a bluish colour. The brown could be due to the oxidation of pyrite to limonite and haematite in the rock. Near the water-level there was sometimes a zone of semi-sulphides where the ore might be enriched by leaching downward of some of the values.
