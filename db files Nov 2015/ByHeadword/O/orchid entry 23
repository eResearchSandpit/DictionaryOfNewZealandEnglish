Quote: Potato orchid <i>Gastrodia cunninghami</i> Huperi... The thick, starchy, tuberous roots formed a part of the winter food supply of the maori, especially of Tuhoe of the Urewera district. When being sought by the Tuhoe the tubers would be called maukuku, not huperei; if the wrong name was mentioned during the search, the roots were said to hide themselves.
