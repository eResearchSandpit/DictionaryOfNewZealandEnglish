Quote: Dunedin press baron Julian Smith,.. the publisher of the south's fiercely independent <i>Otago Daily Times</i>, glowers, despite having agreed earlier to the interview... Together they form the fifth generation of a Dunedin publishing dynasty that goes back to their great-great-grandfather, George Bell, who worked for the <i>ODT</i>, New Zealand's oldest metropolitan daily paper, and bought the <i>Evening Star</i> in 1869.
