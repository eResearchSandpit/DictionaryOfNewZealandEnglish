Quote: HOHERIA POPULNEA (<i>A.Cunn.</i>) ... The `HOUI' or `WHAU-WHI'.- ... grows abundantly in both Islands. ... Owing to the chaste [snow-white] appearance of its flowers, it has not inaptly been termed by some the `New Zealand orange Blossom'. The inner bark is peculiar, and consists of layer upon layer of laced fibre, ...From this peculiarity it is called by the settlers the `Thousand Jacket', `lace-bark', or `Ribbon-wood'.
