Quote: In November 1975 [the Japanese research vessel <i>Shinkai Maru</i>] was trawling on the Chatham Rise when she brought up a full bag of brightly orange-coloured fish. MAF scientist Gavin James and his Japanese counterpart Tadashi Inada had never seen the fish before, nor could they find it in their identification guides. After a careful inspection they decided it looked a bit like an inshore fish of the roughy family. It was orange, so they recorded it as 'orange roughy'.

Quote: ...from the outset, there's been one fish Martin has been at great pains to avoid. He describes it as a very pretty white fillet off a really ugly fish, to which I might add it is hugely expensive and utterly without flavour; it's that erstwhile glamour fish of the 1980s, orange roughy.
