Quote: Mr Cargill in the Council, / Made such a funny speech; - / He got up and he stated / That it devolved on each / Of all the early dwellers / To preserve safe as could be, / Amid the Victorian influx, / The Old Identity. / Still cherish barbarism - stick to your Dunedin mud, / Andwith your eight-years' leases chouse [? clense] the Victorian blood /. Still dress your ancient Postman in the style we daily see-/ His costume is essential to the Old Identity. / [The refrain the Old Identity is repeated at the end of every stanza].

Quote:  [Old Identity] was the name applied by the people of Victoria, who flocked hither in thousands on the discovery of gold, to those who had been in the province before that time. Those honest folks, the tenour of whose ways had previously been very even, were greatly started by this immense and sudden influx of population. 16,000 persons landed in three months, and everythig went up to worse than famine prices. It is alleged that one minister actually prayed that the stream of rogues and vagabonds which was flowing into the country might be stayed, but this I believe to have been a base invention of the `new iniquity', as the new-comer were nicknamed.  The term `old identities' took its origin from an expression in a speech made by one of the members of the  Provincial Council, Mr. E.B. Cargill, who, in speaking of the new arrivals, said that the early settlers should endeavour to preserve their old identity. The strangers, who were inclined to laugh at the aboriginals as a set of old stagers, caught up the phrase, and dubbed them `old identities'. Acomic singer helped to perpetuate the name by writing a song the refrain of which was something in this style -  `Touch not that shaky jetty, / Let that old post-office be, / That's one way to preserve / Your old identity'.  So that anything effete came to be styled a regular `old identity'. So much did the name come to be a term of reproach among the Australian diggers that the barracouta 'thyrsites atum), a rather coarse fish, very abundant at certain seasons, and which was consequently very cheap, and a great favourite with boarding-house keepers, was christened by them `the old identity'

Quote: The origin of the descriptive term `Old Identities' has been involved in some doubt. Not only is it a convenient one, but it is now widely used throughout the Colonies to [202] denote the oldest inhabitants, as distinguished from the newcomers, or `new iniquities.' Mr. Charles R. Thatcher, who was the son of a natural history collector at Brighton, and was about his father's business, came to Dunedin with the great rush in February, 1862, and gave vocal entertainments which were highly relished. He was a clever improviser, and nightly sang in rough verse to delighted audiences the events of the day, which then, though trivial, were numerous enough. Mr. E. B. Cargill was seeking a seat in the Council, and addressing the electors, regretted that the old settlers were being thrown into the shade, and that to prevent this they must make a strong and united effort. This was food for Thatcher, who thereupon brought down the house with a witty song of eight verses, each of which terminated with the refrain of `The Old Identity.' Thus:- `Does he wish each brother Scotchman/ To come out in a kilt - / To kittle up the chanter,/ And go in for a lilt?/ With bare legs in Otago/ How very cold 'twould be!/ But it's one way of preserving/ The Old Identity.' Yes, it did seem as though the `new iniquity' were, like a flowing tide, to obliterate the `old identity.' But no such catastrophe happened.
