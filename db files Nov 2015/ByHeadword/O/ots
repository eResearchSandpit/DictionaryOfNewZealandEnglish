Quote: Instead of focusing only upon the workings of the Crown Forestry Rental Trust (mistakenly seen as a Maori agency), it would also investigate those of the Office of Treaty Settlements (OTS), the Crown agency charged with managing the settlements process. The absence of OTS from the <i>Assignment</i> programme was glaringly obvious.
