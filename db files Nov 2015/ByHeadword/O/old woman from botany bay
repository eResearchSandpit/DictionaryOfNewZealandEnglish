Quote: The Dialogue game of Caricature includes The Old Lady from Botany bay. In this game the children must not laugh at the old lady although she does her best to provoke them to do so. It has been known as Diggley Bones (Auckland [19]00), An Old Man from B.B. (Palmerston [19]10), An Old Lady from Poverty bay (Wellington [19]00). It is widely reported in the last twenty years. The Old Lady comes up to the children and says `Here comes the Old Lady from Botany Bay, and what [433]have you got to give her today. You must neither laugh nor smile but say ----'. Then the child would say something funny but try not to laugh when doing so. ... (Nelson [19]49).
