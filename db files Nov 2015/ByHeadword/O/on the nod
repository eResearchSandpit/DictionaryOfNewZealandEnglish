Quote: It is hard to control a cigarette when you are `on the nod'. ... When a person injects heroin, the body responses shut down.Heroin is an anaesthetic. When a person is `on the nod' which does not necessarily follow from a shot, they appear asleep, but are still conscious of what is going on around them.... And the effects of homebake are about the same as for other narcotics - an initial rush of euphoria, followed by more long-lasting euphoric feelings of contentment and detachment (called `being on the nod').
