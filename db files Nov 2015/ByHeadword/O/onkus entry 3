onkus
Homonym Number:
Word Class:noun
Sense Number:4
Definition:I have heard (before 1939?) the expression be on one's onkus = `be on the bones of one's arse, broke'; or `be one's last legs' I had always thought of the word as  `honkers', probably arbitrarily seeing in it `hunkers' or  `haunches', euphemism for `arse', as the concrete expressions were `get up off your onkus', `get up off you behind (and start working etc',) ... `sitting around on your onkus'. [....:.]. However, this meaning is not otherwise known.
