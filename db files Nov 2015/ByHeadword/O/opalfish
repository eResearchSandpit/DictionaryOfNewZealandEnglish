Quote: OPAL-FISH <i>Hemerocoetes monopterygius</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... Both anglers and commercial fishermen of Port Chalmers knew this fish and had bestowed the common name ofOpal-fish prior to my having seen one. The opalescent display of colours left no doubt in my mind as to the appropriateness of the common name. The abovementioned anglers and fishermen had various names to distinguish this fish from Opal-fish - which are as follows: Bluey, Blue-cap, Blue-Bonnet, which I have used.
