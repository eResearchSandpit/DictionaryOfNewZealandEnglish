Quote: (? here rough bush-bashing, undergrowth track; rough country) Here we camped. The lass with the sprained ankle had done a marvellous job. We were all tired, and relieved to be out of the cactus; nevertheless, our only regret about our route was that the weather had prevented some very interesting photography.
