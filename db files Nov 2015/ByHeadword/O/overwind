Quote: Overwind: Failure by the engine-driver to stop his machine before the safety detaching-hook on  the winding-rope came into contact with the detaching ring mounted in the headframe, thus suspending the cage in the skyshaft and allowing the rope to go over the head-sheave pulley. Overwinds had to be reported to the Inspector of Mines. To prevent overwind there were generally two warning bells which rang in the engine-room as the cage was approaching the surface.
