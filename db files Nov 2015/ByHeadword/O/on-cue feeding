Quote: Another term currently hot on the baby jargon scene is "on-cue feeding." Whereas demand feeding ran along the lines of feeding the baby up to 94 times a day (but hey, who's counting?), on cue feeding runs along the lines of feeding the baby up to 94 times a day. but in a much more co-operative cued-on sort of way.
