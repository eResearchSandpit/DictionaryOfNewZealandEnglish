Quote: The runholder was also allowed a pre-emptive right of purchase on his run of eighty acres for his principal station and ten acres for each out-station. This concession ... proved later to interfere with the fuller settlement of the country, as the runholder, in his phrase, `picked the eyes out.'

Quote: To facilitate the working of the station, there were three places where the hands resided. The Homestead, ... the chief one, was at the end of the station nearest civilisation. About eight miles further back was a cottage, known as the `Out-Station' ... [Further back] the Ruahine whare ... This whare was therefore the furthest back habitation ... It was erected for the accommodation of shepherds when mustering the back-blocks.

Quote: Out-station . - A separate establishment where men live and there is usually an overseer, and where part of the station work is carried out. There  were never many o.ss. in Canterbury, though The Levels had two and several other stations one. In Australia (whence, of course, the  word came) they seem to call any hut with yards an os.

Quote: (gloss) Some high country stations are so extensive that it is necessary to have a second homestead situated  at some distant part of the property. Such a place is termed an `out-station'. On Molesworth station they even had a sub-manager at the out-station (Tarndale) in the early days.

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australianusage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally thewriter has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even inadvertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'
