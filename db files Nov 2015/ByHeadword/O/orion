Quote:  In 1873, however, an enterprising English settler by the name of Henry Shacklock produced the prototype of a new coal range, which he later called the Orion. Here at last was an oven designed for New Zealand conditions; its fire box was wide and shallow to draw in the extra air needed for lignite coal, and it did not need to be bricked in. The No. 1 Orion soon outsold all its competitors, ..., and was built substantially the same way until the 1930s.

Quote: ...he was also chief fireman in the run up to Christmas, and that meant keeping up a constant supply of firewood for the black-leaded Orion range that squatted in a corner of the kitchen...[52] The Christmas cake would have been made a couple of weeks earlier, but there were trays of cakes to be baked in the oven of the old Orion stove, as Mum and GRandma and Aunt Liz hustled around and generally got in each other's way.
