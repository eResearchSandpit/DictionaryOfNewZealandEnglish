Quote:  Tilt from a bottle. Bucko said, `Let's move - / There's gonna be an onion up the beach ...'/ His voice like a scratched match, `You wanna watch?'/ `Onion' she knew to be a bikie term/ For when one of the girls took several men/ In frolic - or by force - the onion being/ A vegetable with many layers.
