Quote: Traditionally the shift to once a day is generally used as a signal to the herd that drying off time is not too far off. The expectation is that once a day will initiate a reduction in milk production. However, there is also the obvious positive side to once a day. Once a day will increase cow condition (or decrease condition loss.)

Quote: Mrs Tong said that because the once-a-day approach required a slightly bigger herd, it did take longer to milk ...Our once-a-day cows were at least half a condition score above the twice-a-day cows throughout the year, so they are heavier. [once-a-day]
