Quote: It was our fate to witness the misfortune of the sinking of the Triumph near by, and when next morning the Majestic followed it made us want still more to 'Up and at them'. However, things will not and cannot be always in our favor, but it [is] hard to grin and bear it at times, especially when your side loses without a fair go, or what we call 'an open slather'.

Quote: The petrol was discovered about six miles down the Amyntaion-Servia road and as soon as the lorries were loaded our drivers turned their attention to the ration section of the dump. They were shown where the luxuries were stacked and told to help themselves. It was their first experience of what was to be known later as an 'open slather' and many of them were pink with excitement as they scrambled among the stacks, breaking open cases of tinned fruit, tinned vegetables, pickles, jam, tobacco, cigarettes. You just helped yourself. It was a childhood dream come true and for a quarter of an hour they behaved like greedy small boys. They stuffed their blouses with tins and threw cases on top of the loads of petrol.Often, in the days that lay ahead, we were to be wet and cold, sick and sorry, tired and frightened-never hungry. Empty and half-empty tins of peas and beans and pears and raspberries were to mark the passage of our convoys. It is probably fair to say that from the day of the first 'open slather' until the day we left Greece most of us over-ate.
