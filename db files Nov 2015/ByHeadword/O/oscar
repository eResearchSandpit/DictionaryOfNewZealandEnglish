Quote: [In the early thirties money] was also oscar, and the origin of that, I discovered, was a bit more obscure. Oscar Asche, the name of a famous figure in the theatre world some years ago, rhymed admirably with cash, and the abbreviation to Oscar was a matter of course.  P: money, espec. coin: Aust rh. slang in cash, from OscarAsche, Australian actor (1871-1936); AC 1919; WF n(1) 1949.
