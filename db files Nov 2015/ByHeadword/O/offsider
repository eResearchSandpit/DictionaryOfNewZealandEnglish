Quote: Off-sider.- Assistant. Now mostly applied to the slushy, or cook's mate, but the term may have originated with the old bullock drivers, who drove their teams from the near side. I have oftenhelped the Glentanner bullock driver across the Tasman, by riding on the off side with a whip to keep the bullocks up stream; and he always asked if I would `off-side' for him. I have heard a bullocky speak of his dog as his  o.s.

Quote: Many of the old [c 1880s] station cooks, with an offsider (mate) .. <i>Ibid.</i> 91 Many of the old station cooks, with the assistance of an `offsider' (mate) found no difficulty in cooking for fifty or sixty men. ... it has to be remembered that ... bread cost only 6d. or 7d. a 4lb. loaf, and tea (post and rails) could be bought for 1/- per lb. Some of these contract cooks were great fossickers and managed to find quite a lot of green stuff for vegetables ... <i>Ibid.</i> 127 At Waimate there were about 50 men and boys employed for the shearing - 22 shearers, 1 sheep-oh, 4 fleece-pickers, 4 wool-rollers, 1 brander, 1 wool-classer, 1 classer's boy, 3 pressers, 1 waggoner, 1 cook, 1 cook's mate, generally known as the offsider or `slushy' 8 shepherds; and last, but not least the shed boss, ... [fn] In the early days the manager acted as shed boss. Later, when the agricultural work increased, a special shed boss was engaged.
