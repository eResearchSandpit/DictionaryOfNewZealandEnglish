Quote: Two of the largest, most colourful species of skink - the grand and the Otago - can easily be identified thanks to their bold, almost mesmerising livery.  Shiny black with bold blotches of gold, the Otago skink (<i>Oligosoma otagense</i>) can reach 30 cm in length and is a true giant among the country's endemic skinks.
