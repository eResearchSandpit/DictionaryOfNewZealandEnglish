Notes: Jim writes : Additional illustrations of the NZ use of "out" as a preposition are from the <i>Wairarapa Times-Age</i> 5/5/99 - "out the back of the race" - and "...when the train comes out the [Rimutaka] tunnel..."; <i>Pacific Waves 3/00. And I have recently heard someone in the office of a club say "the card is out the bar."
