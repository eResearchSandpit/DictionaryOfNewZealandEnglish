Quote: I was down there with Old Ashmore's lot, doing the trampoline, and so on; but things was very quizby. Everything went crooked somehow, and the gorger had a hawful cramp in his kick. Well, ramp was the word, and vamose we did, the lot on us; some here, some there. I was reg'lar beached, and I tell you when a cove 'as to spout his smish it's about time to look out. However, I got a job at a livery stable, but although that kep' me in grub, and I slep' in a spare stall, the billet was very multy, and I kep' on the kivvy for something better. [fn] 1. [trampoline] Vaulter. 2. [quizby] Bad. 3. [crooked] Wrong. 4. [cramp in his kick] Emptiness in his pockets. 5. [ramp] Clear out. 6. [vamose] Go. 7. [beached] Hard up. 8. [smish] Shirt. 9. [multy] No good. 10. [kivvy] Look out (qui vive.)
