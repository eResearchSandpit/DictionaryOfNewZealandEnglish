Quote: Many farmers, through overstocking and wrong grazing methods, produce flocks containing a fair proportion of 'overlanders', sheep with matted fleeces. It is almost impossible to shear these sheep close to the skin the first time so a shearer goes 'overland' and then goes back for what wool is left.
