Quote: If they (WCC) have information, they should assess it under the terms of the OIA. Contracting out is not a ground (for witholding information) under the OIA.

Quote: It does not matter that its own legislation advises otherwise; that the Official Information Act aims at openness in the interests of enhancing respect for the law and promoting good government. When the OIA says information should be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it, why, public servants can think of a hundred, a thousand good reasons... Public agencies and ministerial offices routinely put OIA requests on ooze control.
