Quote: The allozyme data revealed the existence of three undescribed taxa, whichwe have labelled: O. "Big Bay", O. " Grey Valley" and O . " Open Bay Islands". O."Open Bay Islands" remains undescribed due to a lack of collected materialfrom this species. The other two species are being formally described in apaper to be submitted to the New Zealand Journal of Zoology.
