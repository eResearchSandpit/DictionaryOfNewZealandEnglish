Quote: There are [sic] a number of native trees in blossom at the same time as pukapuka, including puriri, tea-tree, 'bush-lawyer,' clematis, cabbage-tree, mingi and ohoho. Of these, 'bush-lawyer', cabbage tree and ohoho bloom only at the same time as pukapuka and all three yield more nectar than pukapuka does.
