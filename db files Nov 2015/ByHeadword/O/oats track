Quote: When the harvest is over.. then theMaoris hold their "oats" meeting.. aroundthe grey stubble of the harvestedfield... From the scum of an Englishracecourse they [sc. pakeha jockeys] haverisen to the proud authority of a Maori"oats" track... The entry - a bag of oats- is to be paid before starting.
