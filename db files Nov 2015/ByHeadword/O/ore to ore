Quote: The ore-shoots of all the approximately parallel Hauraki veins occurred in corresponding positions in the veins, and pitched in the same direction as the main shoot. This is the structure termed in the older mining phraseology `ore to ore', or shoots `back to back'.
Notes:  (Fraser and Adams Coromandel)
