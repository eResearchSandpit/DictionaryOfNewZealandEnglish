Quote: [From an article`On the Wallaby' by Helen F. Hunt about wallaby-hunting in Australia being what gum-digging is in NZ] As the hunter was of necessity [?out] a good deal at night, `on the wallaby' came by degrees to mean - according to the natural tendency of language to degenerate, when associated with low ideas - `making a night of it', having a `spree', being drunk; ... But to the rest of us `on the wallaby' means taking off the harness, and letting ourselves run free a bit; putting aside the mask and coming down from the stage; loosening the grip of fashion and returning for a while to the simplicity of life ... We crave to go somewhere `on the wallaby'.
