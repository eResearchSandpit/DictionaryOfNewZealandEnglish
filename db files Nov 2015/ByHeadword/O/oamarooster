Quote: His name it isn't Thomson, / And he is no Masseyite; / But a life-long loyal Liberal, /  Though not much given to "skite." / A well-known Oamarooster / On whom none look askance, / A chap who has been uster / Much dealings with finance; / A one-time Seddon booster / Who made the Tories dance.
