Quote: Big international corporates are now beginning to use the nearly 200-year old term "Oceania" to refer to their Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands operations. The very word "Oceania" makes this seem like a much more attractive part of the world than "Australasia" does; it glistens with moisture, just as a seashell or rock under water is more tantalisingly pretty than when it is dried off and disappointingly dull.
