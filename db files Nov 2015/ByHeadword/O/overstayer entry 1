Quote: The Overstayer tag draws attention immediately. But Kapisi insists, "I'm using it as a word of empowerment, instead of a derogatory term. I grew up with people saying, 'There goes an ovesrstayer.' So I'm flipping it right back at them. We are all overstayers, we all immigrated here [to New Zealand] at some time."
