Notes: Jim writes : Dictionaries define <i>one-way</i> in relation to traffic as allowing travel in one direction only. This does not cover the common NZ one-way bridge, across which a vehicle may travel in either direction unless there is opposing traffic. That is, it can be crossed only one way at a time. Although the distinction is a fine one, it seems real. Possibly the term <i>one-way bridge</i> is itself distinctive NZE. The latest NZ Road Code uses the term <i>one-lane bridge</i>.
