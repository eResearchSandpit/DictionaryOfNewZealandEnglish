Quote: The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five  bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of  Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is Oxford scholar, the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only  two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.
