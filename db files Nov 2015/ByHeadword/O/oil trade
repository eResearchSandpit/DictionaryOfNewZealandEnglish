Quote: The great mainspring of activity at Waikouate, and in these southern parts generally, is Mr. John Jones, of Sydney, who has, for many years, been engaged in the New Zealand oil trade. Most of the fisheries thereabouts are fitted out by him; and he is the principal purchaser and exporter of the oil caught along the coast.
