Quote: Lofty [Blomfield] was just perfecting his own special hold, the Octopus Clamp or, as Hutter used to call it, the Rangitoto special. It was applied by Blomfield scissoring his opponent's legs while on the ground, then by force of his legs bringing the opponent over on to his face, at the same time forcing the opponent's knee up over his own hnee while still retaining the scissors.
