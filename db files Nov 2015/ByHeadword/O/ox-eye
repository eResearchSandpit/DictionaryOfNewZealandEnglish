Quote: OX EYES. Cut rounds of bread, toast to a pale brown, dip in hot milk, butter generously, and place on buttered baking-tin. Separate the yolks and whites of as many eggs as there are rounds of toast. Add a pinch of salt to the whites, whip to a froth, and pile high on each toast-round. Make a hollow in the centre, drop in a yolk, sprinkle with pepper and salt and a morsel of butter, and put in a brisk oven to cook untill [sic] yolks are set.
