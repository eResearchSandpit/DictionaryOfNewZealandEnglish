Quote: Under this arrangement, a landless man, who had enough capital to buy sheep, could graze them on another man's property. Usually, the grazier took one-half of the annual wool clip of the 'terms' sheep and one-third of the total increase at the end of the period. J D Ormond, before his purchase of Wallingford, grazed sheep 'on terms' or 'thirds' on the property of Richard Collins, a Wairarapa sheepfarmer.
