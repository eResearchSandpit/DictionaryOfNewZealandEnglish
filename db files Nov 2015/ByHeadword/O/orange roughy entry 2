Quote: [Hdg] ECONZ's John Clarkson, left, and John Warne of Telecom with an orange roughy... ECONZ builds and maintains the brightly coloured plastic boxes, known as orange roughies, that sit on the back of the boats. They transmit race data, such as speed and position, via satellite technology back to land five times every second.
