Quote: If Boy stops to the right of this line he is said to have 'short-headed.' On the other hand if he goes past the line he has 'overrun his head.' If the sheep is facing right and he continues on to the straight-line position he has also overrun his head. From a distance it is often difficult to be sure if a dog has stopped on the point of balance, or overrun his head or has short-headed.
