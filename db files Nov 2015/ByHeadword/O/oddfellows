Quote: The town was flush with halls: the Miners', the Druids' / and Buffalos, the Order of Oddfellows. Above the stage / in the Buffs hung a wicked pair of horns; all the Druids/ did was play Forty-Fives and Euchre. The Miner's Hall / was there for the weekend pictures, the Women's Institute / Concert, and big hoolies like the Centennial Ball. Oddfellows / to me were just peppermints.
