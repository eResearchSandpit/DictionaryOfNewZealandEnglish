Quote: O.E., as every New Zealander knows, means Overseas Experience. The term refers, as in such colloquial phrases as: `He's gone to get his O.E., eh,'; or `Got your O.E. yet then?' to that most rare of concepts, an abstract consumer durable. It has little in common with the Australian vernacular `O.S.', which is a mere descriptive term, as in `He's gone O.S. and won't come back.'

Quote: O.E. falls into a tangle [heading]  In his new novel O.E. Keith Ovenden returns to the basic elements of 1984's Ratatui ... Despite the bludgeoning conclusiveness of its title O.E. leaves a great deal unsaid about the strange place overseas experience holds in our cultural texture.

Quote: The great OE, the New Zealand rite of passage, tattooed in our psyche, embedded in our genes. Young New Zealanders have been setting off on their OEs for over half a century. <i>Ibid.</i> 33 "OE has become an almost obligatory rite of cultural consumerism... For a middle-class young Pakeha New Zealander, not taking an OE is now unusual."

Quote: We are both suffering from what the richcall a jaded palate, others call"Cultural Imperialism" and what mysophisticated friends call OE depression.OE, of course, is the abbreviation foroverseas experience - and no NewZealander, it is claimed, is completewithout it. As well as being vital toemotional and intellectual (and sexual)development, OE very nicely fills thatawkward gap between high school andmarriage.

Quote: Now the average Kiwi going on his or her OE is older and, arguably, smarter. Far from funding their OE working in a London pub, they're more likely to work in an office... Auckland's Jess Startup, 24, who went overseas in 1998, believes the pub-working OE is a thing of the past for most New Zealanders... For example, going to teach English in Korea or Japan is a lucrative way of having a Big OE.
