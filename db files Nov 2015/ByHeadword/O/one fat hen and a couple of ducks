Quote: Included in Hodges's study is the truly macho battle of alcoholic consumption - the drinking game. ... There'll be some inane feat of manliness to perform, such as a lew tongue-twister, or aphysical show of strength, and he who loses has to down his glass in a gulp. In Otago alone, Hodges found 42 varieties of the theme, with names such as `One Fat Hen and a Couple of Ducks' or the `Hokonui Swindle'
