Quote: The last fortnight saw The <i>Out House</i> say good bye and <i>Kiwi Fruit</i> step into its 11pm, Monday night shoes. ... Also by the time the <i>Out House</i> started to get good it was over. ... [7] <i>Kiwi Fruit</i> is his first on-screen role. ... The gayest thing about <i>Kiwi Fruit</i> is probably the presenters.
