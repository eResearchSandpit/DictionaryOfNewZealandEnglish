Quote: [<i>Coprosma lucida</i>, Forst.] The `Broad-leaf' or `Orange-leaf' tree of the settler; terms, however, which are probably not only applied to other species of the genus <i>Coprosma</i>, (e.g. <i>C. robusta</i>, Raoul,) but to species of genera belonging to very different families - and especially to <i>Griselinia lucida, (N.O. Corneae,)</i> whose foliage closely resembles that of  <i>Coprosma lucida ... C. lucida</i> is also known to the Otago natives as `Kalamou' (Hector); and to the North Island Maoris as `Karamu', [fn] `Kakaramu,' or `Karangu,' [fn] (Colenso.) [fn] Also applied to <i>C. foetidissima.</i>
