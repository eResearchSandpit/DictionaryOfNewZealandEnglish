Quote: "Shit, the oinkers must've broken it up already.' <i>Ibid.</i> 160 In the darkness, what I can make of the oinker's face beneath his peaked hat only goads my alarm. Some oinkers have hearts - seriously - are open to interpreting the law a little eccentrically when it's in the common good. <i>Ibid.</i> 162 I can read this guy's history like a timeline: straight C student;... lost cheery at age nineteen (to a twenty stone boiler);.. first beer and 'parties' at oinker school...... when dealing with obstinate oinkers, the dude tends to get conciliated-out pretty quickly. <i>Ibid.</i> 171 Every set of lights in the rear-view looked like oinkers.
