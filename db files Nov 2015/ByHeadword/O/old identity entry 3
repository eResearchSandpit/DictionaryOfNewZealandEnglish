Quote: To `blow' is, in the colonies, to brag or boast; this is graphic if not elegant; but one of the most curious expressions, based on an entirely errroneous derivation, is `an old identity', used for a person long `identified with a place' - in fact an old inhabitant, or one whose interests have long been bound up in it. This expression is unfortunately now universal even in newspapers.

Quote: Old Identity phrase denoting a person well known in a place. A term invented in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1862, in a popular topical song, by Mr. R. Thatcher, an improvisator. In the song the `Old Identity,' the former resident of Dunedin, was distinguished from the `New Iniquity,' as the people were termed who came from Australia. [1879. W. J. Barry, `Up and Down,' p. 197:]
