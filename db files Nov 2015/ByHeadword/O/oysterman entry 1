Quote: By the time the 1951 award was settled, oystermen received 1s 7d a sack, with a bonus of twopence halfpenny for skippers and a penny halfpenny for engineers.<i>Ibid.</i>210 The Marine Department biologist investigating Foveaux Strait oysters said the potential continuing yield was 170,000-180,000 sacks. Merchants, skippers and the oystermen united to claim that a catch of that size would ruin the beds.
