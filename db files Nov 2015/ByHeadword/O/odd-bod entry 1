Quote: Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking.' The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club-room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club, and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitled to shelter. The same law holds for  bush and mountain: hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists ! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist ! They were treated with the loftiest contempt. I suppose I came under the heading `odd bod' vouched for by a `type'. ...
