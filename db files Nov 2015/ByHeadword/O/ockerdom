Quote: Murray Holden suggests that to acknowledge in even the slightest way our British heritage is to confirm our colonial status (Letters, June 8). This is demonstrably silly. On the other hand, given the number of column inches and amount of TV time devoted to a certain Australian sporting competition, I'd have thought it far more likely we could be justifiably accused of being in thrall to Ockerdom.
