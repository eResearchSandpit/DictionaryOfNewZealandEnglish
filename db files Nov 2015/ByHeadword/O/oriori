Quote: One teaching method used by Maoris traditionally was oriori (lullaby) singing. `An oriori, when sung to children, instils in them a deep purpose in life as well as educating them in genealogical traditions, and respect for their own culture and people,' Mr Reedy said. Orioris were also used to teach children life skills such as growing and gathering food.
