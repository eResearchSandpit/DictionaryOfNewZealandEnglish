Quote:  [`one one's own hook', `for oneself'] `Why, mother, poor old mother,' said Harry, ... `who would have expected to find you here [in New Zealand]? I thought you were still in the Old Country.' [88] ... Annie, who was married just before we left the old country, and Tom, who is working on his own hook now, but not far from here.
