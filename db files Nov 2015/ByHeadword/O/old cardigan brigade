Quote: In the reorganisation that followed[1985] virtually a whole generation ofstate servants between 50 and 60 wascleaned out...Mr Hunn calls that generation the "oldboy in the cardigan brigade", but saysthat though jokes were made at theirexpense, it was that group who were thekeepers of the public service flame.Nothing on a continuing basis hasreplaced the "old cardigan brigade"values, with a written code of practicefor public servants failing to fill thegap.
