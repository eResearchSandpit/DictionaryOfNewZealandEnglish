Quote: First Officer Corbin's first [serv]ice [in the WRNZNS] was in the Philomel, at Auckland, as oneof 25 recruits hurriedly equipped with the ready-made navy overalls known in the Service as `Orphan Annies.' Recalling those first days [in Dec. 1942] she remarked that the girls had a very mixed reception from male members of the Service. `But they soon got used to us.'
Notes: [1942 Dec]
