Quote: They watched any changes in the grading of beef; and the killing sheets of their lamb grades were, and are, a puzzle - 'P', 'PM' 'M' - though they know what an Omega lamb is. I didn't, but I discovered that those lambs under 22lbs (Omegas) are sent, only in cuts, to the market in Greece; but since March 1976, their export as carcases is permitted.
