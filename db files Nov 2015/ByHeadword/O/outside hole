Quote: If gold was found in flat valleys the lead was always supposed to follow their course; whereas in many instances it went right across their course: and while experienced diggers were engaged in sinking prospecting holes and shafts up and down the valley, a new chum, who had never see agoldfield before, would often come and put down what was termed an `outside hole', and strike the lead as rich as ever.
