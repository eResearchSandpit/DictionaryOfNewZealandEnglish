Quote: Calculus is a fine upstanding son of Trenton and Rosemary, with the most pronounced Roman nose I have ever seen an animal display; in fact it forcibly put me in mind of an old man schnapper.

Quote:  Many large Snapper are caught with a peculiar hump on the head which is caused by a thickening of the frontal bone. When a fisherman lands such a fish he immediately states: `I've caught an old man Snapper' under the erroneous impression it is an old male fish. I have often dissected these `old man' Snappers and found that there were as many female as male fish with this conspicuous bony knob. The name `old man Snapper' comes from the likeness to the face of an old man with bulbous red nose, a short clipped moustache and tight upper lip, which can be seen in the illustration.

Quote:  `Old man snapper' are those fish which develop a hump on top of the head as they become older; often the fleshy upper lip also increases in size. This condition may affect females as well as males. The term `old man may also be applied to old, slabby fish in poor condition, whether they have developed a hump or not.
