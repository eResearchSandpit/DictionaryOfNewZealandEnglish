Quote: In a report on discrimination against Pacific Island visitors, Mr Hirsh said the former National Minister of Immigration, Mr Frank Gill, in 1977 linked overstayers with `communicable disease' and talked of an `overstayer epidemic.' Such an equation of overstaying with disease was both revealing and irrational, Mr Hirsh said. `We submit that the racism involved in stereotyping andtargeting Pacific Island groups during the overstayer campaigns of 1974-76 has remained an influence in the department,' he said.
