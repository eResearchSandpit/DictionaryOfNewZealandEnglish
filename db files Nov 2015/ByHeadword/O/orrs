Quote: A student verified as having very high needs on ORRS (ongoing and reviewable resourcing scheme) attracts 0.2 of a teacher, while a student with high needs gets 0.1 of a teacher... It is still awaiting an appeal to the ministry, for ORRS verification for one student, while funding for those who do have ORRS does not cover all the costs.

Quote: A rigid system of identifying who qualifies for funding under the Ongoing Resourcing and Reviewable Scheme (ORRS) which has been based on a fixed and limited budget; schools not having the expertise, inclination and funding to support SN students... The ORRS funding provides a certain number of teacher aide and specialist teacher time each week, depending on the level of verification.
Notes: incorrect expansion of the acronym
