Quote: Pine trees and then iliagnus growing through were the main shelter belts.
Notes: This was in about the 1920s. Aeliagnus hedges are known to me as shelter belts around houses in Taranaki in the early 1930s but they were not popular and I think the people who planted them lived to regret it; they had some thorns but they were very dusty. The spelling obviously varies - I think mine is probably closer to the Botanical name.
