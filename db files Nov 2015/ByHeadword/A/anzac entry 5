Quote: When I took over the command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt a year ago, I was asked to send a telegraphic code address for my Army Corps, and then adopted the word `Anzac.' Later on, when we had effected a landing here, I was asked by General Headquarters to suggest a name for the beach where we had made good our first precarious footing and then asked that this might be recorded as `Anzac Cove' - a name which the bravery of our men has now made historical, while it will remain a geographical landmark for all time.

Quote: A.N.Z.A.C./ WHO SPOKE THE WORD FIRST?[heading] Nobody, except an occasional odd or eccentric person, disputes the fact that the word `Anzac' came from the initial letters of Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. as Mr C.W.Batten explained in No. 1 issue of `Quick March,' but there is an interesting difference ofopinion as to the first use of these initials as a word.Major Waite discusses the matter in a letter to the Editor of `Quick March,' thus: In a Wellington paper I notice that another soldier has claimed to be the originator of `Anzac.' This was an army cook, who, noticing so many stores coming off marked A.N.Z.A.C. said to his mates: `I wonder how many more of these ------ Anzacs are coming ashore here.' His mates took the thing up, and so the word `Anzac' originated. The poor cook is now dead, having been tapped on the head by an army mule. The cook perhaps is lucky to be dead. As a returned soldier he might have been  miserable.  Poor Anzac! This is the fourth story I have seen in print. (1) The late respected, but now deceased cook. (2) A warrant officer in an Australian Signal unit on the Peninsula. (3) In the `Anzac Book,' General Birdwood definitely states that when he took over the command of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt, he was asked to select a telegraphic code address for his Army Corps, and adopted the word `Anzac.' Later on, after the landing, he  was asked by General Headquarters to suggest a name for the beach, and in reply he christened it `Anzac Cove.' (4) General Ian Hamilton states, in his preface to `Crusading at Anzac,' A.D. 1915, by Signaller Ellis Silas: `As the man who first, seeking to save himself trouble omitted the five full stops and brazenly coined the word Anzac, I am glad to write a line or two in preface to sketches which may help to give currency to that token throughout the realms of glory.'  The four distinguished soldiers mentioned above (`Anzacs every one,' as the pantomime song has it) are in measure right. In this way: when the two divisions were made into an Army Corps, the full title was `Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.' In the army short cuts are always taken. (!!!Editor). Civilians are always mystified by `the D.A.D.O.S.' and `the D.A.Q.M.G.' It is easy to imagine the harassed adjutant of divisional artillery, or an overworked brigade-major writing A.N.Z.A.C. when referring to the Army Corps, and so, the first day after the formation of the Army Corps, busy soldiers in a hundred different places wrote the new word with full stops after each letter. Our landing was known as the Gaba Tepe landing. In the London Gazette away in June, 1915,  the neighbourhood `of Gaba Tepe' was often referred to. The A.N.Z.A.C. was doing its best to hold its bit of country, and everything came addressed ANZAC - the General's letters as well as the cases of the above-mentioned chef.  Someone must have been the first to write, and someone else perhaps the first to enunciate the honoured word, but who they were will never be decided. 1952 Duff Shepherd's Calendar (1961) 26 Apr 75 It is not that Anzac no longer means anything to me or should now, I feel, be forgotten. 1958 Whitcombe's Modern Junior Dictionary (8th edn) 18 ANZAC A name used from 1915 for `Australian and New Zealand Army Corps'. 1959 Sinclair History 302 [Colonial-NZ glossary] Anzac Australia and New Zealand Army Corps. (First World War, 1914-18) 1966 Encyclopedia NZ 1/53 Such is the respect with which the term Anzac is held that an Order in Council was promulgated on 31 August 1916 forbidding the use of the word in connection with any trade or business. 1984 			Pugsley Gallipoli 70 fn ANZAC came into being when the clerks on Birdwood's Headquarters had a rubber stamp `ANZAC' for registering correspondence. This was credited to Sgt K.M. Little, a New Zealander serving on Birdwood's headquarters. After being in common use among the clerks for some time Maj C.M. Wagstaff proposed ANZAC as the telegraphic codewood[sic] for the Corps. The i? gradually spread into common use. See Bean,  The Story of ANZAC Vol 1 p. 124-125 also ... Little, Papers.
