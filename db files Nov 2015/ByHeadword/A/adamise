Quote: `Why can't you people leave names alone?' I had asked Falla one day when showing him a fern plant at the Auckland Museum. `Leave them alone and lose our jobs?' he had replied. ...[156fn] `but sooner than see our wives ... begging bread ..., we will trot out every animal and plant inNew Zealand and adamise them afresh. Yes, just as Adam did and just as arbitrarily.'
