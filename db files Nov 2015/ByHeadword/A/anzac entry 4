Pronunciation:
Notes: [Fraser and Gibbons (1925 Soldier and Sailor Words 7) note that `The heroic feats of the Australians and New Zealanders on Gallipoli made Anzac a term of the highest honour, specially associated with the Dardanelles operations. It had eventually to be officially notified that `Anzac' was restricted to men who had fought at Gallipoli; owing to the loose way people in general used the word often for Australians and New Zealanders who had never been there at all.'].
