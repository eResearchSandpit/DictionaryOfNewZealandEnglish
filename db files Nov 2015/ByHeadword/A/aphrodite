Quote: ... a scream was heard from the ladies' bed-room. It appears that one of them had tucked her feet well inside the hem of her `aphrodite', and stretched them well down to the bottom of the bed, and in doing so kicked the crab [put there as a practical joke]. It ... grabbed hold of the hem of the [49] above-mentioned garment.
