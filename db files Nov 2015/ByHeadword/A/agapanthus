Quote: Protecting any one reserve may involve controlling less charismatically nasty plants such as agapanthus (<i>Agapanthus praecox</i>), and on occasion even natives - remember,m a weed is a plant growing in the wrong place. ... Posioning the agapanthus on the Southern Motorway banks is sheer folly.

Quote: The nodding blue heads of the agapanthus define a part of New Zealand history. They have long been part of our experience of the city and the city fringe,atleast since before 1952, when this South African migrant acclimatised - that is became, if not a New Zealander, then a permanent resident ... when the renga renga lilies on the traffic islands have turned brown, the hebes have gone leggy and the cabbage trees have died, the agapanthus soldiers on, softening harsh urban spaces, reliably resplendent in a deep and purple-blue garb.
