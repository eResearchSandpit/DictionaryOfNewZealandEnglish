Quote: Anzac Rolls. One level breakfast cup each of oatine, sugar, dessicated coconut, 3/4 level cup flour, 1 heaped tablespoon golden syrup, 1/4 lb butter, 1 teaspoon soda dissolved in 2 table spoons boiling water.  Melt butter and syrup and add with the boiling water to well mixed dry ingredients. Put small taspoonfuls on cold slide, leaving plenty of room for spreading. Bake in hot oven about 8 minutes. Roll while hot and put aside to get cold. These quantities make quite a lot and they keep well in air-tight tin.
