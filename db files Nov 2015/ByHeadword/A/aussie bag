Quote: ...Australian euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke planned to distribute the "Aussie bags" when he visited New Zealand to hold euthanasia workshops, possibly this year. The controversial bags, made by the Exit Australia group which Dr Nitschke founded, have an elasticised opening and are based on a Canadian design. They are aimed at terminally ill or severely incapacitated people who want to die because thet are in pain or in distress.
