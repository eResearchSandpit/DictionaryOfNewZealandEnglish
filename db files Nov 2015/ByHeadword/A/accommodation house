Quote: On Friday last a man, named William Gibson, who was on his way to Nelson to attend the sitting of the Supreme Court, left Birch Hill, the station of G.W Schroder, Esq., and, by his not having reached the Accomodation House for travellers, on the western side of the Wairau river, on Sunday, it is feared that he must have lost his life, either in attempting to cross that or the Branch river, both of which were flooded at the time.
