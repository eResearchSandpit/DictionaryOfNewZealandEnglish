Quote: Disposal of ag-wrap, or bale wrap, and other plastic waste on the farm is a growing problem .. Mr Miller's invention will not only help get rid of ag-wrap, but supply a simple-to-install, flexible, staple-free lightweight and long-lasting fence batten. But a problem with recycling ag-wrap is it gets grass-stained.
