Quote: [Advt] All of the regular milk we drink in NZ is a mix of A1 and A2 milk (about 70% A1 amd 30%A2), depending on the herds... It is only in the highly developed, intensively bred western herds that this incidence of A1 cows producing A1 protein in the milk has occurred - a genetic mutation following domestication.
