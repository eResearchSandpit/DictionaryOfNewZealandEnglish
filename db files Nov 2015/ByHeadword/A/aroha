Quote: Aroha - `love' is an inadequate translation. Aroha refers to love for one's own family group, but the tendency now is to use it to refer to one's love for all people, i.e, goodwill. It combines the positive qualities of respect, kindness, hospitality, help and the desire to do good for other, without thought or desire for reciprocal action. It is charity of feelings. (I have yet to hear it used  in a sexual sense). Aroha comes from knowing that one's kin shares common ancestors
