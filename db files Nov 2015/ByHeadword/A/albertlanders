Quote: [Hdg] The Albertlanders. The title 'Albertlanders' was given to the Nonconformist colonists who settled at Port Albert from late 1862 to 1863. The formation of the 'Albertland Christian Colonial Movement' was an idea devised by Englishman William Brame as a bi-centenary celebration of the expulsion of the Nonconformists from the Church of England. Approximately 3000 settlers left British shores to join the movement.
