Quote: Describing himself as a half-caste, Judge Jurie said that there were many times he was tempted to publicly reject allegations of Maori bias. ... `But it is saying that Anglos can hear Maori cases and they will never be accused of bias ... It assumes that Anglo are fair but Maori are not and that hurt me a great deal.'
