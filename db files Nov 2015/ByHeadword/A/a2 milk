Quote: Imagine if drinking a glass of milk a day was enough to ward off heart disease in later life. But only a particular kind of milk known as A2. [20]I'm not saying there's nothing in the A2 story... What I am saying, right now it is mischievous to say that A1 is bad for you or conversely to say that A2 is good for you, because the evidence is pretty well non-existent."  ...he fed A1 and A2 milk to mice and found that those on a diet of ordinary milk didn't get diabetes while many of those on a diet or ordinary milk did.
