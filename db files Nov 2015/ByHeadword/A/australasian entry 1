Quote: There is not in New Zealand, as in each of the other Australasian Colonies, one metropolitan centre of population overshadowing, by comparison, the other towns of the colony. The peculiar configuration of the colony made it especially adapted for the establishment of settlements comparatively remote from one another. As a result the colony was formerly divided into nineprovinces, each having its capital town. Of these, the principal are the Cities of Auckland,  Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.
