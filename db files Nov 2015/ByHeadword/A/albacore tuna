Quote: The larger fish [Yellowfin tuna, <i>Neothunus macropterus</i>] with very large second dorsals and anal fins are often called Allison tunas, but it is considered that the two are identical and that the larger [270] finned fish are a growth stage of the Yellowfin. They are known as Yellowfin-albacore in some parts of New Zealand.
