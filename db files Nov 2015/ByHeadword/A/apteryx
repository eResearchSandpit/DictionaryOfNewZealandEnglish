Quote: [Letter from Rev. W. Colenso Waitangi, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, Sept. 4, 1850]: -->.us `You enquire after an -->Apteryx. How delighted should I be to succeed in getting you one. Three years ago Owen expressed a similar wish, and I have repeatedly tried, but failed. Yet here they still are in the mountain forests, though, doubtless, fast hastening towards extinction. I saw one in its wild state two years ago in the dense woods of the interior; I saw it clearly....Two living specimens were lately taken by the Acheron, steamer, to Sydney, where they died; these were obtained at the Bay of Islands, where also I once got three at one time. Since then I have not been able to obtain another, although I have offered a great price for one. The fact is, the younger natives .<i> do not know how to take them, and the elder ones having but few wants, and those fully supplied, do not care to do so. Further, they can only be captured by night, and the dog must be well trained to be of service.' </i>

Quote: Like many of the New Zealand birds the <i>apteryx</i>) is nocturnal in its habits, dwelling beneath extensive beds of fern, where it conceals itself during the day. The largest species, the `fireman' of the whalers, is from the Middle Island, and is considerably larger than the other two.
