Quote: Metrosideros fulgens Sol. ex Gaertn. Maori names: Aka, akatawhiwhi,  puatawhiwhi, aka kura ... Bushmen quench thirst with the juice of the vine which if cut and the bark left hanging, exudes a large quantity of clear juice tasting somewhat like cider. [Laing and B. 1957. Prior to Oliver's paper 1928 TrNZI 59] this well known vine was called M. florida Sm. Oliver identified it as M. scandens (J.R. & G.Forst.) Druce, but Allan treats M. scandens and M. florida as synonyms of M. fulgens.
