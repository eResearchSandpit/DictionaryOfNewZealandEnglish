Quote: I now have to refer to insects, or rather to one that I met with - the great Alpine Weta - whose bite is perhaps more dangerous than that of any other insect found in the forest .. It will be exhibited before the Natural History Society, Wellington, and named 'Deinacrida Broughi.'"

Quote: The scientific name of the insect is <i>P. montanus.</i> It appears to be variously referred to as `Mount Cook Flea', `Jumping Spider' etc., but as the insect is allied to the weta, a more correct name would be <i>Alpine Weta. </i>
