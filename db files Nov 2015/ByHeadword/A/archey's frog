Quote: The tiny New Zealand frogs are, like the tuatara, relics from New Zealand's Gondwanaland past. The four known species - Archey's frog, Hochstetter's frog. Hamilton's frog and the Maud Island frog - lack external ears, don't croak, are nocturnal and hatch directly without going through a tadpole stage.
