Quote: A BOARDING SCHOOL for the Education of Native Children is about to be opened at the Church Mission Station at Otawhao, in the District of the Waikato. .. In order to be enabled to carry out this plan with a prospect of success, the Resident Missionary earnestly requests the assistance of all those persons who feel an interest in the welfare of the much neglected Anglo-Maori Race.
