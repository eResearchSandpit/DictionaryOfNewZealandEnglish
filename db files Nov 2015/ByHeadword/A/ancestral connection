Quote: Dr Cullen says the term "customary title" is confusing and has been widely misunderstood. The Waitangi Tribunal says the term is a "misnomer" when the foreshore and seabed will still be owned by the Crown with Maori rights lessened. It has been replaced by "ancestral connection"... Ancestral connections, where recognised, will bring Maori more ability to participate in decision making.... Ancestral connections: iwi connections to a particular part of the foreshore and seabed may give a guardianship role. Proved connection will give iwi more say in the management of the area.
