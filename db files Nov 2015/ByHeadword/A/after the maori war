Quote: He had a good voice; he liked to sing in public, he liked to dance and attend pic-nics - to put on his `bell topper' and walk out of Church if he disapproved of anything said in the sermon - and he had a passion for inventing highly unpracticable things, like collapsible umbrellas or folding lamps. He had one saying with which he met all difficulties. "Depend upon it, it will all come right after the Maori war.' [fn2 162] Wars between the British forces and the Maoris continued until 1872; long enough, presumably, for an expression like this to become current.
