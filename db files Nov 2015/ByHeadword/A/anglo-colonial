Quote: The Royal Colonial Institute in 1868, the Imperial Federation League in 1884, the British Empire League a decade later, all numbered among their most energetic founders colonials, Canadians and Australians as well  as New Zealanders, living in England. The reaction against the anti-imperialist views of the extreme free traders had been traced to the protests of these `Anglo-colonials against the withdrawal of imperial troops from New Zealand in 1868.
