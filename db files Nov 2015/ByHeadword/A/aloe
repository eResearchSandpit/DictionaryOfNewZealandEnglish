Notes: [What is reference; ?to e.g. nikau: or is Lady M. mistaken in thinking an aloe is a palm and native to NZ; or is she referring to a  century plant (American aloe); or phs to a yucca. John Dawson notes: `towering' suggests nikau, though I can't think why she should call it aloe. ??The century plant could perhaps also be called `towering' when in flower.]
