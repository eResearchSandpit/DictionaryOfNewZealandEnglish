Quote: [The Maori implement's] genuineness has been questioned, one sceptic asserting that is was neither more nor less than a British marlinspike; but the carving was of native pattern, and the pointed portion, instead of being conical as is common in European, was also characteristically Maori in type ... The late Archdeacon Williams had told him it was called an ahao, and he found that another name was purupuru. Only recently, through the assistance of Mr. Percy Smith and the knowledge of some old-time Maoris at New Plymouth, had he found its purpose. It was really a marlinspike used for the caulking of sea-going canoes, and having a like end in view, the Maori had developed an implement almost exactly resembling that of the Europeans.
