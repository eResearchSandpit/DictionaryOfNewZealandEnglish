Quote: Austrian wine had caused loss of life and it should be put down with very drastic measures. I do not know whether the name is a misnomer or not; but it is a liquor that is sold in the district north of Auckland. I have never seen the stuff but I believe it to be one of the vilest concoctionswhich can possibly be imagined. I do not know what its ingredients are, but I have come across people who have seen the effect of the use of Austrian wine as a beverage, and from what I learned it is a degrading, demoralising and sometimes maddening drink to many people who useit.
