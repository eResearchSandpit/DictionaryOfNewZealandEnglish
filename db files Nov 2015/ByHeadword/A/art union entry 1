Quote: USE OF TERM `ART UNION' The use of the term art union was under discussion at a meeting of the Auckland Society of the Arts ... Some time ago a letter was sent to the Minister of Internal Affairs asking if the term could be restricted in its use to that originally intended, namely the disposal of works of fine art. In his reply the Minister said: `The term is well established and its meaning well known in the community, and therefore it is not thought necessary to make specific change at this juncture.' Commenting on the present use of the term, the president ... said that it was obviously incorrect and that the present `art unions' were really lotteries.

Quote: How did the art union, now replaced by the Government's `Golden Kiwi' lottery, come by its name? Officers of the Internal Affairs Department said today they believed that under the law operating when the art unions began in 1929, raffles or lotteries could only have works of art for prizes. Alluvial gold had apparently qualified as a work of art and for some years the prizes were [pounds]4000 in alluvial gold, which had to be deposited in the Bank of New Zealand and paid for before any tickets could be sold. Cash finally replaced the alluvial gold prizes, but the name `art union' stuck.

Quote: The term `art union' is today used in a wider sense than the sense in which it is employed in the gaming legislation. The art union proper as defined in the Gaming Act exists only to a limited extent in New Zealand, and is confined to a few academies or societies of fine arts.  What has generally become known as the art union is the national lottery. The term `art union' is due to the fact that originally the prizes in the lottery were alluvial gold. These major art unions are now known as the Golden Kiwi lottery. .. In 1961 the Government decided to replace the art unions with the present Golden Kiwi lottery.

Quote: Art Union (forerunner of Golden Kiwi Lottery) <i>Ibid.</i> 6 Once when she couldn't have me Dad let me go to the flicks by myself. He gave me some extra money, so I went to the milkbar and bought a gobstopper and some other lollies. I stuffed my face, and felt crook all the way home. He bought new footy boots for my eldest brother too, and an Art Union ticket for Mum. He must have had a beaut time up the RSA that day, I reckon.
