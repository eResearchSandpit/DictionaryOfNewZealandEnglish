Quote: The Canterbury and Nelson regulations classified mining claims as alluvial, river, creek, beach, or quartz, and the shape and size of claims differed in each case. ... [footnote follows] The term `alluvial' was misapplied since river, creek and beach claims were strictly alluvial claims, too. The `alluvial claim' was defined in the regulations as a claim not in the watercourse or stream-bed of a creek or river. `Ordinary claim' was a more suitable term than `alluvial claim' and `ordinary' was adopted in the revised regulations of 1867-8.
