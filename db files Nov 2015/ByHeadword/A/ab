Quote: It's becoming increasingly fashionable to refer to them as "the ABs", especially among those on the outer circle of rugby who'd desperately like to be in the inner circle... Sport can sometimes be the theatre of the absurd and that would increase if the shortening craze caught on. The national cricket team would become known as the BCs, the netballers as the SFs, the soccer players as the AWs, the basketballers as the TBs.
