Notes: I have looked at both Dixon's "Triumphant Tour" and Daily Mail's "Why the All Blacks Triumphed" and I am convinced Romanos has been deceived by Wallace's 1964 statement in his dotage and probably in his drunkage as well. There is no phrase about "all the backs" in Buttery's reports which could have been buggered up by any typographer's slip of the pen.

Quote: Legend has it that the Hartlepool game so astonished those watching that least one writer referred to the team playing like "all backs" and that an "L" later somehow wriggled into the copy. Sportswriter Ron Palenski in his definitive book <i>The Jersey"</i> called it an enduring myth, pointing out that the team's manager kept a diary in which he referred to them as the All Blacks even while on board the ship taking them to Britain.

Quote: Buttery refers several times to the All Blacks.  He first uses the words in his second paragraph when he says, "the All Blacks, as the Colonials are dubbed"... The All Blacks had worn black jerseys since 1893 and the manager of the Originals, George Dixon, kept a copious diary on the tour (which has never been published but one day should be). In it, from the time the team left Wellington, he refers constantly to the team as "the All Blacks".

Quote: The name All Blacks was given to the first national rugby representatives to tour Britain, France and Canada, in 1905-06 (subsequently termed the originals, or Original All Blacks). Though no word could now be more Kiwi. it was in Fact coined by a Brit and used in British newspapers before being adopted back home (the players were named for their strip, and an alternative explanation involving inadvertent alteration of the phrase 'all backs' is flawed; see DNZE s.v. all black).
