Quote: The Auckland Green Gecko is found in the northern half of the North Island, north of Taranaki. The tail is very versatile, being used as a "fifth limb" to climb and for balance. It hunts by night for insects but also likes to sunbathe. The Auckland Green Gecko lives in scrub and forest areas, especially Kanuka and Manuka, also known as tea tree.

Quote: Two species of lizard will be released in a ceremony under Maori blessing to an "open sanctuary" being developed behind a 2.5km predator-proof fence over much of the 588ha coastal peninsula park. They include 12 threatened Auckland green geckos as well as more common grey and brown forest geckos, all gathered from the 7.5km route of the $365 million tolled motorway extension being built between Orewa and Puhoi.
