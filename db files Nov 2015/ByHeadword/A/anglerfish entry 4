Quote: Independently of the above, and much as we deplore the original connexion, which notwithstanding its not-to-be defended immorality, has lessened the crime of infanticide in a great degree, the numerous offspring, or Anglo-Zealanders, are so many perpetual ties, daily presented before their relations and tribes, on whom much marked kindness is invariably shewn by European visitors in the shape of presents to the parents and children; also the decided personal and, it will be hoped, moral improvements of this mixed race, caused through the intermarriage of British and native parents, through the medium of the missionaries.
