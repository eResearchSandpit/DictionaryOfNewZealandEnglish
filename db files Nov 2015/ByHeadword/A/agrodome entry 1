Quote: A past embodied in Robert's mother - eagerly at home amid the souvenir shops, her favourite outing the agrodome where the trained sheep (Leicester, Suffolk and Lincoln) are given drolly imperial names ("Monarch" and "Duke")... An almost imperceptible sense of loss tinges Robert's blank persona, but so uncertain is his connection to any personal reality that, when he is photographed with a prize ram at the agrodome, the print will show a look of "unimaginable happiness" on his face.
