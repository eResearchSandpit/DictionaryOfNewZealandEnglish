Quote: The Korari is the name of the flower stalk, often, but wrongly, used as the name of the plant. The edible root is the Aruhe. The word `Muka' is commonly applied to the dressed fibre; it is the correct name for the inner leaves. Cleared bush-land is suitable for the cultivation of the flax plant, and even swamp-land is improved by drainage. In the various flax swamps near nelson ...the finest plants grow upon the soil that has been thrown out of the ditch

Quote: They could [22] have satisfied most of the `kinaki' [ed fn: Relish eaten with other food] wants from the coast, but preferred forest products. You found the incoming Ngati-Porou along the coast following the fishing grounds and the warm areas for kumara and taro cultivation, while the `tangata whenua' stuck to the hinter-land and forests, faring  on `mamaku' [ed fn: Edible tree fern (<i>Cyathea medullaris</i>)], `aruhe', eels and huahua.
