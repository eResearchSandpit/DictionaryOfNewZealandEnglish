Quote: The most significant of these are African clubmoss (<i>Selaginella kraussiana</i>), which occurs widely along stream banks and in damp forest, where it displaces native ferns, mosses and liverworts, and common horsetail (<i>Equisetum arvense</i>), which is an extremely invasive weed of riverbank sites in high-rainfall areas.
