Quote: A number of readers have alerted me to an error in my recent column about Little Akaloa... I quoted Lona Waghorn's book about the history of this settlement, in which she stated that there is no L in the Maori alphabet...[They] all point out... that the letter L is very common in the southern Maori dialect (in particular, the Southland Murihuku variation), and Waghorn's book must have been published before about 1980, when the dialect was largely ignored and the acceptable standard was that spoken by Waikato Maori. Other place names, such as Lake Waihola in South Otago and the nearby settlement of Wangaloa, also show this dialectical variation. Still others have been helpfully changed to sound more "Maori", such as Rangiora and Kaikoura, which were recorded by one Captain Edwardson in 1823 as Rockiola and Kowkoula, because that was the way the southern tribes pronounced them.
