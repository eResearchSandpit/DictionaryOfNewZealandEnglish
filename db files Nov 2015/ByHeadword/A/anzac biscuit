Quote: The name of the biscuit says a lot about our national identity back in the 1920s, when recipes for Anzac biscuits were first published... One of the earliest biscuits to be given the name Anzac was not the recipe we use now, but one for a spicy rolled biscuit previously known as German biscuits. There were also Anzac cakes, which were a type of rock cake, and Anzac wafer was an ironic name for military hardtack.
