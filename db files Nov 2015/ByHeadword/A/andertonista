Quote: It is necessary to go back to the late 1980s, and a Labour Party in the process of division... To the left were the "Andertonistas," keepers of the flame of "democratic socialism"... To the right was "The Backbone Club," a rambunctious group of "radically conservative" Labourites, dedicated to protecting the achivements of Sir Roger Douglas and thwarting the dastardly intentions of Anderton and his trade union allies.
