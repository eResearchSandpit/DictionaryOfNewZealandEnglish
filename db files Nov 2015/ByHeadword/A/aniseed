The bush-like woods on the east side are of white birch, likewise no recommendation of the soil, but the chief objection to the district is, that the prairie soil affords scarcely any food for cattle ... it grows only the wiry tree grass [tussock] ... and <i>Phormium tenax</i> [flax], no aniseed, perennial groundsel, or milk thistle, and very little couch grass.

Quote: The outstanding plant in these preserves and the one that disappeared as the deer came along was aniseed. We do know that it was common everywhere once and gave a bright sheen, when in flower, to the whole of NorthCanterbury; but sheep appeared to relish it and, being a soft plant with no defence, it has vanished except on isolated bluffs and crannies.
