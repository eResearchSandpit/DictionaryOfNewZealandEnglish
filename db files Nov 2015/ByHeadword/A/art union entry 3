Quote: For cool impudence, a book agent on the warpath with a valuable work in 55 parts is hard to beat, but if there is anybody who can "go one better" it is the art union lottery man with 20,000 tickets to sell at a shilling a piece. The book agent does his own bullying, and wheedling; the art unionist asks you to do it for him on a 20 percent commission. . . Accompanying this letter. . is a printed circular setting forth the merits of the engravings. "It is certain," says the lottery man, "that many a mind will warm with enthusiasm on becoming possessed of such admirable works of art, which are now placed within the reach of a discerning public at the trifling risk of one shilling."

Quote: [Correspondence] A LOTTERY `SWINDLE'. ... The `Art Union' system in confectionary [sic] is understood by all reasonable people to be one of risk as the whole or perhaps a large portion of that manufactured may never be required, if tickets are not sold - and therefore a considerble margin of risk of the kind is always allowed. Our profit, if any, has yet to be ascertained. Next  week if we get in the price of our tickets we will be able to tell. [The raffle or Art Union was apparently for gingerbread or gingerbread cake as a prize.]
