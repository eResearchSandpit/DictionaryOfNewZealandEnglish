Quote: In the high country calendar there is one event that, more than any other, signifies the approach of winter - the autumn muster. It is the time when the musterers and their dogs head for the tops to bring the sheep down to their wintering paddocks. It is the time when reputations are made and broken for men and dogs alike. The autumn muster epitomises the skill of the New Zealand stockman.
