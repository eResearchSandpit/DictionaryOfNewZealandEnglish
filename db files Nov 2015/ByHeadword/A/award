The award of the Court of Arbitration, q.v., or any reference to it under the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1954. `An industrial award is in form a judicial decree, but in substance it is an act of legislative authority. It is the establishment of a set of authoritative rules regulating an industry, and determining not the present rights and obligations of litigants, but the future relations and mutual rights and obligations of all persons who thereafter during the currency of the award choose to enter into contractual relations with each other as employers and employed in that industry.' New Zealand Waterside Workers' Federation, Industrial Association of Workers, q.v.  Frazer [1924] N.Z.L.R. 689, 709, per Salmond J.
