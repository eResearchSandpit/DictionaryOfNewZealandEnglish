Notes: n.1. /|akiaki/, /|a.kia.*k(i)/. Also aki(aki), ake(ake) /*ki*k(*)/; variation in the form and use of this word arises from (a) three basic forms of spg: (i) ake, (ii) incorrect aki, (iii) with redupl.; (b) confusion with the form aka (and its spg var.), the gen.Ma. term for climbing plant, applied specifically to climbing rata spp. (the wood of the rata is also dense and tough) and to various spg aka, aki, etc; and (c) the application of ake(ake) to other genera with tough durable wood e.g. Olearia. [Ma. /ake/ W.6 Ake (i) ... Dodonaea viscosa, a tree. = ake-rautangi. ... akeake ... Dodonaea viscosa, Olearia traversii and other species, trees.: OED2.]
