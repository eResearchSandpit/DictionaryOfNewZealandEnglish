Quote: In repose Arapawas carry their heads rather low, and it is this tendency coupled with low-set long tails, which gives them a hunched look. Their most common colouring is all black - with a depth of blackness which is particularly striking in the lambs - but Arapawas may often have white points and on very rare occasions be pure white. The most strikingly coloured are those which are spotted with white over the whole body, and weich are often referred to as 'cocktail' Arapawas.
