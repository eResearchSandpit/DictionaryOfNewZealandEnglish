Quote: <i>Lembophyllum clandestinum</i> (H.f. & W.) Lindb. Maori names: <i>Angiangi, kohukohu </i>... Goldie listed `angiangi' as <i>Hypnum clandestinum</i>, a `fern', but <i>H. clandestinum</i> is a moss, now known as <i>Lembophyllum clandestinum</i>. [Williams identifies angiangi as <i>Usnea barbata</i>, a lichen, and it is probable that the word was applied generally to soft absorbent mosses and lichens.]
