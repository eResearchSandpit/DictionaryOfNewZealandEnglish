Quote: `All aboard! All aboard!' is the cry./ They're a ripping lot of shearers in the shed;/ ... / `Wool away! Wool away!' is the cry/ And the merry game of busting is begun!/ They're going sheep and sheep, for Big Mick will do or die,/ And the fleecy boys are kept upon the run./ ... [fn] In old-time sheds these calls indicated the beginning and end of a run.
