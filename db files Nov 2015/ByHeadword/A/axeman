Quote: ... I dimly remember as a youngster in the days when the Forty-Mile Bush was still standing, such a drink as `matai beer' was sometimes spoken of amongst bushmen. Apparently it was made from the sap of the matai tree, extracted by the simple process of boring an auger-hole in the trunk. ... Can any old-timer axeman give any information concerning this liquor.

Quote: Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.
