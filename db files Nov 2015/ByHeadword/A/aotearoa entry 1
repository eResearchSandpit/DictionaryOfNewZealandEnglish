Quote: Nineteenth-century suggestions for English renaming have had a counterpart in more recent calls for a change in favour of the Maori name <i>Aotearoa</i> (formerly also <i>Aotea-roa, Ao-tea-roa</i>; a shortened form <i>Ao-tea</i> is attested as well)... In <i>DNZE</i> the earliest unequivocal use of <i>Aotearoa</i> for the whole country in an English source is 1878.

Quote: Aotearoa is the Maori name for New Zealand, though it seems at first to have been used for the North Island only. Many meanings have been given for the name but with Maori names the true meaning can often be found only in a mythological story or in historical fiction illustrating either how the name was given or something of the ideas which prompted  it. Aotearoa is made up of either two or three words, Aotea  and roa or Ao tea and roa. Aotea could be the name of one of the canoes of the great migration, the great magellan cloud near the  bright star Canopus in summer, a bird or even a food; ao is a  cloud, dawn, daytime, or world; tea, white or clear,perhaps bright, while roa means long or tall.

Quote: So Aotearoa received its name - a name that has been responsible for many interpretations. Popularly and perhaps correctly rendered Land of the Long White Cloud, its component syllables are ao: cloud or daylight; tea: white or clear; roa: long. On his return to the Homeland Kupe was asked why he had not named the the new land Irihia (one of the earlier Hawaikis) or Te  Honi-i-wairua (The Circumnavigation of spirits ?) to which he replied, `I preferred the warm breast to the cold one, the new land to the old land long forsaken.'

Quote: Aotearoa /aotea|roa, pop. eI tI -|r /. N.Z. [Maori, = long white cloud (but see below).] A Maori name for New Zealand.  The meaning of the word is disputed,  Aotea could be the name of one of the migration canoes, the great magellan cloud near the bright star Canopus in summer, a bird, of a food; alternatively,  ao means a cloud, dawn, daytime, or world;  tea, white, clear, bright; roa long, tall. The most popular and enduring meaning assigned to is `long white cloud'. (See McLintock  Encyl. N.Z. (1966) I. 53.) Some authorities say that  Aotearoa was first applied to the North Island only.

Quote: `The name Aotearoa was made popular around 1898 with the publication of William Pember Reeves' book The Long White Cloud - Aotearoa,' historian ... Sir Keith Sinclair says. After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand.  Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper.  Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s.  Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand byusing `te motu nei' (in this island).  Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `landof the long twilight'.  The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand.
