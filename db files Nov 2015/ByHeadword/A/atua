While the soul is received by the good Ea-tooa, an evil spirit is also in readiness to carry the impure part of the corpse to the above road, along which it is carried to Terry-inga, whence it is precipitated into the sea.

Quote: Six days men were allowed to work, and every seventh day was appointed as a day of rest from labour, and to keakea atua; for this was the only term which we could then make use of in order to convey to their ideas our worshipping the Supreme Being.  <i>Ibid.</i>  26 July 69 I think atua is their name for the Supreme Being, but I am not certain. <i>Ibid.</i> 11 Mar 75 The natives say if this should be allowed atua would be angry and a heavy calamity would befall them. <i>Ibid.</i> 77 Atua had then, as it was conceived, entered into him. Hence he was taboo (tapu) himself, or a sacred person. No New Zealander was permitted to come near him except the togungha (tohunga) or priest and those of his own family. <i>Ibid.</i> 14 July 138  The chiefs and elders of the people are called atua even whilst they are living. One aged friend, Terra (Tara) says that the god of thunder is in his forehead.
