Quote: The first tramping club was formed in 1919 and many more followed in the twenties. A hardy lot they must have been. Heavy leather boots studded with hobnails or clinkers on the soles, kidney-crusher' or A-frame packs, and canvasor cotton tents ... <i>Ibid.</i> 78 For instance [a past generation's] packs (or swags as somewould have been calling them) would be A-frame`kidney-bruiser, kidney-rotter, kidney-crusher' types with billies dangling off the back and tents lashed to the outside.
