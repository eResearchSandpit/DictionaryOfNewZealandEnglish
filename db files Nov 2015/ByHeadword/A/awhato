Quote: ... the <i>aweto</i>, or vegetable-caterpillar, called by the naturalists <i>Hipialis virescens</i>. It is a perfect caterpillar in every respect, and a remarkably fine one too, growing to a length , in the largest specimens of three and a half inches and the thickness of a finger, but more commonly to about a half or two thirds of that size. ... When full-grown, it undergoes a miraculous change. For some inexplicable reason, the spore of the vegetable fungus <i>Sphaeria Robertsii</i>, fixes itself on its neck, or between the head and the first ring of the caterpillar, takes root and grows vigorously ... exactly like a diminutive bulrush from 6 to 10 inches high without leaves, and consisting solely of a single stem with a dark-brown felt-like head, so familiar in the bulrushes ... always at the foot of the rata.
