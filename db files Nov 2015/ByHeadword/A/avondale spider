Quote: There are quite a few Australian spider species that <i>did</i> make it to New Zealand on a permanent basis. One of the bigger ones is our mate, the Avondale spider (<i>Delena cancerides</i>)... Here in New Zealand the Avondale spider still causes the odd stir when it suddenly appears from nowhere in the peri-domestic environment of Avondale, New Lynn and Blockhouse Bay. The species is thought to have arrived about a hundred years ago, in the stacks of Australian hardwood timber from which the Avondale racecourse building was constructed.

Quote: The latest New Zealand sensation to hit Hollywood is a bark-eating spider from Avondale... Why the Avondale spider? Truth be told, the <i>Delana</i> is really the Australian huntsman spider, but since the species is indigenous to Australia, it could not be exported from there.

Quote: According to Marshall, in Auckland to promote the film recently, the Avondale spiders that landed the part were head and thorax in front of all the other contenders. They're big, they're furry, they look bloody mean and, maybe more important, they're absolutely harmless.
