Quote: All that was necessary to ensure the most complete success was that a canoe should come down the bay in the evening so as to reach the spot a little after dark, and then, without the slightest fear of interruption, the place might have been rifled, and before daylight the canoe would be away back through the French Pass, and the booty effectually secured in any one of the thousand adjacent bays, where it might have safely remained, and be conveyed across the Straits at convenient opportunities.
