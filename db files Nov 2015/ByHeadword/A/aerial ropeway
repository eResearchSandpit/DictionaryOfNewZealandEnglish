Quote: Wellington [on the downturn in aerial topdressing]  Aerial ropeway: A pair of overhead cables along which steel buckets suspended from a carrier were hauled by an endless rope. The system was used for delivering ore from the Grand Junction main shaft hoppers to the battery. Such ropeways have a large capacity and are very economical to operate.
