Quote: <i> amokura</i>, an ocean bird (Phaethon rubricauda), red-tailed tropic-bird: the two long springly feathers of the tail used as plume in head-dress. Amokura is the Maori name: in the Pacific it is tavake, and the Maori has that word, with the usual letter-change, tawake, in an ancient whakatauki (proverb or sententious saying), but that name has otherwise been forgotten in New Zealand, where the bird is found only after storms in the Pacific, and then usually dead on the shore.

Quote: The early Wesleyan and English Church Mission missionaries, who arrived in New Zealand in the early years of the century, found the Ngapuhi tribe of the far north in possession of the red tail feathers of the tropic bird, which were then much prized decorating the heads of chiefs on festive days. The bird is known to the Natives under the name of Amokura.

Quote: Dr Newman says the amokura is really a native of the tropical islands of the Pacific, and is only a visitor to New Zealand, though accounted by some to be a native. It was on account of its rarity that the Maori chiefs of the old days prized the feathers of the amokura, especially as the feathers are tinged with the sacred kura, or red colour.
