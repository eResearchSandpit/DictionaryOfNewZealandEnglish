Quote: Few soldiers in Egypt use the word piastre... The almost universal Army term for them is "akkers"... When soldiers found they would have to refer to their money as piastres, it did not take them long to substitute "disaster"... It may have been a concert party gag at first.. to talk of owing a friend five "accidents", and the abbreviation to "aker" or "akker" - there seems to be no defined spelling - followed as a matter of course.
