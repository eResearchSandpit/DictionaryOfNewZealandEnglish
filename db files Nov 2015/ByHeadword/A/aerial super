Quote: Aerial super is a mixture of straight super and of serpentine. The addition of the serpentine makes the product safer for aerial topdressing because it flows more freely, but there is a 10 percent loss in phosphate concentration. The production of aerial super is falling - it now makes up only about 3 percent of the total.  It's a very specialised industry - aerial agriculture.
