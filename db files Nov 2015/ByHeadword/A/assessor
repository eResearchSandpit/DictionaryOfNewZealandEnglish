Quote: They then went furiously to the 4th point - that we were all hirelings and worked for money like the Assessors. One fellow said, `Don't you get your quarter?' I replied, `Certainly! I do not live by stealing.' `Quarter' has, of late years, become a proverbial term; the Government Native Assessors, being paid once a quarter, talk commonly of getting their quarters. The Kingites despise these Maoris who have been bribed over, and hate and deride the `quarter' as conclusive of all that is bad. Hanauru, the King's great priest, who was present, pointed out how he could go about anywhere, all the year round, and wanted  no quarter.
