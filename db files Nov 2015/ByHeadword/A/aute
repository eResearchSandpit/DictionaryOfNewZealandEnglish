Quote: Your general conclusions in `The Evolution of Maori Clothing' of local development based on  phormium as opposed to `aute' and the necessities of a colder climate, may have to be reviewed if it is found that a Western Pacific wave had established the art of working flax in Pre-Toi times.

Quote: Maori were once kite-fliers, forming kites from tapa, having brought the aute tree, or paper mulberry, from their ancestral home to Aotearoa. Just a couple of small, early-twentieth century examples made of indigenous materials - raupo leaves, flax fibre, toetoe, harrier feathers, cutty grass - are on view, along with a contemporary birdman kite, or manu aute.

Quote: The ancestors of Maori brought the plant, know[sic] as "aute" to New Zealand and cultivated it. I had always believed it hadn't survived the climate here but there is evidence it was growing and flourishing in the Hokianga in 1840 until it was superseded by woven cloth brought by pakeha traders.
