Quote: [Hdg] The "Anzac" Buffet... The opening of the Anzac Buffet at No. 70 Victoria Street, by the Australian Natives' Association, has been hailed with delight by Australian and New Zealand soldiers visiting London after leaving hospital...

Quote: Discussions are still rampant concerningthe origin, meaning and application ofthe word "Anzac". The Morning Post hassuddenly awoken to the fact that itsorigin was the Turkish word "anzak,"meaning "to jump," which, together withthe fact that there are kangaroos inAustralia and that Australasian soldiersjumped ashore at Anzac, finally provesthat that is the derivation, and thatcode words of initial letters had nothingto do with it.
