Quote: The tradition [of absentee ownership] is continuing, as Chris points out, not only in the sometimes close and personal links between families of owners and managers, but with the emerging phenomenon of company ownership. An example is the Fletcher properties: "It's a different type of absentee ownership, but it is still absentee ownership."
