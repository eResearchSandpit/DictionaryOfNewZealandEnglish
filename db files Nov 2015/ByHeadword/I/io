Quote: ..Kosetatino Tufele, 65, said "io" (yes) when asked if he had voted in favour of Tokelau changing its status to become self-governing in free association with New Zealand. .. Like other Tokelauans in Samoa for public service work, medical treatment, study or private visits, Mr Tufele had the oportunity to cast his vote in the capital, Apia.
