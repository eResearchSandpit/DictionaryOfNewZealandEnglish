Quote: Mr Blumsky, however, said "intergenerational debt" was a fair way of paying for projects that would benefit future generations of Wellingtonians. "Why should I pay for a pipe that's going to last a hundred years and pay the entire cost of it? Surely I should pay some of it, but then those people that are coming along should pay some of it too. The only way you can do that is funding it through debt - that's why they call it intergenerational debt."
