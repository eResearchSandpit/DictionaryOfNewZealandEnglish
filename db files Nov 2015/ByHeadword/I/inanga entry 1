Quote: `About the same size as this fish [the cockabully] is the `inaka' much used for bait. Indeed, it is called the New Zealand whitebait. A friend from Victoria having used this bait, I asked him to spell the name of the fish, and he wanted to make it like the patriarch who `walked with God' Enoch-a. The more correct shape of the Maori word is inanga; but in the South Island `k' often takes the place of that distinctive Maori letter `ng', as `kainga' becomes kaik; ngaio, kaio.'

The fry of these fish run up the river in spring, under the name of `whitebait', though the whitebait of the market consists of galaxias attenuatus only.

It enjoys a name, <i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>.
