Quote: Michael House's victory flourish right on the line in the Interdominion Trotters' Final might have been spoiled by the photo finish camera... Prentice spent much of yesterday reflecting on an Interdominion campaign in which almost everything fell into place... Prentice hopes the pacer will give him a twin-pronged attack in next year's Perth Interdom.
