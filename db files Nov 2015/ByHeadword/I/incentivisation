Quote: Though there had once been some suggestion that the government would pay the whole cost of establishing <i>Te Papa</i>, the new catchphrase was <i>incentivisation</i> - which, translated into plain English, meant something like : "Give those arty types everything they ask for and let them spend it how they like? Get out of here. They can sweat for it."
