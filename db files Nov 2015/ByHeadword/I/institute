Quote: The Institute movement is unique in that it is solely, and strictly, for country women, the formation of an Institute being permitted, by the rules of the organisation, only in a place with fewer than 4,000 inhabitants.  In some ways allied to the Institute movement is the Women's Division of the Farmers' Union.
