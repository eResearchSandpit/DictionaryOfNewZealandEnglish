Quote: When next I rode home via Frank Hull's, I found my way blocked by an obstruction called in the north a 'Taranaki' gate, and in the south an 'Irishman's', consisting of three wires tied to the post and a couple of battens nailed to them to hold it erect and fastened at the opening by a loop of wire at the top and bottom of the opposite post, through which the end batten was slipped.
