Quote: Iwi (now often translated as "tribes") were, at this time, idealised categories of related hapu that almost never acted as corporate groups... <i>Ibid.</i> 8 Iwi might have remained as ideal kin-categories, had it not been for British colonialism and Maori responses to it.

Quote: The smallest sociological unit is the biological family, which the Maoris termed whanau, derived from whanau, to give birth . ... The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expandedfamily group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors ... The term iwi (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thusrelated to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the iwi has been termed tribe and the hapu a sub-tribe.
