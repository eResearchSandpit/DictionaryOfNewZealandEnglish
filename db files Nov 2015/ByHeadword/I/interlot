Quote: Lines with less than four complete bales are considered unsatisfactory and the broker therefore endeavours to build up even, saleable lines by a system of `interlotting.' Bales of wool belonging to different vendors but of the same type and class are grouped together. Interlotted lines thus consist of a number of bales selected from the offerings of several different vendors.
