Quote: Intercultivation.- In all districts subject to dry summers the question of putting at least a portion of the arable land under intercultivated crops should receive attention. By shallow surface cultivation a mulch is kept upon the surface, and soils thus treated part with their moisture far less rapidly than where intercultivation is neglected.
