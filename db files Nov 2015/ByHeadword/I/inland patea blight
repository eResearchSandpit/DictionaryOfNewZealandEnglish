Quote: There used to be a complaint brought on by loneliness, peculiar to the area, that people up there were liable to. Inland Patea blight, it was called. If not attended to directly the first symptoms appeared, it could become real serious. ... directly one was noticed wearing a hawk's feather in his hat, it was a sure sign he'd got the blight, and it was - look out!!
