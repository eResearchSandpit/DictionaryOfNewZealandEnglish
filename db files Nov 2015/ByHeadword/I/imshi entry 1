Quote: Natives used to come along and try to sell boiled eggs. Their cry was 'Eggs a cook, Eggs a Cook!'. The men didn't want them so they used to say 'Imshee, Tallah!' which means 'Go! Clear out!' Well, the wounded told us that when the Australians charged with their bayonet they yelled at the top of their voices 'Eggs a Cook! Imshee. Tallah! Eggs a Cook! Imshee! Tallah!' It had become their war-cry.
