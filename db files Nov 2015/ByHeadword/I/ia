Quote: To build Britomart they need $91.5m from a body called Infrastructure Auckland (IA), formed when it was decided, uncharacteristically, not to give each Aucklander a share of the spoils from selling the city's assets, but to keep money to buy the little things that make life better, like transport. IA is meeting today to decide whether it will hand over the cash.
