Quote: ... finally there is a supply of potatoes of seed size which cannot be sold for purposes of replanting. This material, described commercially as "island smalls," finds an outlet particularly in the export trade to Fiji - which island takes most of the potatoes shipped from this country to the Pacific Islands - where it is consumed by the native population.
