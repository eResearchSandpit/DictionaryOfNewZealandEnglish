Quote: The fish [snapper] caught on the long line are normally still alive when landed. Nowadays these are usually iki-spiked, a process of spiking the fish through the brain to kill it instantly. The iki-spiking splays the fins, accentuates the reddish colour and the individual blue spots, and, most important of all, delays the onset of rigor and so makes the flesh firmer. Unfortunately, most of this snapper goes to the lucrative Japanese market.
