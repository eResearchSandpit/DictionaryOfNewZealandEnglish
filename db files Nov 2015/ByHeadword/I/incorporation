Notes: Jim Cameron writes : The definition in DNZE seems defective (cf my comment on <i>Maori land</i>). It refers to 'the consolidation of customary titles of the Maori owners" but as the citation from the Native Land Act shows what was (and is) consolidated are titles to <i>Maori freehold land</i>. The incoporation originated with the Native Land Court Act 1894, and according to Smith, <i>Maori Land Corporations </i> (1962) its original purpose was to facilitate the alienation of Maori land. Also <i>Maori incorporation</i>, a variant I could not find in DNZE.
