Quote: In pawn: New Zealand: since ca. 1920. In, e.g., The Press (Christchurch, New Zealand), special report of Oct 18 1939, `He had a `spark' in Moscow (meaning in pawn), a spark being a diamond ring; extant. The Australian form, current since ca. 1935, and recovered by Baker, 1942, is gone to Mascow or moscowed; in Australia, too, Moscow may be used independently to mean `a pawnshop'. By 1945, in both countries, the n., the v. and the phrase were low s. Mascow being regarded as distant remote.
