Quote: Intercultivation.- In all districts subject to dry summers the question of putting at least a portion of the arable land under intercultivated crops should receive attention. By shallow surface cultivation a mulch is kept upon the surface, and soils thus treated part with their moisture far less rapidly than where intercultivation is neglected. One repeatedly sees abundant crops of kale, maize &c., so treated standing alongside crops of the same kind grown in the same paddock but not intercultivated, and which in consequence have withered and died.
