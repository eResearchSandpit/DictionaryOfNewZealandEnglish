Quote: Irishman scrub; Also called Wild Irishman, or Matagouri. A hard prickly scrub, almost leafless, which grows on almost any land and stands any amount of drought or frost. The early settlers always called it by its English names: but since the [1914-1918] war it is as often asnot called by its Maori one. It is very good firewood, and station cooks used it largely for baking  bread. Should its English names drop out of use they will be perpetuated in the names of many paddocks and flats; also in the name of Irishman['s] Creek Station.
