Quote: For what is a parade without a brass band? And a band without the "Invercargill March"? ... Chaulk said: The "Invercargill March" is the absolute thick edge of the traditional wedge... And the wonderfully swaggering "Invercargill March"? That was composed by Alex Lithgow, whose note at the top of the first page read: "To Invercargill, the Southernmost City in New Zealand (End of the World), and its Citizens. I dedicate this March as a memento of the many pleasant years spent there in my boyhood."
