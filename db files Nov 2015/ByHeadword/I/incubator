Quote: The pair has signed a historic deal to supply the know-how for China to pick out the hi-tech companies in an ambitious plan to roll out 1000 business incubator parks by 2005... "The business incubator and science park community is very small globally, but it's a very powerful niche for us"... An unincubated hi-tech company stands an 80% chance of going belly-up. In an incubator which provides advanced services like computer networking and mentoring which are scare resources in many countries, that rises to an 80% chance of survival over two to five years.
