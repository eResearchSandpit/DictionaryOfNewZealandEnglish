Quote: There is a plant the Maoris call `Tainui'. It is interesting because of its association with a tradition that a specimen in the North Island sprang from a green timber used in the building of the `Tainui', a canoe which brought some of the Maori immigrants to New Zealand between five and six hundred years ago.
