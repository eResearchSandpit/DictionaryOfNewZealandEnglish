Quote: Winston McCarthy was the country's outstanding sport's broadcaster at a time when there were many such celebrities... He was Winston McCarthy, the voice of rugby. In 1945, Lieutenant Winston McCarthy was seconded to the New Zealand Broadcasting Service to tour England and Europe with the Kiwi rugby team... It was during this tour [of the UK} that he developed is own distinctive call, "Listen for it... It's a goal". It became the catchcry that highlighted his commentaries; it was the quintessence of his style and personality... His legacy "Listen for it..." still remains vivid in the memory of all those who listened to him.
