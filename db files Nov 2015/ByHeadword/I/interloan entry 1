Notes: Jim writes : in full <i>interlibrary loans</i>. The NZ beginning of the system was in 1936. Not in any dictionary I have seen; NSOD records <i>interlibrary</i> and Collins <i>interlibrary loan</i>. The latter was used e.g. in the 1969 Census of Librtaries but the 1979 Census referred to <i>library interloans</i>.
