Quote: We observed a great difference betwixt the inhabitants on this side of the land, north of Cook's Straits, and those of the south. ... the latter are a set of poor wretches, who, though strong, are stinted in their growth, and seem to want the spirit or sprightliness of the northern Indians.

Quote: One old Indian ... [uses (New) Zealanders also] <i>Ibid.</i> 2/218 Dec. 18 Mr Rowe had been accustomed to Indians in America for many years having been in America the greatest part of his time & put too great confidence in them [the New Zealanders], for had he been more doubtful of them he might have saved his life and that of his Crew. ...

Quote: The new [sic] Zealanders of Charlotte Sound were never so much amongst us as at this time, the reason probably because they found more was to be got and that we parted with our goods on easier terms, than ever we had done before, for our folks were all so eager after Curiosities and withall so much better provided than in any other Voyage - that our traffic with the Indians was quite spoilt - A Nail last Voyage purchasing more that an Ax or a Hatchet now - before our departure they carried Hatchets under their Cloaths instead of Patows. The Zealander often appear'd to have a great deal of Friendship For Us - speaking sometimes in the most tender compassionate tone of Voice imaginable - ...
