Quote: Immersion students performed slightly worse on the other tasks... About 30 per cent of immersion students had been at such schools for less than two years, had limited Maori-language skills and would have done better of their tests were in English. Immersion students were more interested in science and art and thought they were better at the subjects than the others.
