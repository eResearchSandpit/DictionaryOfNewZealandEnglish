Notes: 1951 16+ M 32 St Mary's, Wgton 30B CACTUS, IN THE CACTUS -(phs influenced by the phrs in the cack, in the poop, of similar meaning: cf cack-handed `awkward').  Cactus was the code name of Guadalcanal which was a very rough and remote place to be during most of the war; therefore `up in the Cactus' had a particular aptness'. (?Were the code names given by US or British authorities.) (Cf cactus stove, and compare North African equivalent Benghasi burner.) There was some contact between men in the Islands and men in North Africa (cf coconut bombers). If `in the cactus' was revived (or even recoined) in the sense `remote place, boohai, could it not become associated with the other sense (2), and a similar sense of <i>boohai</i> `up the shoot ; awry ; askew ; in the shit'.
