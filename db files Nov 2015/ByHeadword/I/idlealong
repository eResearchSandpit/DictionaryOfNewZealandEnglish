Quote: Less than ten years ago Mr. Alf Harvey,of Wellington, conducted a series ofexperiments in an effort to evolve asuitable small class racer, and theresults of his efforts are seen today inthe ever-increasing fleet of Idle Alongcraft... The boats are of a restrictedtype and measure 12.8 feet overall, andhave a beam of approximately 6 feet. Theyare built on the square chine principle,with a good rise in floor forward ofamidships, which flattens out to a broadtuck stern. The original model was gunterrigged, but it was found.. the boatsperform better with a Bermudian rig.
