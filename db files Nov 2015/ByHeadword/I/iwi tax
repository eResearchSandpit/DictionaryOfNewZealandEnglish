Quote: An iwi tax is a second mini-Treaty settlement (March 6). Any cost to commercial fishermen is naturally tax-deductible, thus lessening the tax take. Taxpayers will have to make this up in some other way.

Quote: It's obvious that the government doesn't have a problem with the iwi tax being levied on commercial use of Lake Ellesmere (March 6) and this attitude indicates there won't be much in the way of accountability for the revenue.

Quote: Commercial users of the Waikato River should prepare themselves for an "iwi tax" after Ngai Tahu imposed a conservation levy on eel fishermen at Lake Ellesmere in the South Island. Mr Smith described the levy as the forerunner to a new nationwide iwi tax system after his group of eel fishermen were asked to contribute $29,000, or 8 per cent of the total annual eel fishery earnings of $360,000, to Ngai Tahu for Lake Ellesmere environmental restoration purposes. The iwi also receives revenue for leasing out its quota.
