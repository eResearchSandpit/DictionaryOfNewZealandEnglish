Quote: Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholdedwithout warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial  Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (I.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered.
