Notes: If this is whitey-wood =mahoe, inau is prob. a mistake or mishearing or local misuse of hinahina; but the word is phs confused with hinau [check whether hinau is a bucket of water wood. Whitey-wood certainly burns. There is (Williams) a Ma. inaho glossed merely as `a shrub'. I think RH has got this well mixed up as she has with marae.

Quote: He steered the boy to a scraggly trunk of inau. ... `That's whitey-wood,' said Starkie. ... `He thinks those old inau trees are sacred ...' [155] `Whitey-wood won't burn. You know it won't burn even if you put a ton of coal on it.'
