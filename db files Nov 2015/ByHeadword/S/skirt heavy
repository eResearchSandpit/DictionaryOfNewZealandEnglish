Quote: Almost 15 years ago the phrase that filtered down from stock agent to farmer and thence to the battler in the woolshed was 'skirt heavy.' In other words, when a fleece was thrown on the table, you were expected to tear off large strips of any wool which might conceivably be a little inferior to the best part of the fleece.
