Notes: Jim Cameron writes: the term is not in DNZE, and it is not personally known to me, but an informat tells me shed brooms were standard in Otago woolsheds in the 1970s. DEH notes large brooms known as shed brooms were also used in cowsheds to sweep down the shed after milking as far back as the 1930s.
