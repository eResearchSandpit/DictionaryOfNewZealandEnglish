Quote: The islands' only endemic seabird is the Snares crested penguin, which stands a little less than knee high and has a jazzy yellow head-crest, a tangerine-coloured bill, pink feet and smart black-and-white plumage. (A small number of birds display a phenomenon called isabellinism, in which the back feathers are pale fawn).<i>Ibid.</i> 66 [Hdg] Like corks in a maelstrom, Snares crested penguins bob about in the churning surf waiting for a wave to lift them onto shore... Snares crested penguins are one of four species of crested penguins - three of them endemic - which breed in New Zealand waters. All possess a pair of distinctive bands called supercilliary stripes, which run from the bill to the back of the head like giant yellow eyebrows... When the feathers are dry, the bands fluff out to create the classic crested-penguin "punk rocker" look...
