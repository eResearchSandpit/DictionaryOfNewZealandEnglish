Quote: <i>Stagknife </i>(K-31), a universal game of nineteenth-century childhood, was important because it was played with the most treasured play object of all boys, the pocket knife. Although known in nearly all parts of New Zealand by the name of Stagknife, the game was also known as Bites, Jackknife, Stabknife, Knifey, Momley Peg, and Throwing the Knife. ... There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

Quote:  ... but `stagknife' or `stick-knife' was mainly played by the boys; it provided some thrilling moments when the skilled player would somersault a sharp pocket knife twice or three times off his forehead, nose or chin into the ground.
