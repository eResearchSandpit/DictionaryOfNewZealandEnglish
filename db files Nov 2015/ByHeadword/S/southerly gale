Quote: In Cook's Straits, the southerly gales commence with great force about ten o'clock in the morning, increasing in violence until they terminate in gales, accompanied by squalls, raising heavy seas in the channel, which are further augmented as the opposing tide takes place towards sunset, the violence of the gale then subsides, and within an hour after the disappearance of the great luminary a perfect calm prevails, which generally continues during the night, and the following morning until about nine o'clock, when the same warring of the elements is repeated.
