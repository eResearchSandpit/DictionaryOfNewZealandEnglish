Quote: Thinking of the coming Waitangi celebrations, wouldn't you like to see Kiri Te Kanawa in 1990 singing "God Defend New Zealand", draped in the Southern Cross, on a bullock wagon going down Lambton Quay, with pirouetting Pavlovas, and a working model of hell-on-wheels, the second-class smoker on the old Limited Express? You could probably export the telefilm to France!
