Quote: The Carpet Shark is well known to all sport and commercial fishermen, who call it the Ground Shark. ...It has been called Ground Shark as it is usually found on the ground or floor of the ocean, and is not found roaming the surface of the sea, as in most other species of shark.

Quote: <i>Carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella</i> Alternative names include swell shark (from its ability to inflate with water or air) and catshark (its eyes are like a cat's). The latter is more appropriate than carpet shark as a common name; the true tropical to subtropical carpet sharks are unrelated.
