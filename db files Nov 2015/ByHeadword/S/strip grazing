Quote: Strip grazing is where a temporary electric fence is used to offer a strip of pasture in a paddock each day to the herd/flock, normally without a back fence to keep animals off previously grazed pasture. Block grazing differs from strip grazing to the extent that the herd/flock is offered pasture on a daily basis with both a front and back temporaray electric fence, and daily blocks are rectangular in shape.
