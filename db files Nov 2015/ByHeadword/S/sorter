Quote: Unskirted wools are legitimately for acquirement by sorters and scourers, those people who after purchase do to the fleeces what the grower should have done, and which he could more easily and cheaply do than the buyer, for when a fleece is taken off the sheep and thrown on the skirting table, what should be taken off, or out, is more easily seen and done than when these fleeces have been rolled up with their imperfections, pressed tight in the bales, and have to be unrolled and properly attended to at a sorter's or a scourer's establishment.
