Quote: This was the rugby scrum machine, an almost standard item of equipment at any rugby practice today.  The first mention of a rugby scrum machine occurred at Auckland in 1926.  The Varsity Colts club team, coached by Athol Miller, used to train each week at a shed in Parnell.  Miller rigged up chaff bags on a wooden frame for the forwards to scrum against - it was a functional and rather crude arrangement.
