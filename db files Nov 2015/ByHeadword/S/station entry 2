Quote: It is noteworthy that the word `station' is commonly used for big sheep-farms in the South Island, especially in the hill country. It is less common in the North Island. `Station' has a proprietorial and almost regal air. The names used to fascinate me from a distance, and they still do, especially now that I have seen a good deal of the high sheep country. `Leslie Hills', `Cora Lynn', `Mt White', `Mesopotamia', `The Wolds', `Horsley Downs', `The Grampians', `Orari Gorge', `Mt Peel', `Braemar', and `Benmore' - they have an atmosphere.
