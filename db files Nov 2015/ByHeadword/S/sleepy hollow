Quote: Nelson being sometimes called "sleepy hollow," has been, until now, pretty free of such frolicsome characters, but it seems one or two individuals are begining [sic] buckyism practices; by inserting a few of the absurdities in your valuable paper may, perhaps, prevent the malady extending to others, as even the winners are found to be on the losing side when they appear in the Resident Magistrate's Court.

Quote: At that time Nelson claimed among its citizens such prominent figures in the later life of the country as Sir William Fox, Mr. Alfred Domett, and Sir Francis Bell, the father of the late Leader of the Legislative Council, and it may not be a mere vain conceit to feel that the presence of such gentlemen in the midst of a community, remembering the charms of Captain Wakefield, did much to perpetuate in Nelson a measure of courtesy, hospitality, and integrity that gives "Sleepy Hollow" a charm that any community might envy.
