Quote: A radio transmitter recorder ("snark") is placed in the areas where males repeatedly emit their low frequency boom... When kakapo pass a "snark", it detects the radio frequency from each bird's transmitter.

Quote: The innovation centres around a portable black box, known as a 'Snark', which contains a radio receiver, data logger and special computer software package. Once placed in the forest, the Snark records the movements of any birds within, say, a 10 metre radius and stores this on its memory. Staff can then come along with a portable mini-computer, plug it into the Snark, and find out what birds have been in the area overnight.
