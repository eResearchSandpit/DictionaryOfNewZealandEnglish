Hornsby in the Wairarapa election, with somewhere about 1,000 majority, was strong evidence of the decay of Toryism in a district where it had lingered long. This evidence is confirmed by the fact that it is not found worth while to continue the separate existence of the Carterton <i>Observer</i>, hitherto the chief supporter of the rejected squattocrat.
