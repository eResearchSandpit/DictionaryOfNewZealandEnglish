Quote: ... [John Stannage] did do the radio operations on the East-West Atlantic crossing with Smithy in the <i>Southern Cross</i>, at one point flying so close to the sea that his radio signal blacked out when the aerial touched the water! ... He then travelled with Smithy and the <i>Southern Cross</i>, showing her to the people of Australia and New Zealand and became the manager of 'Kingsford Smith Air Services Ltd', a flying school and air taxi business set up by Sir Charles and based in Sydney.
