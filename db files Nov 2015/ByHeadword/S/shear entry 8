Quote: Les always held to the opinion that if you did not get `chipped' at least once a day, you were shearing entirely for the boss. A `chip' meant you were on the borderline and shearing a few for yourself as well. ... He [the critical foreman] failed to show any sense of humour when Les ... replied: `I shore a few for myself that run'.
