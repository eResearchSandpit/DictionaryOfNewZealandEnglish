Quote: The editorial said Southland was not big city sophisticated ... An article identified 32 columns of Macs in the phonebook, and that along with cribs and Sunday roasts on an ashet (big usually oval plate, Scottish, said my OED) proved the kind of place it was. Also you dug potatoes in a shaw (thicket, wood, archaic and poetic: OED).
