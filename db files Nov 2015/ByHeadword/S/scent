Quote: The Europeans in Westland call the adult fish [<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>] `cents' or `scents' and the Maori of Taranaki called them `mingies' (probably a corruption of `minnows').
Notes: [a variant version by Andersen: from R. Mason? : check] The Europeans of the West Coast, South Island, call the adult fish [<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>] `cents' or `scents', whilst the youth of Taranaki District designate them `mingies' - I suppose an evolution from `minnows', by which they are commonly known in many other parts of New Zealand.
