Quote: Though a parent of the Pacific Rose, Splendour's own parents are unknown. All that is known is that it was discovered in New Zealand in 1948 and introduced in 1967. It's not a dramatic looker, being dull pinkish red, and though sweet, with a crisp texture, it is rather mild and lacks tartness.
