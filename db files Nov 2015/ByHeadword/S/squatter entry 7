The word is dropping out of use now being displaced by <i>sheep farmer, station owner </i>, etc. We never had, in Canterbury, the Australian derivatives <i>squattage and squattocracy. </i>

Quote: When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.

Quote:  It was generally agreed that a man needed 1,500 [pounds] to establish himself as a sheep farmer, or `squatter,' as the pastoralists were often called,the term having become repectable and acquired a connotation of wealth, rather than of illegality, as in earlier days in America or Australia.

Quote: <i> Squat&#769;.ter </i>(-t&etilde.r),<i> n. [Add.] 3 </i>. The owner or occupant of a sheep run; a sheep farmer. In Australia the word had at first the sense of a settler without title; but its use was gradually extended to persons who occupied crown land for sheep raising under a lease or a license, and afterwards to those also who held their sheep runs as freehold. Finally the word became the common name for a sheep farmer, whether occupying leasehold or freehold property. It is, however, giving way to the newer term <i> pastoralist </i>.
