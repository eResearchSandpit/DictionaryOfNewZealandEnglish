Quote: The name <i>New Zealand</i> is sometimes wrongly attributed to Tasman himself. He did give it a name, but it was <i>Staten Landt</i>, on the bold hunch that he [sc. Tasman] had come upon the western edge of a vast southern continent whose north-eastern end had (so it was thought) been discovered not long before by other Dutch navigators near the southern tip of South America, and given that name.
