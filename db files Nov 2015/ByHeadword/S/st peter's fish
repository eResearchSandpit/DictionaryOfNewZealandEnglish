Quote: The Red Perch, as is the case with many of our common fishes, has received many popular names. .../ It is also known as the `Red Snapper', `St. Peter's Fish' or `Butterfly Perch' It probably received the name of `St. Peter's Fish' on account of the two black marks, one on each side of the body, which suggest the thumb/and finger marks of St. Peter, as I have previously explained in the case of the John Dory.

Quote: The large circular mark on each side of the body of the John Dory gave rise in earlier days to the tradition that this fish represented the species from which St. Peter obtained tribute money; the spot on either side being regarded as inherited marks left by the Apostle's finger and thumb... Unfortunately for this interesting legend the John Dory does not inhabit the lake whence St. Peter's fish was said to have been taken.
