Quote: The process of fleshing is usually carried out by machines operating a right-and-left spiral knife-cylinder ... flesh side to the knife cylinder. A process similar to fleshing is also carried out in order to remove as much as possible of the hair root-sheaths and fat glands upon the grain side of the pelt. This process is known as `scudding', the skins being fed into the machine, grain side to the knife cylinder.
