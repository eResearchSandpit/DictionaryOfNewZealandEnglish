Quote:  There is a tendency to refer to the game-dentist (and to the real school dentist) in an exaggerated manner. `Here's for the butcher shop', or `I'm off to the horror house', (Waddington [19]49) or `Here's my grave number.' (Forbury), These games are reported mainly by children of mid-primary years.
