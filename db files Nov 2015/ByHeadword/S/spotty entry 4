Quote: Wrasse, parrot-fish, and spotties are often in the market. There are two kinds of spotties, big and little. The Wrasse and Parrotfish are mostly caught outside among the kelp, and with the Spotty are indiscriminately named Kelp-fish by the fishermen, though the term Butterfish is also given to the smaller sorts.
