Quote: <i>The Lemon Sole </i> (Ammotretis rostratus). This fish is popularly known as the lemon sole, to distinguish it from <i>Peltorhamphus novae-zealandiae, Gunther, which the local fishermen call the English sole. The names are somewhat unfortunate, seeing that they are applied to totally different species in Britain.</i>

Quote: Of the remaining species with two pelvic fish, the Lemon Sole (<i>Pelotretis flavilatus </i>) has a normal snout like the Flounder, and a broadly mottled upper surface, with lemon underside. The others have a rounded anterior end caused by an overgrowth of the snout which in the sole (Plate II. fig. 4), often but quite wrongly called the `English' Sole, entirely conceals the mouth from above, while in the last two to be mentioned the mouth is still visible from above.
