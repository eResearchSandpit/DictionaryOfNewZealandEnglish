Quote: It was for a long time believed that a practicable inland communication between the northern end of this island and the country to the southward did not exist, and that the rugged Kaikoras [sic] formed a barrier from the sea on the east coast, to the great chain of Southern Alps which crown the west coast of the island from its northern to its southernmost end.

Quote: The foregoing is the title of an exhaustive paper written by Dr Teichelmann, which appears in the New Zealand Graphic Christmas number, with numerous illustrations from photographs taken by the Doctor on his annual mountaineering trips. The author's purpose is chiefly to show that the approach to the Southern Alps from the West Coast side is through more interesting country than from the Eastern side, and that the route is most accessible.

Quote: IT is not everyone who is privileged to have some portion of the country named after him, but such has been the reward of Arthur Dudley Dobson, civil engineer and pioneer, of Canterbury, after whom Arthur's Pass was named. Mr. Dobson was the first man to traverse the narrow by-pass which gives access from the Canterbury Plains to the narrow productive strip of Westland lying to the west of the Southern Alps.
