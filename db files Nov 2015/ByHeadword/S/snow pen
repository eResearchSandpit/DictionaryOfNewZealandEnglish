Quote: .. on this particular occasion, at Glencoe, we set out to trample a track through the snow for the sheep to follow once we'd freed them from their snow pen. I stayed at the bottom of the snow pen while Brian, the boss, brought them around to the track we'd made about halfway up the side of the pen.
