Quote: There is no such thing now as a stopping dog on the Merino country in the South Island. If the run so described by 'Old Shepherd' was not that of a stopping dog, I would like to hear how your correspondent would improve on it. The silent heading dog is a necessity on rough country. In the old days we called them stopping dogs. Stopping dogs are still an essential on that [high] country.

Quote: Stoppy dog - also called a 'holding dog' .. many high country men had one in their team to corner runaways or hermits. Legend has it that if you forgot to call a good stopping dog off, it would stay on the job till one or other of the parties dropped dead. [stoppy dog]
