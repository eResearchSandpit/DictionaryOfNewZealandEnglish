Quote: When it is added that the bowling is fast and throwing, at which Samoens [sic] are most expert, is allowed, that the bat is shaped like a long and heavy broomstick, tapering from four inches to two, and the ball is made of hard and heavy wood bound with cocoanut fibre, it will be seen that Samoan cricket presents many novel features.

Quote: KILIKITI: Samoan cricket bears about as much resemblance to the ... territory of Lords as the sound of the word does to English. ... For one thing the bat - fashioned in triangular shape from the springy fau tree, decorated in gaudy splashes of colour and bound with coconut fibre - has nothing to do with the sissy wider blade of the willow. It's an out-and-out war club of such bold length ... The ball, spun by hand from liquid rubber tapped from a living tree and compressed to rock-hard consistency, bounds down the pitch with a dangerously unpredictable velocity. ... [T]eams are of indefinite size - 15 a side is considered a minimum for serious competitions... When the batting team reaches 35 runs, to keep the action alive, the teams swop over.
