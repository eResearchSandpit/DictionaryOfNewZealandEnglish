Quote: CATCHFLY (<i>silene [gallica</i>]). Varieties of this species have been named S.anglica and S.quinque vulnera. [1967 quinquevulnera] Common names are spotted catchfly, flycatcher, sticky weed, and five wounds. It is common in cultivated land and waste places such as gravelly river-beds throughout both islands. ... The flowers are white or often dark red, or sometimes white with a blood red blotch on each petal so that this variety is called <i>quinque vulnera</i>, `five wounds'
