Quote: If you're down at the port of Wellington at dusk, look up into the sky for a while. There's every chance you'll see shags flying high into the sky before leaving the port and heading into the sunset .. Because shags usually fly strongly in an unswerving line and are not easily distracted, Maori used to say "me he kawau ka tuku ki roto i te aro maunga (like a shag making for a mountain face)".

Quote: Six kinds of shag fish in Wellington harbour: the big black shag, or common cormorant, which is about the size of a goose, the little black shag, the pied shag, the spotted shag and, recently, a long shag was seen here... Little black shags fish communally. Up to 100 of them form themselves into a ragged line and dive underwater to drive fish toward the sandy beaches around the harbour.
