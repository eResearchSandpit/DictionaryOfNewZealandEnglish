Quote:  ... the brake was of little use to hold us [the horse-wagon] from slipping backward, ... Chocks were useless because they would slip when the weight was applied. As a safeguard, we had fitted to the pole astern a `soldier', which [84] was an iron rod with a sharp parrot beak at the end, dragging on the ground. ... the backward pressure caused the soldier to pierce the surface and so hold the wagon.
