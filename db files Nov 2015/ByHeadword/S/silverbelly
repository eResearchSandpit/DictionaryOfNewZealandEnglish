Quote: There can be no doubt that the so-called broad-nosed eel is the female (local fishermen call it the "glott") and that the sharp-nosed eel is the male, and more popularly known as the "silver-bellied."  Snigs, glotts, brotts, and other distinctive names given by eel-catchers are merely varieties, distinguished by colour and other very slight differences, due, a great deal, to environment; all mean one and the same - Anguilla vulgaris.
