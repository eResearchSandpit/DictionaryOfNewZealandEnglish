Quote: The `snory bones,' as it was called at Moeraki in 1900, was made of a piece of string on to which was threaded a button. The button was moved along to the centre of the string, which was then held in both hands and twirled until the string was sufficiently twisted to be `wound up.' If the string was then suddenly pulled hard, each hand opposing the other, the rotation of the button as to the string unwound would make a strong buzzing sound.
