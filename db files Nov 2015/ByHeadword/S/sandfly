Quote: <i>Simulium </i>? Namu, or sand-fly. <i>Polack,</i> New Zeal., p.319. ... To some insect, of a genus allied to Simulium, is to be referred the New Zealand sand-fly alluded to in the following passage:- `A sort of little crane-flies (<i>tipula alis incumbentibus</i>) became remarkably troublesome during the bad weather. They were numerous in the skirts of the woods, not half so large as gnats or musketoes, and our sailors called them sand-flies. Their sting was extremely painful. . . . All, however, were not equally affected.' Forster, Voyage, ., pp. 135, 136. `The most mischievous animals (at Dusky Bay) are the small black sand-flies, which are very numerous, and so troublesome, that they exceed everything of the kind I ever met with: wherever they bite they cause a swelling ...' Cook, Voyage in Resolution and Adventure, i., p.99.
