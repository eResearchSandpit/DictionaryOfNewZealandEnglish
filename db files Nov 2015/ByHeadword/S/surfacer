Quote: As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfacers,' as they are called, examine the coast-line near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.
