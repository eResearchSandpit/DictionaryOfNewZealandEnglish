Quote: With the advance of civilization, game of all kinds has retreated into the wilds, and once where the swamp turkey abounded and the wild duck loved to feed is now devoid of all game except perhaps in the early morning as the birds are moving to some favoured feeding ground or to the sanctuaries, which are great institutions in their way, as they not only provide the birds with a shelter out of range of their natural enemy and his fowling piece, as well as a breeding ground, but they are responsible for keeping the birds at certain periods in those localities from which ere this they would have migrated, had it not been for the sanctuaries which at the present moment are packed with game seeking security from the sportsman's gun.

Quote: However, in our journeyings let us not forget that not very many years have elapsed since the best known of our many townships, now in telegraphic communication with the metropolis and with each other, and familiar in our mouths as "household words," were in the undisturbed possession of the swamp turkey and wood hen; and let us, in passing, record the leading improvements yearly effected in our rising upland towns, all of which we have known in their "day of small things."
