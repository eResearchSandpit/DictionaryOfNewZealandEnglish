Notes: Jim writes: Sometimes in the form <i>manufacturers' seconds</i>. This sense is recorded in Macquarie 1981 and AMO and has been long familiar to me. [me also - DEH]. The relevant NSOD definition is less specific - "goods of a quality second and inferior to the best." Collins is similar. NZPOD following POD defines seconds as "inferior goods". If British usage accords with these definitions, this sense of the word may be distinctly NZ and AusE.
