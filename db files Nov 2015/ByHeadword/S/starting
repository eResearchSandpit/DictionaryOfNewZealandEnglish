Quote: The stages in milking a cow are named,<i> starting </i>, a few squirts to `get the milk down', <i>changing the cups </i> and <i>stripping </i>. Stripping was the final stage of milking after the cups were taken from the cow. A few extra squirts were obtained by hand, a process now abandoned, as it merely trained cows to withold the last ... bit of milk from the machines.
