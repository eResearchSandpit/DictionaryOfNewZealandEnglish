Quote:  <i> Salmon, n</i> . The English Salmon is being acclimatised with difficulty in Tasmania and New Zealand; the <i>Trout</i>  more successfully. But in all Australian, New Zealand, and Tasmanian waters there is a marine fish which is called Salmon; it is not the true Salmon of the Old World, but <i>Arripis salar</i> , Gunth., and called in New Zealand by the Maori name <i>Kahawai</i> . The fish is often called also <i> Salmon-Trout.</i>  The young is called <i> Samson-fish</i>  (q.v.).
