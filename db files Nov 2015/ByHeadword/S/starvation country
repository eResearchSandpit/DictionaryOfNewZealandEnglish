Quote: There is a lot of bosh and soft-sawder written about the cockies' sons that have left New Zealand, but I would back the above-named for smartness amongst the lot. And why should they make a noise because they want to stay? Their places have been filled, and their absence is not felt as regards labour. It is starvation country, and I wish I was out of it again. - I am, etc., A SWAGMAN.

Quote: Respecting New Zealand being a starvation country, I presume "A Swagsman" [sic] alludes to the starvation wages, and consequent difficulty in obtaining remunerative  employment for unskilled labour, in respect to which anyone long resident in this country cannot but agree with him.
