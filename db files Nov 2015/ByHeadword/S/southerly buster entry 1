Quote: It is curious to watch the battle between the north-west and south-east wind, as we often see it. ... The southerly `burster', as it is called, gradually creeps up, and at last drives the other off the field. A few chilly puffs, then a great one, and in a minute or two the air becomes cold, even in the height of summer.

Quote: Southerly burster, - buster.- <i> Three-day Sou'Wester.</i> A strong wind with rain, snow or sleet from a southerly direction. The ordinary man in the paddock in Canterbury recognises only three winds: east (from NE), sou'-wester (from SE, S etc, SW, etc.) and nor'-wester. As a matter of fact a <i> t.d.sw </i>.' usually only lasts two and a half. They are said to be less fierce than in the early days, just as the <i> nw.</i> is said to have been softened by the planting on the plains. It may be so in Christchurch but I cannot say I notice any difference up country. The <i> nw </i>. may come from any where between due north and due west. In such places as Hororata, where the wind can get at you down two gorges, a distinction is made between a Waimakariri and a Rakaia <i> nw;</i> but both are called <i> nws </i>. `Where six-days a week the gale/ Laden thick with rain or [hail] First from sou'-west blows a piercer/ Then veers nor'-west and blows fiercer.' (C.RH., p. 68.)
