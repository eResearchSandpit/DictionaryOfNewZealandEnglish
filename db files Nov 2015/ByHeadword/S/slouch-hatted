Quote: The boo-hooer [at a football match] may or may not be a hooligan. He may or may not have a slouch hat and bell-bottomed trousers. There was one slouch-hatted boo-hooer who jostled a referee ... at the Athletic Park, Wellington, three years ago. <i>Ibid.</i> 81I was tramping with a mate ... to Westland, and it was our whim to be slouch-hatted, and `blueyed', `billied', unshaven, and otherwise orthodox swaggers.
