Quote: The South Island kokako is said to have been extinct for the past 30 years, although "missing in action" may be a better description as there have been plenty of tantalising clues to suggest that the bird still exists... the South Island kokako is, or was, about the size of a magpie, with steel-grey plumage and distinctive coloured wattles at the base of its beak. It is a distinct subspecies from its North Island neighbour, which has blue wattles and had avoided extinction thanks to a determined effort by the Department of Conservation. Numerous people have reported hearing the southern kokako, with at least one unofficial sighting, in 1996,near the Glenroy River.
