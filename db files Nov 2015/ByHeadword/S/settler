Quote: This variety of mullet [which feeds in the ocean and shoals along the coast] is known to the fishermen and the [Northland] settlers as the `clean-gut', `clean-run', or `sea-mullet'. ... The other variety [which stays in the harbour] is known to the fishermen as the `settler' or muddy fish'. When opened they are not clean and bright ... but full of slimy mud ... <i>Ibid.</i> 7 The fishermen in Kaipara distinguish between `school fish' and `settlers'. ... The `settlers' are those mullet of moderate size which stay in the harbour and run up rivers.
