Quote: <i>Shearer</i>.- One who shears (and while so employed does nothing else). <i>Ss</i>., who always work in company and generally stick to the work for years, meet a great many people and see a great many stations; so they have a great store of expressions connected with their work. Some of them have already been noted (<i>rosella, cobbler</i>, etc.) If two <i>ss</i>. are working out of sight of each other, they can tell one another `where they are' (what part of the sheep they are on) to an inch. A shearer first shears the belly (<i>on the b</i>.), then<i> opens up</i> or goes <i>up the neck</i>, then successively does his <i>first leg, first side, up the back,</i> and so on; finally the last blows trim the <i>last leg</i>, and he is <i>off</i>. But they also use a rhyming slang sometimes among themselves; say,<i> `found a nail'</i> for <i>`round the tail', `hutch'</i> for <i>`crutch',</i> and so on. I have always meant to collect these terms but never have. (C.)
