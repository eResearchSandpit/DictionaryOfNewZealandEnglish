Quote: All freezing was done for the first ten years [from c1882] by the cold air machines ...[66] The carcases were hung in the chambers, and the cold air was blown through kauri ducts or trunks at a temperature of minus 40[degree sign] Fahrenheit. The carcases, being relatively warmer than the air, always lost moisture to it; this formed snow which blocked the trunks, cutting down the air circulation and giving the `snow-men', who had to crawl through the trunks, a bad time in clearing them.
