Quote: [Hdg] The secretive surf clams, the larger shellfish showing its foot is mactra; the smaller is the spisula... The huge mactra surf clam, and the smaller triangular spisula are "new" in the sense that there is no tradition of eating them in New Zealand, despite their being indigenous to our islands.
