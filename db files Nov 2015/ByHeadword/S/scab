Quote: The scab is back. A colleague's 19-year-old daughter tells him the word [is] used by her generation to describe someone who is always borrowing other people's clothes/cigarettes/pens/makeup etc is a scab, and the practice of doing so is scabbing... Scabbing in today's teenage sense seemed closely related to cadging, a form of begging once engaged in by itinerant pedlars known as cadgers.
