Quote: The identity of this bird [hakuwai] is still in doubt. Most of the petrels have been suggested at some stage, including the bird the whalers called the Shoemaker because of the tapping noise it made, but the New Zealand Wildlife Service now believe the <i>hakuwai</i> to be the Stewart Island snipe, thought to be extinct.
