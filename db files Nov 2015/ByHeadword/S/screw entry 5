Quote: `Captain' Scotland personally supervised the stowing [of the wool-cargo] `screwing' the bales into the hold to the singing of sea shanties. The bales were stowed by hand until the last in each row, when `screw-jacks' were used, based on `samson posts', to screw the last bale of the tier into position ..... This method of stowing wool was sometimes referred to as `wool-jamming' or `screwing'
