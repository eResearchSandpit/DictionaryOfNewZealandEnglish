Quote: There was a bad flood in the mine, ... The miners at the face laboured mightily still; they were on a bonus. But the shiftmen, responsible for maintaining `sets' of timber in the mine, grew steadily more shiftless about their work while the truckers ... sat uneasily between the two extremes in alternate bursts of laziness and zeal.
