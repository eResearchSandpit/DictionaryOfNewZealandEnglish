Quote: Smelting, to my mind, requires a light rod - about 9 ft. 6 in. and in the 7 oz. category - ... ibid 172 Then, if the fish are visibly smelting, all should be well. At certain places, and at certain times of the season, one can fish for smelting trout dry-shod from the beach. ... But even with the fish visibly smelting, all is not necessarily plain sailing. There are times when the water can be alive with shoaling smelt and feeding trout, and when even the most cunningly contrived and infallible smelt fly will be completely ignored.
