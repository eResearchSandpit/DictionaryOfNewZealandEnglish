Quote: An expression in common use Down Under is soap the geyser. A crazy one, surely. It is confined almost exclusively to New Zealand, and its origin is no mystery ... In the Thermal Regions of New Zealand there is a particular geyser that could be made to perform by throwing soap into it, and it was frequently soaped so that it would put up a display for the delight of important visitors. So today, when a New Zealander says, `Come on, let's soap the geyser', he means `Come on, let's get going', or `Let's start'

Quote: Complaint is made by a correspondent of the Hot Lakes Chronicle against  the indiscriminate soaping of the great Wairoa Geyser. The correspondent asserts that, in spite of the well-known fact that the geysers of Yellowstone Park, U.S.A., were almost ruined by too frequently soaping them, the authorities at Rotorua permit the great Wairoa Geyser to be soaped so frequently that from playing from an hour to an hour and a half it has deteriorated into a short action of a few minutes.
