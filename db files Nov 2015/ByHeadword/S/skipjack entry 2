Quote: Saw some fish like skip Jacks and a small sort that appear'd very transparent. 5 [fn5] Any sort of fish that had a habit of leaping out of the water tended in the eighteenth century to be called a skipjack. In the twentieth century the name is sometimes given in Australia and New Zealand both to the Striped Tuna (<i>Katsuwonis pelamis</i>) and to more than one sort of Trevally (<i>Usacaranx</i> spp.). Early whalers gave the name to the Trevally. But that does not cast much light on the fish Cook saw, for which other candidates have been suggested, and which must be left unidentifiable.
