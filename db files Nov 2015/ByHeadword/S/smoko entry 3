Quote: `This is no go, and we must give it best! ... I think it's time to cry `Smoke oh' and then we'll go up, for I'm full on this shooting racket.' `You are adept at slang, Arthur, and no mistake', ... `And yet a fellow told me the other day, he could tell at once that I had not been long in the country, or, as he phrased it, `that I had not got the lime-juice out of me yet;' so it can't be colonial slang that I speak.' Well, I don't know that colonials are worse than other people for speaking slang, but they have, of course, many words and phrases peculiar to themselves.'
