Quote: THE DEPOSITION OF GOLD IN RIVERS indicates that the metal must have been native to its banks, and washed down to lower levels as the rivers deepened their beds. In proof of this it may be mentioned that had the gold been fed into the watercourses at their heads the heavier gold would be found in its upper portions, the lighter and finer gold lower down the stream, and that the very fine gold had travelled the greatest distance; and such is found to be the case in all artificial sluices and tail races.
