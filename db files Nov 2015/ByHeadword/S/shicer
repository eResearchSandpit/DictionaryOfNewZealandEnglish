Quote: Events proved that the alleged quarry was a shicer;  stone that the contractor's bosses thought "good" was ruthlessly condemned by the alleged expert inspector for the Government, and after vainly trying to keep up adequate supplies and satisfy the hammer expert, Mr Powell succeeded, with the aid of "Truth," which exposed the real strength of that wonderful "quarry," in getting clear of his responsibilities.

Quote: [Colonial slang] If a man isn't `up to the mark' he is called `a regular shicer!' This phrase originated from the gold diggings. Supposing a man is digging, but without success, and he therefore abandons his hole, it is called a `shicer' - that is, the <i>ground</i> was called a `shicer' or duffer, thus the origin

Quote: DUFFER: applied to a rush, a shaft, or a claim generally. A failure. Synonyms were `shicer', `stringer' or, in the case of a false rush, `store-keepers' rush'. A claim which was exhausted was said to be `duffered out'. At Ross in 1866 putting down a duffer shaft was termed `sinking for the Queen'. Duffers (Creek) is a common West Coast place-name.

Quote: <i>Miners' Expressions:</i> ... There are many words and phrases current peculiar to the mining population ... Besides [technical expressions] there are words used in general conversation which would not be found in an English dictionary. Such, for example, as `duffer' or `shiser', anything that is useless.
