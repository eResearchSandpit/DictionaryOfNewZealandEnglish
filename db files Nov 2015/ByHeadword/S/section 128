Notes: Section 128 of the Act (1955, 1903 and previous) does NOT deal with winding up. The section 128 that does appear to deal with this (Every Director of the Company shall be indemnified by the company... is Section 128 of the Second Schedule of 1903 Act (re-check this). It does not use the word winding up and is somewhat lengthy.
