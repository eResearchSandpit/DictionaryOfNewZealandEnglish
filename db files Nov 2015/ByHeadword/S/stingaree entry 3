Quote: This was about the time when she was bitten by a katipo spider. The katipo, a tiny black spider with a red spot on his back, is almost the only poisonous thing in the country, though the boys called the rose and indigo blobs of jelly washed in with the tides at Lyall Bay [Wellington] `stingarees', and said that once a little girl was stung to death by them.
