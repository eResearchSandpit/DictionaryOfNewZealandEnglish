Notes: aka square-face; 1989 TASKER Old NZ Bottles & Bygones 48 : When you bring up the subject of gin bottles with a collector he or she immediately thinks of the traditional Dutch shape - an attractive square-sided bottle slightly tapering off towards the base... These.. have retained the same basic shape since they were first made about 1650... They were specifically made to be packed into cases for export.

Quote: It is not quite certain, at least in the police court, what one should call the bottles which are usually requisitioned for the gentle duty of `running the cutter.' A good old-fashioned name is a `square-face,' but in the court the other day `square rigger' was the term used as a proper legal description of the article, while counsel went so far as to call it a `square-rigged bottle.' What's in a name? A J.D.K.Z. bottle will always hold the regulation sixpence worth no matter what it's called.
