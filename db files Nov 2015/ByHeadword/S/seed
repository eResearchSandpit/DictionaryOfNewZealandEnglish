Quote: ... it is no doubt also responsible for the dark coloured varnishes produced from the chip grades. [fn] The terms dust, seeds, chips, nubs, &c., are the names given to certain of the lower kauri gum grades according to the relative sizes of the pieces. From `dust' the size of the fragments increases in the order given, as does also the purity of the grade. Chalk, or `chalky gum,' is a particular grade recovered from swampy country and is characterized by its white or chalky appearance and large water content.
