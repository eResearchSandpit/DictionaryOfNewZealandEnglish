Quote: One of the sweetest moments of Smith's career was when her fiance.. welcomed her to the fraternity of slappers... The role of a slap-hitter is to put the ball in a spot on the diamond that is hard to defend... A slapper faces the pitcher left-handed, so their natural momentum carries them towards first base and cuts valuable seconds off the 18m journey.
