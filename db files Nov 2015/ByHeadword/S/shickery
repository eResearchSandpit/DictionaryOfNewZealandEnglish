Quote: At noon the boats were ready, but the breakers were too high and the weather too boisterous to venture to hoist them out; and the long boat being very shickery, I made up my mind to venture through the Feejee Group, and get to Vewa to the Wesleyan Mission Station, with the expectation of meeting the 'John Wesley,' or some other vessel.

Quote: Magistrate McArthur, last Tuesday morning, roundly rated an individual named Allbright for having put the police to the trouble of arresting his own companion for the alleged paltry theft of a foul pipe and a bit of tobacco. Why didn't the magistrate rate the police also, who acted on Allbright's shickery charge? Their fondness for cases and convictions obsesses whatever good sense they possess and a spirit of fair play is unknown in many of their overgrown carcases.
