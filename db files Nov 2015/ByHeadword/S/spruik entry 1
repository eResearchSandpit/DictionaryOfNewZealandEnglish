Quote: To do my job properly, I had to pick up the meaning of spruik along with such things as the subtle differences between a galah, a ning nong and a nong. Mostly, it came up as the noun spruiker, a loud talker advertising snake oil or aggressively pushing some line at a meeting. Australians use spruiker as Americans use spieler and huckster, as a sort of alternative to spin doctor. It is also occasionally heard in New Zealand.
