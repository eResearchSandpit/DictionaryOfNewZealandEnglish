Quote: No good shearer makes second cuts; the fact that the wool has been left by the first cut proves that the shears have not been handled properly, and the wool thus removed by a second cut is perfectly useless, entails a loss on the manufacturer, and lowers the brand in the market.

Quote: <i>second cut</i>: This results when the shears are allowed to move off the sheep's skin and so into the fleece, making another blow necessary. Second cuts spoil the fleece and are said to cost the wool industry millions of dollars a year. This is because the second cut of prime wool is downgraded to the price of locks, and the main fleece brings a lower price because of its uneven staple length.
