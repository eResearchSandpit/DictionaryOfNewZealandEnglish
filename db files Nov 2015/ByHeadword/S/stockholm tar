Notes: Jim writes: DNZE has an entry for this, as recorded earliest in NZ and "significant esp. in farming uses." NSOD notes its used in shipbuilding and ointments. It was also much used in NZ (also called <i>hot tar</i> - not in DNZE or NSOD) as a preservative and colouring treatment for shingles and other timber.
