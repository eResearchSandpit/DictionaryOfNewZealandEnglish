Quote: Thus <i>snib</i> exists both as noun and as verb. The little lever on the lock is described as the 'snib', and 'snibbed' is used to describe the state of the lock. To 'snib the door' means to set the lever to lock it; to 'snib it open' means to set the lever to make it unlocked.

Quote: <i>Snib</i> is alive and well in Australia, where it keeps doors closed securely. It can be used as a noun referring to the mechanism which works only from one side of a door in a Yale-type lock and fixes the door closed, or to a latch; and as a verb meaning to engage the mechanism or latch.
