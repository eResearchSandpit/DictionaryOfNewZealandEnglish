Quote: There are at this moment, many large tracts of land, leased, which are lying, for all purposes of reproductiveness, utterly valueless; in fact, to use an old Victorian expression, being `shepherded', the lesses of which, are Micawber-like, `waiting for something to turn up' in their neighbourhood, before they turn to with a will and work the ground
