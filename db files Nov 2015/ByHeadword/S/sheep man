Quote: To drive sheep against the wind is absolutely impossible .. If a storm comes up they all move 'down wind,' until stopped by a fence. Then begins the proceeding so much dreaded by sheepmen, known as 'piling.'

Quote: There is a danger of all writers about the old days using modern terms which were not used in the period they are writing about. .... But some older writers make some surprising slips, and a really noticeable instance is in the inscription in the porch of the Memorial Church at Cave, South Canterbury, which reads: `This porch is erected to the glory of God in memory of the sheep-men, shepherds, bullock-drivers, shearers, and station-hands who pioneered the back-country of this province between the years 1855 and 1895' When I first read this inscription, the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., flock-owners, flock masters, pastoralists, run holders, run owners, sheep owners, sheep holders, sheep masters, squatters, station holders, station owners, stock holders and stock owners. The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial ..... Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `run holder' was the most used.
