Notes: Kolstad says these are species of <i>Gaultheria</i> and snow-apple in this sense does not appear to occur elsewhere, only in OED2 and US Dictionaries as an apple cultivar. Kerry Carman writes (Sep. 2000): I can supply no other literary reference to snow apples but am sure Neave was referring to the Alpine Snowberry <i>Gaultheria depressa</i> or, more likely, the closely-related <i>G.d.</i> var <i>novae-zelandiae</i> (Mountain Snowberry) with pure white apple-shaped fruits. These, at 1.5 cm, are the largest and juiciest berries in the genus.

Quote: It is certain that snow-apple is a colloquial colonial term for the plant we now refer to as snowberry - possibly the Bush Snowberry <i>Gaultheria antipoda</i>, which is common on Mt Somers. But more likely, from Naeve's description of the fruit, is the Alpine Snowberry <i>Gaultheria depressa</i>, or the closely related <i>G d novaezelandiae</i>, the Mountain Snowberry, distinguished by its pure white, apple-shaped fruits, which, at 1.5 cm, are the largest, juiciest and generally regarded as tastiest in the genus.

Quote: "We were up at 7.30 o'clock, took some sandwiches and started off to climb Mt Somers. Walked through bush and scrub and over stones, shifting shingle and boulders. Ate any amount of snow-apples, little white berries growing like cranberries and tasting like apples and cream".
