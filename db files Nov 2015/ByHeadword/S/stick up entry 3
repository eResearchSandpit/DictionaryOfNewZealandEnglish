Notes: (1) The regular word for the action of bush-rangers stopping passers-by on the highway and robbing them.(2) In the case of a bank or a station, simply to rob. [1846] (3) Humorously applied to a collector or a beggar. In `Twenty - five Years of St. Andrews' (vol. ii. p. 87), A. K. H. B. tells a story of a church dignitary, who was always collecting money for church building. When a ghost appeared at Glamis Castle, addressing the ghost, the clergyman began - that `he was most anxious to raise money for a church he was erecting; that he had a bad cold and could not well get out of bed; but that his collecting-book was on the dressing-table, and he would be `extremely obliged' for a subscription.' An Australian would have said he `stuck up' the ghost for a subscription. [1890]
