Quote: The sticking-pen far below me down the tunnelled slope from the top of the ramp. From there comes the pained lowing of goaded cattle and the sharp crack of the lethal hammer wielded by the nonchalant bloke leaning over his platform above the trapped beast. <i>Ibid.</i> 67 I'd like to see them ... racing the chain, that remorseless heartless chain. And when the last is scrubbed and the chain is switched off, going down for a shower ... I'd like to see them on the chain. Even the learners' chain. In that narrow cell of concrete with the lambs swinging in quick time up the ramp from the sticking-pen ... Lambs hooked on to the chain and progressing slowly along while the row of men standing alongside slash and tear and nick with knives while others punch briskets or pull the skins from the swinging carcases. More men rip out the guts and throw the heart and liver on to the small-goods table ... and the skins and innards and hooves and ears all go by chutes to the departments below. <i>Ibid.</i> 227 The tourists ... never see the dogs running over the backs of the sheep jammed in the saleyards or the pet sheep leading them slyly up the ramp into the sticking pen at the works ...
