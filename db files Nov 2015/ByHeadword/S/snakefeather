Quote: A pretty climbing weed is getting a name change to help people recognise and get rid of it. Wellington Regional Council staff were finding climbing asparagus, a South African ornamental plant, wild in gardens and native bush around Wellington... "Snakefeather" is better described as Asparagus scandens, which snaked around saplings, and eventually grew into a 3m-high "solid green fog".

Quote: Wellington Regional Council is urging the public to help eradicate snakefeather, also known as climbing asparagus, which is threatening native bush from Tawa to Karori... The pest is called snakefeather because its vine snakes its way up other plants and its leaves look like feathers.
