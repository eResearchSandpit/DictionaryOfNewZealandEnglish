Quote: In the dusk, the boys could take a moment to snatch a wood pigeon or hunt down a sqawking pukeko dancing off for the safety of the swamp. Added to the pot with some rice and salt and a leaf or two of cabbage, bargained for in passing a homestead, the Templetons became adept at 'souping.' William always remembered the magic of that settlers' 'burgoo' of a dish.
