Quote: Ball-bouncing games have come into their own on the asphalt playgrounds of modern schools and are played in many schools throughout the country. There is no evidence of such games before 1900, but a number of instances between 1900 and 1920 are recorded. The games were known as Fives, Tens, Sevens, and Walls and have been recorded more often since under the names O'Leary or Sevens. Before 1920 there is only one report of the game being played with a rhyme, and this was a rhyme more often used in skipping.
