Quote: SNOWED IN. Describing the state of affairs when the shearers are ahead of the wool table, so that wool is lying around the floor waiting to go on the wool table. With a good run shearers can sometimes snow the pressers in. Shearers will be seen at their best when they get ahead of the rest of the shed. They enjoy this snowing in, and usually they make the wool flow faster than ever.
