Quote:  [`Leaves from a (wharf) loafer's journal'] My dingy acquaintance [on the wharves] chuckles mockingly as he replies `Not so bad for you, old un, though your young at the profession yet. I twigged you on your speeling lay [fn. `card sharping'] this afternoon whilst I was gattering my clay. [fn. `drinking beer']
