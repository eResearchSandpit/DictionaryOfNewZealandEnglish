Quote: Powell described how whitebait kept in ponds grew into "smelts". However, what these smelts were, Powell could not say since he believed that "two very distinct fish [were] confounded together under the name of smelts".

Quote: Whitebait in pristine condition are beautiful... There are local names for them, too - elephant ears and Don Doolin 'bait (which isn't true whitebait at all), and cucumbers (which are actually smelt, Retropinna retropinna, or paraki).

Quote: There are only three fish in the River Avon, sufficiently common to justify the supposition that either of them may be the adult form of the Whitebait; these are the Bull-head, the Silver-fish, and the Smelt. The name of Smelt is applied indiscriminately to the two latter fish, we will ... retain the trivial name of Silver-fish as a distinction. We may first dismiss the Bull-head ... It is an Acanthopterygious fish ... Head, large, one third of the length of the body ... [86] The Silver-fish again belongs to the <i>Malacopterygii abdominales </i>, or fishes having soft fin rays, with the ventral fins placed below the abdomen. ... We now come to the ... fish ...called, by boys, the Smelt; but why a Smelt, I know not. ... the Smelt is a Galaxia ...

Quote: SMELT A common little fish often confused with - and caught with - whitebait. He is the bitter, silver fellow the sharp-eyed whitebaiter discards from his nets. Smells like cucumber, hence one of his other names Cucumber-fish. Also called Silvery. ... Several types of smelt occur around New Zealand - Canterbury, Chatham Islands, Rotorua, Sea Foam, Southland and Stokell's - but it takes a real expert to tell them apart. <i>Ibid.</i> 288 SECOND-CLASS WHITEBAIT These are the young of the smelt (<i>Retropinna retropinna </i>) which are caught from wharves mainly - especially Auckland's Devonport Wharf - and sold as whitebait. There are no regulations governing them as they are not regarded as being `true' whitebait.

Quote: <i>Vernacular Name </i>.- Powell [TrNZI 2/84] was the first to point out that two fish were referred to as `smelt' in north Canterbury. These were <i>Galaxias attenuatus </i> and <i>Retropinna retropinna </i>. At present Canterbury residents refer to <i>R. retropinna </i> as `silvery,' on account of the silver line running along the side of the half-grown fish. Maoris refer to this `silvery' as `tikihemi,' and to the adult as `paraki.'

Quote: Unfortunately he called the adult [whitebait Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. 2, pp.84 to 87, 1870] by the name of `smelt, Galaxias fasciatus'; but his three figures undoubtedly illustrate three stages of growth of the fish, Galaxias attenuatus. <i>Ibid.</i> 54 In some other localities these young [smelt, <i>Retropinna </i>] are called tuarenga. The half-grown fish is termed tikihemi and the adult paraki. Certain races of fish have a broad silvery band running along the side; hence the term `silvery.' It is to be regretted that in Canterbury the term smelt is still used to apply to the minnow, <i>Galaxias attenuatus.</i>
