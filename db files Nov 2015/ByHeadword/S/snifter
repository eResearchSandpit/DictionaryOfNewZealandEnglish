Quote: I have no fond memories of the Snifter, which I have always regarded as the confectionery of oppression. I could bear the Jaffas, which bounced off my skull with a harmless "doik doik" sound, but being strafed by Snifters was like being peppered with buckshot.

Quote: The cry has gone up in protest against Cadbury Schweppes' decision to stop making the green lolly and its two cousins, Tangy Fruits and Sparklers [sic]. Some Web readers smelled a rat in the death of the Snifter, and wondered if Cadbury was using the sweets to drum up publicity.

Quote: Snifters are a Kiwi Icon. Right up there with L&P! Save the snifter. Hearing they were on the way out I went hunting for a bag or two. Sold out .. The snifter eaters need to arise and unite to bring back the snifter.

Quote: It's a fortnight since Cadbury Schweppes confirmed its company Pascalls was no longer manufacturing Snifters, Sparkles and Tangy Fruits and the backlash has gone global. Slater, 32, said getting rid of the Snifter was about as bad as it got. "Maybe even worse than doing away with pavlova, custard squares, whitebait fritters or roast lamb. We're a country that loves the oval ball: the rugby ball, the league ball, and the lime green ball - the Snifter."
