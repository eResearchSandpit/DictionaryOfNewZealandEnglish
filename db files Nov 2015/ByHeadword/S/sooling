Quote: Although inadvertently administered, Angus had been under the influence of `sool,' which gave him an unfair advantage over an enemy who was, for the moment, peaceably inclined. Bill had been the victim of an illegal attack. The New Zealand Standards Institute doesn't mention the word `sool' in its code of by-laws. Perhaps it is too simple. Officialdom does things the hard way. `It is to be forbidden,' says the Institute, `in any public place, to set on, urge, encourage, aid or assist any dog to rush at, attack or worry any person or animal.' This would seem to include baiting, egging, sooling and/or sic-ing, though not specifically mentioned.
