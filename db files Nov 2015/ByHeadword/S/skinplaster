Quote:  The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as <i>assignats</i>, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. <i>Assignats</i> was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.
