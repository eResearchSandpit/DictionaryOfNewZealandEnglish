Quote: I have never raised a dog that was not a worker, or was beaten by what we term a 'Sunday dog' - 'a cool day and a short journey.' It does not pay a shepherd to keep them.

Quote: Another is the 'Sunday dog,' a deeply religious animal which treats everyday as the Sabbath and therefore, won't work. Not everyone accepts that definition. Some Southerners believe that a Sunday dog is a very biddable creature which, even when spoken to quietly does as it's told - first time and with no further fuss. These attributes remove the need for shouting and anger, which make such a dog the ideal mate for working on the Sunday morning following a rugged Saturday night.
