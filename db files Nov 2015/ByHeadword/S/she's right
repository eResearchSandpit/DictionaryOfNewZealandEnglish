Quote: Sir, - I read `The Dominion's' second editorial of Jauary 25, `Our `She'll-Be-Right' Attitude,' with interest, but as a Grim Dig I feel that it is my duty to point out to the younger generation the origin and meaning of the expression `she's right' `She's right' or `She'll-Be- Right' originated in the Army and was only used when the person using the saying was satisfied that he had done his particular job to the best of his ability and took pride in it. If, on the other hand, he had done the job to the best of his ability but he was not satisfied with the job, he used the phrase `She's not too good' or `She's pretty poor' Never was the phrase `She's right' used in the sense that politicians and various other people not in the know use it to refer to a job badly done or done with a `couldn't-care-less' attitude. This was never necessary because in the Army we had other phrases to cover such contingencies when things did not go according to plan, such as NAFU and SAFU, the first being a non-adjusting fiasco, and the second being a self-adjusting fiasco. To say the least of it, I feel strongly that it is disrespectful to the originators of the saying `She's right' to use it in the present accepted sense, and I feel also that all Grim Digs should rise up in righteous wrath, but `don't do your scone boys.' Belmont. INFANTEER.
