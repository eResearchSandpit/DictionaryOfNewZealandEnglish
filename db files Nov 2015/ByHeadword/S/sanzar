Quote: Worse for Sanzar as it looks to promote itself as the premier rugby product in the southern hemisphere, 200,000 more viewers watched Australia play England last June than the Bledisloe Cup in July... The other point raised by the Australian ratings is how attractive to viewers is Sanzar's touted tinkering of the Tri Nations and the adding of two teams to the Super 12 - one of them Australian?
