Quote: TUNAS ... Tuna were generally known as `tunny' until the discovery of a potentially big export market to America, where tuna is rated a luxury fish. The name as then changed to conform with that used in America. Since then Southern Bluefin tuna, Yellowfin tuna and Striped, or Skipjack, tuna have been developed into important export fishes. In New Zealand the Albacore has become an important commercial fish. <i>Ibid.</i> 267 BONITO Offshore anglers use bonito fillets for snapper bait and deep-sea anglers claim its dark-red flesh attracts almost every sporting fish up to shark and marlin. It is known as Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Skippy, Skipper and Skipjack because of its habit of breaking the surface when feeding. The name `Skipjack' has also been applied however to at least half-a-dozen other species.
