Quote: There are shanties and shanties. It is necessary to explain. Primarily, in its Canadian and original sense, the term means a log-house - a hut made of rough squared logs, built up upon each other. Such log-huts are not common in this country, though they may be seen here and there. ... The native whare[e-grave] of thatch is quickly and easily raised, serves all requirements, and lasts for years ... A shanty here, is a name applied to almost any kind of nondescript erection, which would not come under the designation of [117] whare[e-grave], or be honoured by the ambitious title of house. Rough edifices of planking are the common form. a hut (cf <i>built a warre </i>Jan 6)

Quote: He [the pioneer pastoralist] has built a domicile of some sort, be it of canvas, calico, bagging, sticks, ferntrees, grass, slabs, mud, clay, stone, or wattle and daub. He may call it various names according to its materials, but three names would not enter his head - i.e., crib, bach, or shack. He may call it a cabin, a shanty, a cottage, a warrie [whare], but probably he would use the commonest term of all - hut.
