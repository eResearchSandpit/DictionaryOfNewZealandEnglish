Quote: If a race has to be halted, the simplest way to hold it is to lock the wheels on one of the boxes. This is done by inserting a short sword-like piece of steel into the wheel-spokes. Once again, the north-of-England dialect comes into play and the piece of steel is known as a <i>sprag </i>. Its smaller brother, the <i>sprig </i> (though it has acquired a new meaning on the football field), was originally a short headless nail, a <i>sprig </i> being essentially a smaller <i>sprag.</i>
