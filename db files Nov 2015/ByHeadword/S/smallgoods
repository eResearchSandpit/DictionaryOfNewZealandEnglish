Quote: One of the outstanding changes in the New Zealand frozen-meat industry ... is the development of a valuable export trade in certain edible by-products (livers, kidneys, hearts, and sweetbreads). With the exception of the kidneys, these organs were formerly discarded as `offals' ... When compared on a basis of relative weights, their value is often higher than that of the meat itself. ... Even when low prices prevail for animal products, the market for these `small-goods' is usually a profitable one.
