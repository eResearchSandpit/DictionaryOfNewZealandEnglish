Quote: Another beautiful tree fern that grows lustily throughout the Dominion is the `Ponga,' or `Silver King,' known to botanists as <i>Cyathea dealbata</i>. It is extremely easy to identify, because the backs of the fronds are always pure white, while the stems are a warm nut-brown colour. It is not so large as the mamaku, reaching a maximum of twenty feet in height, while its fronds are never more than twelve feet long.
