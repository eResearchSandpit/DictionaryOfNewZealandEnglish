Quote: Not so long ago, when retired folks thought of taking an overseas trip they looked somewhat guilty and joked they planned a SKI holiday; they were Spending their Kids' Inheritance. These days there seems to be an additional sense of urgency when the older generation indulge themselves. They now say SKIN: Spending their Kids' Inheritance Now... "I'm off on a SKIN holiday to Italy" he said.
