Quote: Spraydrift from 2,4-D butyl ester, our most widely used weedkiller, has been blamed for health problems ranging from cancer to headaches... Before his death, Foley had put forward a paper that reflected the industry's view of 2,4-D - that is, that volatile spraydrift was causing no problems and there was no need to get rid of it.
