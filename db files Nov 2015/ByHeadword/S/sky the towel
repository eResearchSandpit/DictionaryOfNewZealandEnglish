Quote: Mafish.- Sam Slang remarks; It is well known how the Turkish word `mafish' is commonly used now in place of old slang, such as `gone a million,' `blown out,' `snuffed it,' `clenched his fist,' `crashed in,' `handed in his checks,' `took the count,' `skied the towel,' etc.

Quote: GONE WEST. [headline] Mr. A.H. Logan. On Wednesday night last [13 August 1931] ... Logan sailed to that mystic land beyond the setting sun to await - The Morn! The passing of Mr. Logan removes ... one of the grim determined type, who although a sufferer for many years never `skied the towel', ... and who ... literally died in harness at the age of 75 years [at Kaitaia].
