Quote: "Seekers" of [medical] treatment are told that they will be "scored" using "Clinical Priority Assessment Criteria", or CPAC, pronounced "see-pack", the HFA [Health Funding Authority] says cutely. (Can't you just see some expensive PR consultants dreaming up this term so they can get down to the dim-witted level of the public?)"See-packing" may happen when a seeker is seen by a specialist... Seekers can be "see-packed" by some anonymous person, who, in their absence, simply peruses their medical records.Seekers are not necessarily told their see-pack score... What a pity that no see-packed seekers of treatment are included on the programme at the London conference.
