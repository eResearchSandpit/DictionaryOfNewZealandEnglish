Quote: SHEPHERDING: holding possession of a claim without working on it, or by doing the minimum amount of work necessary to satisfy the regulations and the warden. Shepherding was common on a new rush. Old timers often pegged out a claim and waited to see what success their more anxious neighbours had - especially where deep shafts or log tunnels were necessary to reach the lead.
