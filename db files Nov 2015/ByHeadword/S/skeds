Quote: Twice each day the operators at the [Chatham Island] radio station called all the back-country people, relying messages, world news and local news, taking messages and orders for stores and answering queries. If you didn't possess a set you could still listen in on the `skeds' by tuning into the appropriate band on an ordinary radio. ... During an evening schedule George was up at the radio station talking to an old man on the other side of the island.
