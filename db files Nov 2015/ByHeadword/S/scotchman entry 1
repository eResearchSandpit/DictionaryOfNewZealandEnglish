Quote: As we neared the hills speargrass of the smaller kind, known as `Scotchmen', abounded, and although not so strong and sharp-pointed as the `Spaniard', would not have made a comfortable seat.

Quote: National appellations are not satisfactory. It seems uncivil to a whole nation - another injustice to Ireland - to call a bramble a wild Irishman, or a pointed grass, with the edges very sharp and the point like a bayonet, a Spaniard. One could not but be amused to find the name Scotchman applied to a smaller kind of Spaniard.
