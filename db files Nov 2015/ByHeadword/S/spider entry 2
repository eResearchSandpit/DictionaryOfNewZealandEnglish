Notes: Jim Cameron writes: This is in NZD but not DNZE. NSOD gives it as "= float", with similar meaning, but tags it in this sense as <i>Austral. slang</i>. The drink was well-known to young people from the 1940s at least until the 80s. DEH adds that <i>float</i> was also known to him from the 40s - I seem to remember it from the infamous Elbe's milkbar in Lower Hutt
