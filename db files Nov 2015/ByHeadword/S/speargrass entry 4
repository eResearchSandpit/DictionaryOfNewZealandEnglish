Quote: Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: The larger species [of <i>Aciphylla</i>] are familiar to the settlers as `Spear-grass', or `Bayonette-grass', `Wild' or `Bloody-Spaniard', [<i>bloody </i>=?] in allusion to their very rigid, strong, poniard-like, sharp-pointed leaves ... Hence a `Spear-grass Scrub' on the hill ranges is frequently most formidable ... to men and horses, though it forms one of the favourite hunting grounds of the Wild Pig. In the Matukituki Valley, `Bayonette-grass' forms an undergrowth in a dense scrub of prickly thorn ...
