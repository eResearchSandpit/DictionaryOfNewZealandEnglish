Notes: Jim Cameron writes: This has the same meaning as <i>flag day</i>, recorded in OED, NSOD amd Collins. Flag day may be used in NZ also and <i>street day</i> may be a local usage. Street days have been familiar to me in Wellington since the 1940s. Not in OED DEH notes that to the best of his knowledge he has never heard flag day used in NZ except in English books (and comics) - always <i>street days</i> or <i>street appeals</i> or <i>street appeal days</i>
