Quote: Shaking dogs enforce law and order in a team, but the percentage of good catching dogs to poor ones is lamentably low. Half-pie shaking dogs only cause the offender to become more stupid. I remember one chap who would put his other dogs on to his best dog, even though he'd done nothing wrong, because that was the only dog they would hold.
