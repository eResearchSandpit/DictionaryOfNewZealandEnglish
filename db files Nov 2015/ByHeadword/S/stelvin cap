Quote: ...dozens of New Zealand journalists were told that the special design of stelvin caps ensured that the possibility of oxidation had been eliminated... For [some writers] stelvinism has become a fanatical religion akin to supporting the All Blacks.... So don't feel any more inhibited about sending a stelvin bottled wine back for exchange or refund, than you would a corked wine.
