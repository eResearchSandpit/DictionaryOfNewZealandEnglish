Quote: It is important to distinguish these `Action-Terms' of marbles from the innumerable merely descriptive marble terms which have no effect on the course of the action - terms such as Ringer, In, Smug, Dead Stick, Skun, Skinned, Sported off, Scat, Cannons, Dubs, Kills, Funs, Keeps, Pink.

Quote: Some of the typical terms used in marbles referred to the act of shooting and the movement of the marbles. Those related to ways of shooting marbles were cribbing, firsts, fudging, funks, funnicks, funnigans, flunks, forces, knee-high, knuckle-down-stiff, knuckles, and lasts. Terms connected with the movement of the marbles were: cannons, clears, dead-stick, double-hits, fires, funs, gees, haystacks, in smug, keeps, kills, kisses, lay-ups, manyes, ones, pink, ringer, rolls, scat, screws, skinned, skun, spiders, sported-off, stays, stops, tracks, throughs. (marbles) <i>Ibid.</i> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899: reference, game of Little Ring] Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.
