Quote:  ... fishing was to be taken seriously [in Southland c1900]. The lads spent the evening hours `snoozing' hooks; that is, fastening to them short lengths of flax-fibre string, lighter than the line; the idea being that if a hook becomes fast on anything in the sea the fisherman will lose the hook and not the line.
