The representatives of the former genus, however, though common in England, appear to be rare in these seas, while the half-beak, which is of rare occurrence in the British seas, is common all round New Zealand, and is the ordinary gar-fish that is so highly appreciated, especially in Auckland and Dunedin. <i>Ibid.</i>305 <i>Scombresox Forsteri </i> C. and V.
