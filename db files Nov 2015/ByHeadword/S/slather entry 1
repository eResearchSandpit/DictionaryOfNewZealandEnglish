Quote: [In the last round they both tired visibly, and casting caution to the winds slathered each other.] ... A wild slather ended when Finnie missed with a left and came in with his head low, owing to the impetus. ... Early in the round, Bennetts emerged from a slather, shaking his head and seemed to forget all about his opponent.

Quote: Then both warriors made a speech, which was lost amid the roar. It was a great slather and whack fight. There is no gainsaying Grim's pluck and ability to take punishment. But there is a big chunk of his reputation gone now that Griffin dropped him.

Quote: Chris. Rusterholz (8.5) versus Cliff Pearce (7.12). This was the tit-bit of the evening and provided five rounds of ding dong slather of a high order. Both are quick two-handed fighters and they went at it hammer and tacks without a dull moment intervening.

Quote: The feathers, J. Whittome (8.7) and C. McCarthy (8.5), followed, and they gave a clean, clever exhibition, more like a professional bout than that of amateurs. There was none of that wild slather, but good, scientific punching throughout.

Quote: Seldom indeed has a crowd voiced its approval of an out-and-out boxing match as it did at Wellington last week. Scientific stuff nine times out of ten leaves the audience cold - it is the slather and whack artists that get 'em on their feet, yelling encouragement. But the exception was bumped into last week when Jack Carroll gained a points decision over Charlie Purdy. Carroll came to us with a reputation of a bit of a killer, but his first fight in Wellington showed he was more of a stylist. He showed up as a nice mover, possessing plenty of speed at both ends, but totally lacking as a purveyor of hefty wallops.

Quote: BOXING AT GREYMOUTH. ...Now, when the time is ripe, it might be mentioned that Cook's exhibition throughout the mill, his genuine smile of good fellowship when picking up his opponent on a couple of occasions when he slipped, and his palpable desire to box instead of indulging in 'slather and whack', bears the impression that when his recent mill with Billy Hannan at Gisborne was declared 'no fight' and he lost his share of the purse, there was some truth in his words, 'I don't profess to be a fighter; I'm a boxer, pure and simple, and I tried my hardest to beat Hannan.'
