Quote: [On Lieutenant Shortland's show of official force to Wellington colonists, 18--] `You may easily imagine how disappointed I was that the [Wellington] Council did not shew [sic] fight. It would have been such a spree to have blown up their magazine and besides that I should have been entitled to ?10 and 9d. per diem tentage and forage money for actual service and should also have had the pleasure of licking them, instead of which no sooner did we appear than they all sneaked off.'

Quote: English people are given to associating the idea of a `spree' with that of a bacchanal orgy. Not so We. With us the word is simply colonial for a festivity of any kind, public or private. And whatever may be the primary object of a spree, it is pretty certain to end with a dance.
