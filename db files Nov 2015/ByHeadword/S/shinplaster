Quote: Depend upon it, fellow colonists, if they could not keep their mercurial fingers off the sacred fund of the widows and orphans, they will have small respect for those provisions of the Colonial Ordinance which professedly provide a security for the payment of the shin plasters.

Quote: Many tradesmen [in the early 1840s] had to make their own money on strips of paper called by the settlers `shin plaisters'. Governor Grey [sic] established a bank issue and issued one pound promisery [sic] notes, to get change for one of these, you would get a hat full of shin plaisters.

Quote: I do not know exactly how wholesale mercantile business was carried on, but the retail business in the town [?Wellington] was carried on [c1840s] mostly by means of little bits of printed paper, issued by shopkeepers, for from one penny to two or three shillings. This currency went by the general name of `shin plaster'. <i>Ibid.</i> 117 When eggs fell from six silver shillings per dozen to one shilling of `shin plasters', the Hutt, Porirua Road and Karori settlers looked anxious.

Quote: <i>Shinplasters</i>.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' <i>vide "The Australian," </i>19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 <i>The Numismatist,</i> 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.'

Quote: The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as<i> assignats,</i> `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. <i>Assignats</i> was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters' - sometimes written `skinplasters' - had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.
