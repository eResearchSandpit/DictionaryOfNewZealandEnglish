Quote: Stratfordites are beginning to recognise the necessity of having a more substantial bridge over the Patea river, and teamsters are a bit frightened about crossing over with a load of medium weight. And no wonder. It is surprising to many it has not collapsed before this. At all events to a town like Stratford it is an unsightly structure, whether fit to carry the traffic or not, and it is a menace to pedestrians when there is much traffic in the streets, especially on sale days, when cattle are being driven across.

Quote: The supply of medium horses has been good, but vendors looked for an advance; whereas prices ruled, upon the whole, lower. Consequently, a smaller number than is usual on a regular sale-day, was disposed of.

Quote: The little market town, with its handful of shops, its public house, its saleyards, was only two miles away. Thursday was Sale Day, when the farmers came in to buy and sell sheep or calves, heifers and pigs, and the farmer's wife to trade her butter and eggs at the grocer's for stores, and to buy towels and sheets and shoes. Market day, they would call it in England, but there was no market in these small New Zealand towns. There were no stalls in the street or square, where the farmer and his wife sold poultry and apples, eggs and butter, fruit and cream. The cows and sheep and horses and other farm stock were gathered into pens at the saleyard, and sold by auction.

Quote: Sale Day was always exciting in Kaitaia - especially in those early times when wild frightened cattle from the most northerly stations - cattle that had seen few human beings - were driven down the main road to the saleyards, then into the A. & P. grounds.
