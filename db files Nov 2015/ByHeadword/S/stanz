Quote: Bowden formed the Social Tonics Association of New Zealand (STANZ) and in February started work on its own code of practice. ... About 80% of manufacturers and retailers have signed up to the STANZ code, which requires that members adhere to the R18 sale restrictions, sets limits on the amount of BZP in pills and makes sure that manufacturing processes are consistent.
