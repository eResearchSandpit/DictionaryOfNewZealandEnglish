Quote: In order to prove beyond all doubt where you fitted in, a book was produced each year, called the stud book. Now at one point there were 42,000 people in the Post Office, every person was in there in seniority order, with your name, your grading, your rank, your salary. When you applied for a job, 30 others might apply for it with similar status, so the Promotion Board would refer back to the stud book - which everyone had access to - and it would show you that 'he gets that because he's the most senior person, not the most suitable, the most senior person.
