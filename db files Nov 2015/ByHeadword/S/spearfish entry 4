Quote:  I observed in one of the canoes a very singular fish, which the natives call <i>cokiddie</i>, or the spear-fish. It was about the size of a perch, and shaped very like it, except the head, which was rather [23] oblong, like that of a pig; its skin was quite rough, and behind its head nature had armed it with a sharp bone, about two inches long, which it could extrude and draw in at pleasure.
