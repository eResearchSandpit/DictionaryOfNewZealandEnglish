Quote: <i>Stamps</i>: The stamps pulverised the ore after it had passed through the crushers and been reduced to minus-two-and-a-half-inch size. They crushed it to a pulp, with water, until it passed through the 10-mesh (to the linear inch) screens on the mortar-box. There were five stamps (each weighing 1250 lb) to a mortar-box and they operated at 110 drops a minute from a height of 8 ins, crushing approximately 7 tons per 24-hour-day. They were driven by a camshaft, tappets attached to the long stamp stems being lifted in a particular sequence and then the whole weight of the stamp allowed to fall on the ore. Wear of iron was approximately half a pound per ton of ore crushed; the shoes and dies were cast in the Waikino foundry.
