Quote: New Zealand straddles the southern arm of the so-called Subtropical Gyre, the massive counter-clockwise flow of water around the South Pacific. From South America, water moves westward to Australia, turns south and strengthens as the East Australian Current; then off New South Wales it turns east as the Tasman Front, passing around Northland to spawn the weak West Auckland current (extending to Auckland) and the strong East Auckland Current (extending to East Cape).
