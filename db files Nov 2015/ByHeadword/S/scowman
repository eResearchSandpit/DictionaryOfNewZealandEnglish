Quote: ... and Ted Ashby on scowmen: `... [sic] on the stock and cattle scows, the skipper and the crew had to be as good as a good back-country farmer; they had to know how to handle cattle. On the log scows they had to be as good as a bushman, because they had to know how to jack timber ... and they had to be straight-out shifting men with wheelbarrows and shovels ...'
