Quote: The Wellington City Council is considering changing to an STV (Single Transferable Vote) system for the 2004 local body elections... Under STV, voters have one vote. But their vote can be transferred from their first choice candidate to their next preferred candidate if their first choice already has enough votes to be elected or has so few votes as to have no chance of being elected.
