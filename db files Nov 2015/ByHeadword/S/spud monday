Quote: [An endearing feature of Nelson is the holiday called `Spud Monday'] It started when the young settlement depended on visiting boats for many supplies ... The ship was delayed ... When supplies came, the half-starving community declared a holiday and a feast- of potatoes. This day which coincided with England's August Bank Holiday was thereafter held as `Spud Monday'
