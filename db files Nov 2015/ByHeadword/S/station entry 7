Quote: <i>Station, n.</i> Sometimes <i>sheep s., cattle- s.</i>, or <i>dairy-s</i>., (PAUL, p. 68); originally the hut, yards, and buildings where a squatter stationed himself to work his run; but now usually the whole property, including the stock and leasehold country. It has been used in both these senses in Australia (whence the word came) since the 'thirties. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (1) The original sense is still preserved up country, where the men always speak of <i>in at the s</i>., when they are out on the run; also in the word <i>out-s</i>. (q.v.), which has no other meaning than the house, yards etc. (2) The secondary sense of a property with freehold, leasehold, buildings, and stock. (3) Any fairly large property, carrying over 2000 or 3000 sheep. (4) Adjective as in s.horse, belonging to the owner, not to one of the man, whose horses are<i> private; s. sheep</i>, not one belonging to a neighbour; <i>s.-bred,</i> not a bought sheep. (5) Since the 1890s, auctioneers in their advertisements have taken to speaking of <i>s. lines</i> of sheep, though 70 per cent. of those so designated at the autumn ewe fairs come from farms or grazing runs. ([1898 Morris Austral-English])

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late `fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Quote: It is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, I only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.
