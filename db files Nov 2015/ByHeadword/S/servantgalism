Quote: Amazing, the words people find buried in unlikely websites. Geoff Sommerville was browsing through Papers Past last 19th-century section of the National Library's site, and chanced on servantgalism. He reports the context told him it was a term for servants who got too big for their boots. Servantgalism, and its male equivalent flunkeiana, were slang words in use in colonial Australia when servants were hard to come by. <i>Melbourne Punch</i> in 1861, for instance, ran a cartoon of a prospective employer offering to drown a few of his children to accommodate a maid who found looking after seven would be too much.
