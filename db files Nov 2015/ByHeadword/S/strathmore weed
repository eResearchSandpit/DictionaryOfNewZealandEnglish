Quote: The first case of Strathmore weed poisoning known in the Wairarapa occurred some days ago, when out of a number of draught horses stricken two died... He noticed.. little clumps of a weed very like the garden daphne growing in the paddock where the horses had been feeding... The weed in question is native, and known by the names Mataikairanga and Strathmore. The name Strathmore was given after the name of the locality near Hawera, where the first reported case of animal sickness through eating the weed was made known some eight years ago... The first symptoms of Strathmore poisoning are loss of appetite, and then dullness. followed by tremors, staggering, distressed breathing, and convulsions, which in the severe cases are followed by death.
