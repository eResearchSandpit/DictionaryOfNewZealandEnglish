Quote: What, then, is a smallfarmer? "A vertically challenged agriculturalist," runs the well-worn joke. While names like "smallholder" or the American "homesteader" might be less obvious butts, they are really no more descriptive. "Toy farmer" is obviously derisive, while "hobby farmer" rather unfairly equates small-scale farming with stamp collecting or restoring old cars. <i>Ibid.</i> 42 John Fairweather.. defines smallfarmers (or smallholders, as he categorises them) as people who have  a commitment to effective land use, and who earn at least some farm income. They differ from a group he calls "lifestylers" - a term derived from the ubiquitous "life style block" dreamed up by real-estate agents when they began to sell the concept of country living 20 years ago.
