Quote:  SNAPPER ... The common name `snapper' was given to the fish by Captain Cook in 1770. He mistook it for a member of the true snapper family <i>Lutjanidae </i>, a group of fish with which he had become familar in American waters. Although he did mistake the fish Captain Cook spelt the name correctly, whereas many subsequent writers have used `schnapper' - an erroneous spelling of unknown origin. Perhaps some of the early snapper fishermen took bottles of schnapps along on their outings, hence going `schnapping'!

Quote: Bellamy's menu has qualified as the most snobbish of all State papers. Whenever the well-known New Zealand fish called snapper is an item of Parliamentary diet it is invariable [sic] spelled `schnapper.' The gourmets of the Food and Wine Society could be forgiven for such literary heresy, but the old prosaic spelling should be good enough for the dining-room in Parliament House. Incidentally, the legend is that the fish was given the name `snapper' by Captain Cook when he was here on his voyage of exploration in 1770. As he and the members of his crew leaned over the side of their galleon two centuries ago and threw their fishing lines into the waters off the New Zealand coast the fish used to snap at the bait. Hence the name snapper.

Quote: My reference in last week's column to the snobbishness of Bellamy's in using the spelling `schnapper' when that fish was on its menu has brought `bites' galore - from fish merchants to schoolmasters. Most of them, it is fair to say, have taken up the cudgels on behalf of Bellamy's, but none of them has disproved my argument that the correct spelling is `snapper.' ... Some historians support my Captain Cook theory, though there are others who place the first use of the name `snapper' at a later date, certainly not earlier. They think the name may have been given the fish by Captain W. L. Edwardson, the commander of a New South Wales Government cutter called the Snapper which was in New Zealand waters in 1822 and 1823 investigating sealing prospects. He gave the name Port Snapper to an inlet on Ruapuke Island in Foveaux Strait. Whatever the origin of the word, the fish served at Bellamy's is indigenous to New Zealand and is spelt `snapper.'

Quote:  <i>Schnapper </i> or <i> Snapper </i>... a fish abundant in all Australasian waters, <i>Pagrus unicolor </i>, Cuv. and Val. The latter spelling was the original form of the word (one that snaps). It was gradually changed by the fishermen, perhaps of Dutch origin, to <i>Schnapper </i>, the form now general. The name <i>Snapper </i> is older than the settlement of Australia, but it is not used for the same fish. `O.E.D.,' s.v. <i>Cavally </i>, quotes: ... In New Zealand, the <i>Tamure </i> (q.v.) is also called <i>Schnapper </i>, and the name <i>Red-Schnapper i </i>s given to <i>Anthias richardsoni </i>, Gunth., or <i> Scorpis hectori </i>, Hutton.
