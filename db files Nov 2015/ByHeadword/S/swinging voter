Quote: The swinging voter - whether truly undecided or only softly committed - remains as high as 25 percent in some (mostly urban) electorates... Swinging voters tend to be susceptible to the "presidential" aspects of the campaign, committing themselves finally in response to the campaign intangibles - the television debates, leadership style, campaign tone and the emerging sense of a winner... Early in the campaign, the swinging vote began moving Labour's way.
