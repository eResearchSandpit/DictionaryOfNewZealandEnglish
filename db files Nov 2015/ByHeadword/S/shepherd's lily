Quote: Snow-apple may be a unique and personal description, I suspect (just as <i>Ranunculus lyallii</i>, the Mt Cook Lily, was once called the Shepherd's Lily)

Quote: <i> Ranunculus Lyallii (Lyall's Ranunculus)</i> ... The plant is known to colonists as the Mountain, Shepherd's, or Mount Cook Lily. The name is [167] most inappropriate, as the plantis not a lily, but a large white buttercup. However, any large-leaved herbaceous native plant is called by the colonists a lily, especially if it has white flowers.
