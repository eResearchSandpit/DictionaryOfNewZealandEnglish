Quote: Another form of gambling ... is that known as `selling a horse' ... A member of the party thinks of, or writes down a number and another member starts counting, beginning at any number below ten, and the party takes it in turn to count, much as in the Army a platoon is numbered off. The member saying the number thought of or written down collects the pool.

Quote: The procedure is sometimes referred to as `selling a horse' Each person pools so much money and a number is written down and hidden from view. The person who writes a number down requests one of the others to start counting, commencing at any number desired, provided that it is lower than the winning number. The counting is then carried on in rotation and stops when the written number is reached. The winner then takes the pool and pays for whatever has been purchased ....

Quote:  `That doesn't buy our drinks,' said Sam. Another man said: `We'll sell a horse, and find out who pays.' They were selling the horse, when a big black car slid up against the kerb. A voice called: `What's the trouble, you men?'

Quote: Another form of gambling which I view much less harshly is that known as `selling a horse.' The process is as follows. A member of the party thinks of, or writes down a number and another member starts counting, beginning at any number below ten, and the party takes it in turn to count, much as in the Army a platoon is numbered off. The member saying the number thought of or written down collects the pool. This game, though coming under the heading Games of Chance is probably the one really honest game in that category. I myself usually win it, especially in parties where there is no one with a pencil and I think of the number.
