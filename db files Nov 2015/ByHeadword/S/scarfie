Quote: The term "Scarfie" is thought to have been coined in the 1960s, after it was noticed that Dunedin students wore scarves constantly because of the lack of adequate heating in theiur homes. Since then, the culture has been immortalised in the moved <i>Scarfies</i>, and sensationalised, annually, in documentary and news footage of orientation week. But, once upon a time, the Scarfie lifestyle was about more than how much beer you could drink before flashing your butt at a waiting TV camera.

Quote: The University of Otago was the country's first when it was founded in 1869. The term "scarfies" was derived from the fact that because of the weather, the students usually wore scarves, often in the Otago colours of blue and gold. Today, scarfies make up about 20% of Dunedin's population. They hike up hills at the speed of light and have a dress sense all their own.
