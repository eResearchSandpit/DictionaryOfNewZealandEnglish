Quote: The cost of erecting silos is considerable; therefore it is recommended that in the first instance stack ensilage should be made. The great advantage of stack ensilage is that the stack may be built in any paddock .. A striking example of the success of stack ensilage may be found at Mr Emil Meuli's farm near Okaiawa.
