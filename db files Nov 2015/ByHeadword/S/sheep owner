Quote: When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.
