Quote: Out on the tops the old remedy for indicating a route was a pile of stones collected together - the cairn. Anyone can build them, and so once again a more official marking system had to be found. Routes became, as the maps put it, `poled', which [26] meant that metal standards were studded along the tops, These can also be called snow-poles or sometimes waratahs.
