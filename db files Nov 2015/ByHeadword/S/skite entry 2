Notes: [The New Zealand and Australian use may be from dialect `<i>skite, skyte'</i>, influenced by <i>blatherskite </i>, or a development from `<i>blatherskite </i>', distinct from, but probably parallel with, the dial development. <i>Blather </i> n and v is, or was, common in New Zealand. I have heard <i>blatherskite, bletherskite </i> used occasionally by old people.]
