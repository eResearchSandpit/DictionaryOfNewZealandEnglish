Quote: By the time you've queued in a sheep-dip race to get your boarding pass, stood like a charlie with your arms scarecrowed out so a security guard can make your bra underwiring beep, had a flight attendant read your seat number out to you as if you are a half-wit, waited several minutes in the aisle while inconsiderate ditherers fuss with the overhead locker, annoyed the poor person in the aisle of your row by making him or her stand up and block the aisle all over again so you can get to your seat ... you're ready to be left in peace.
