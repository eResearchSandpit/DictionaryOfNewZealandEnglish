Quote: There are ... quite a few cases where there is a distinct New Zealand word - <i>cutty grass, freezing works, graunch, ranch-slider, pie-cart, sheepmeat and jandals ((P)</i> for proprietary name); no etymology is given for the last-named; I am told it is a portmanteau word from <i>Japanese sandals; </i>
