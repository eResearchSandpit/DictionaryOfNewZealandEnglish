Notes: Kerry Carman writes (Sept. 2000): <i>Gaultheria antipoda</i> is the Bush Snowberry; fruits are 15 mm and may be white, pink, red or purple. Confusing the issue are two other candidates, also commonly called snowberries. (a). <i>Pernettya</i> is also an edible Snowberry, sometimes white, sometimes red. Like <i>Gaultheria</i> it is of the <i>Ericaceae</i> with which it bydrisies freely in the wild. (b). <i>Leucopogon (Epacridaceae)</i> is another edible native Snowberry from the region. It ranges from white through pinks and red to purple.

Quote: Snowberry <i>Gaultheria antipoda</i> Tawiniwini; bush snowberry <i>Gaultheria depressa</i> Mountain snowberry... Both shrubs are rather similar except that bush snowberry grows up to about 1.5 metres and has leaves 80-16mm long, while mountain snowberry is a low spreading plant seldom more than 10 cm high, with smaller leaves 4-8 mm long. <i>Ibid.</i> 54 In 1864, Barrington.. was grateful at one point for the sustenance these fruits provided: 'I was so weak that I thought I must give in, but I ate plenty of the little snowberries which grow under the snow. They helped us a good deal.'

Quote: The pink, red or white berries of this shrub were gathered in the past by men of the village when larger, more tasty berries were unobtainable. Snowberries are a favourite food of the weka bird, they were also sought by the early sheep musterers and prospectors of Otago in the high country when emergency rations were needed.

Quote: Sometimes plants belonging to even different genera can cross - for example, our native <i>Gaultheria</i>, and <i>Pernettya</i> snow-berries cross shamelessly, and only expert field botanists and biochemists can figure out which of the several species in the genus are the parents of the hybrid.

Quote: Richards describes the fruit of the creeping mountain snowberry as 'edible and rather tasteless.' Earlier travellers, who had perhaps worked up a better appetite, have kinder words for them; J.T. Thomson, while exploring South Otago in 1857, seemed to appreciate the New Zealand strawberry, as he called it, and likens it to the rose apple of India.
