Quote: Only let him occupy one of the many roadside farms to which he alludes for a few months, and be subjected to the daily and hourly pesterings to which we are subjected by hundreds of swagmen, sundowners, and other loafers - the majority of whom cannot do a day's work when they get the chance - and it strikes me very forcibly that his goodly Samaritan learnings [sic] would receive such a shock that he would experience no difficulty in understanding the reception he met with.

Quote: The [peripatetic labourers] in the colony are known by the name of `Swaggers' or `Sundowners' Swaggers, because they carry a swag or bundle on their backs ... Sundowners, because they never approach a habitable place before sundown lest they should be requested to take a further stroll.

Quote: About these wayfarers Mr. Cameron had something to tell me, for they were odd members of the idle class known as swaggers and sundowners ... [249] So far as I could discriminate, swaggers (those who, snail-like, carry their worldly possessions on their backs) are men occasionally willing to do a day's work for a night's lodging and a couple of meals. Sundowners (those who have no possessions to carry) walk from station to station during the day, and, sleeping under a haystack until sunset, make their appearance at that hour before the `whares' or huts provided for them, and demand from the owners supper and shelter, which are generally granted.

Quote: fn The term `swagger' is applied to a man who tramps from place to place in quest of work, carrying all his worldly goods in a swag, or bundle, thrown across his back. The `sun-downer' is one who tramps from place to place pretending to seek employment, but, as a matter of fact living upon the supper and breakfast with which he is supplied at most up-country stations. He fears to arrive too early in the day, lest he should be requested to seek a bed elsewhere, and hence the name with which he has been endowed.

Quote: Now, a `sundowner' or `tussocker' for the terms are synonymous - is a pastoral loafer; one who loiters about till dusk, and then makes for the nearest station or hut, to beg for shelter and food.

Quote: Those who join it [the professional unemployed] are distinguished from `sundowners' ... by working chiefly in towns instead of in the open country, and in swarms instead of alone. It has, therefore, several advantages over `sundowning'. The professional unemployed need not tramp ten, twelve, or twenty miles a day, and he always has congenial company.
