Quote:  [Mrs Annette Wale of Johnsonville writes:] `For the last two or three years in spring I have had a new garden pest, ... I call it the Spittle Bug because it lives in a white foam on the underside of leaves, and the foam looks like spittle. It is a small lime-green bug with a pointed end. ... <i>Spittle Bug is commonly known by this name and it is also called Cuckoo Spit. It is more apparent this year because of the very wet season, but it is by no means a new pest. </i>
