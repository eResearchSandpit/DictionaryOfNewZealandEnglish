Quote: But I mustn't forget the `slush-lamp.' This consists of an old pannikin about three parts filled with clay, and the other part with tallow, in the middle of which is a small piece of rag of some sort (cotton, of course) sticking out of the fat about a quarter of an inch. The rag is lit with a match or a stick from the fire; the wick is fed by the surrounding fat, and the surrounding darkness is made visible.
