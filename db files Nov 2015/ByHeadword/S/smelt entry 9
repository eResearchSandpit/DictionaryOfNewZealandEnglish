Quote: Easily confused with the common smelt is Stokell's smelt (<i>Stokellia anisodon</i>), which occurs only in the South Island, from about Waimakariri south to the Waiau in Southland... Shoals of Stokell's smelt migrate into Canterbury rivers in spring and are caught by whitebaiters in larger numbers.
