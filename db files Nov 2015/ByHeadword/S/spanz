Quote: Spanz Viewmaster DC3s trundled through New Zealand skies until February 1966 and were a byword for service... The can-do airline was the brainchild of two NAC captains, Rex Daniell, of Auckland, and Bob Anderson, of Paraparaumu... In some rural centres the public service mindset appplied so that bowsers were locked at 5pm on the knocker - woe betide a Spanz DC3 that failed to beat the knock-off clock.
