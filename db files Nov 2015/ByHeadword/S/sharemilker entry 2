Quote: Take the sharemilker who is milking his 100 cows. He rises at half-past two a.m., and musters his cows, has to get them miked by seven o'clock, take his milk to the factory; and after that has to feed over 90 calves, and about thirty pigs. He has to provide root crops for his pigs, and see that he has a sufficient supply of hay, etc., for his cows in the winter, keep his fences in repair, and stump what ground he requires to grow his crops. There is no eight hours for that sharemilker.

Quote: <i>sharemilker</i>-One who contracts to milk a herd of cows for a share of profits. In general, sharemilkers fall into three categories: first, the 29 per cent sharemilker, second, the 39 per cent man, third, the 50 per cent man. The 29 per cent man contracts to milk the farmer's herd and attend to their wants only; he helps at haymaking, etc. as part of the herd's `wants', but in general, once the cows have been attended to for the two daily milkings, his time is his own. The 39 per cent man contracts to milk the herd owned by the farmer and to do all the other general farm work. For this he receives 39 per cent of the herd profits. The 50 per cent sharemilker runs his own herd of cows on another man's land. He does all the farm work, and receives 50 per cent of the profits. Many farmers who today have their own farms in New Zealand started off as 39 per cent share milkers, saved enough to buy their own herds and so became 50 per cent milkers, then saved again to purchase land themselves (or on which they put sharemilkers!)

Quote: A feature of dairy-farming in New Zealand has been the development of share-milking, akin to the old French system of me[acute]tayage or the sharefarming common with annual crops such as cotton in the United states of America. Under this system the owner usually provides the land, plant, and herd, while the share-milker provides labour and receives in return one-third to one-half of the gross returns. In other cases the sharemilker also provides the dairy herd and receives two-thirds of the gross receipts.
