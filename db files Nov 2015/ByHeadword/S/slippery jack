Quote: Slippery Jack (<i>Suillus luteus</i>) But if the cepe is a lamentable rarity, its distant cousin, the slippery jack, carpets our pine forests every autumn. Slippery jack is always found near pine trees, so given New Zealand's huge pine population, it may well be our most common edible mushroom. The slipper jack is possibly more accurately known as the pine boletus.
