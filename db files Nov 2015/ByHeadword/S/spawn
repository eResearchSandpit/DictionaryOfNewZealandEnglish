Quote: A very strange appearance presented itself in the water this morning - streaks of a muddy yellow colour extending for miles. Supposing it to be caused by animalculae I had a bucketful drawn on deck. The water was full of them, having a transparent body with a row of yellow spots round the head. They had long tentaculae, and moved briskly through the water backwards, which motion was effected by ejecting water from two openings situated at the base of the tentaculae. These creatures are generally called [32] `spawn' by sailors; being by them considered the spawn of fish and the food of whales.
