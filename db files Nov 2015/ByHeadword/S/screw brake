Quote: Mr Liddell [aged over 100] continued his description of bullock-driving as follows: `The best brake where the road was not too steep was for the polers to hold up a chain with an iron shoe on it, and this slipped under the near side wheel and put a drag on. The screw-brake across the back of the dray was effective, but difficult, because if you left your bullocks to go behind to screw it up, anything might happen in your brief absence.
