Quote: In the New Zealand team, current coach David Trist and his predecessors during the 1990s...have all been in charge of various teams that have sledged... One provincial coach I spoke to says he likes he players to ger worked up and he certainly doesn't mind sledging... I don't take any pride in the news that New Zealand out-sledged England in 1999.

Quote: [Former Aussie test spinner,Kerry O'Keefe] said the term traced back to a barbecue after a day's play in a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and NSW in the early 1970s... one of the NSW players made inappropriate comments to a woman and was pulled into line by former state captain John Benaud. "Benaud added that the transgressor's outburst was 'as subtle as a sledgeghammer'. He momentarily became known as 'Percy Sledgehammer' a reference to soul singer Percy Sledge. The 'Percy' soon disappeared and for the remainder of the season anybody who used over-the-top language was known as a 'sledge'.
