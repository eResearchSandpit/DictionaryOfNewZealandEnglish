Quote: On July 21, the horse teams and their owners would brush up their skills ploughing a 12 ha stubble paddock, Mr Robson said. The first day would give time to iron out any problems before the actual competition the next day when the teams would be allocated plots in a smaller roadside stubble paddock.
