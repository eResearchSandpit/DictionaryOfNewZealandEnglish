Quote: In order to reduce the cost to as small a sum as possible the five-inch water mains which were used at the Matarae camp last year were procured, and regular fatigue parties drawn in rotation from the various reinforcement drafts and new units were put to work with scrub cutters, picks, and shovels, to cut a straight track through the brughwood from the camp to the springs, dig the necessary trench, and lay the water main.
