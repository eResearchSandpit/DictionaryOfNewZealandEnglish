Quote: <i>Shout.</i> `A call to a waiter to replenish the glasses of a company: hence, a turn in paying for a round of drinks. Also, a free drink given to all present by one of the company; a drinking party,' this last being rare: Australian, hence New Zealand; by 1903 (indeed, long before that: see H., 3rd ed., 1864), fairly gen.: 1863, H. Simcox, `Many a `shout' they're treated to.' O.E.D. and Morris. Ex<i> shout</i>, v.i. - 2. Hence, one's turn to entertain another: from ca1885. E.g. `It's my shout this time.' Baumann.
