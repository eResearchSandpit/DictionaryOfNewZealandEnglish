Notes: Jim Cameron writes : This crime was introduced in 1985 so that an accused is charged with sexual violation and not with rape or sodomy. (<i>Rape</i> is however retained in the definition of the crime). The term is not specifically recorded in NSOD, Collins or ODL, and it has a precise legal meaning in NZ that is not replicated in England. See Crimes Act 1961, s 128
