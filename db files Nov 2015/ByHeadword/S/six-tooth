Quote:  <i>Ages of sheep</i>. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a <i>hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a <i>ram lamb</i> until castrated, then a <i>wether</i>. A female lamb is a <i>ewe lamb</i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i>shorn hogget </i> until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a <i>two-tooth</i>. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i>four-tooth</i>, then a <i>six-tooth</i> and then an <i>eight-tooth </i> or <i>full-mouthed</i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.
