Quote: It was astonishing the tremendous loads they could pull out of the bush along the ground - `snigging', that was called. In many places the logs were brought out on what was called a `cat', which was short for catamaran. A catamaran was a big heavy sledge made of bush timber ... The bushmen would build a special road for them - a corduroy road, or `skidded' road, as we used to call it.
