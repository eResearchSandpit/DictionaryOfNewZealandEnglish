Quote: It is considered that there are greatpossibilities in the New Zealand marketfor Avocado pears, more widely known inthe South Seas as "subaltern's butter"...The name "subaltern's butter" was derivedfrom the fact that in the old days whenthere were many military posts in theSouth Seas and supplies of fresh food,including dairy butter, were often short,the subaltern on duty in the officers'mess of any camp frequently arranged forquantities of Avocado pears to be sent tothe cookhouse, and the prepared fruit wasserved in place of butter.[Well, that's their story anyhow, and theOtago Daily Times was a family paper].
