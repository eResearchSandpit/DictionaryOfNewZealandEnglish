Quote: Great attention should be paid to the gold saving appliances, as no matter how much wash is treated, if you do not save the gold it will be impossible for the dredge to pay. There should be a save-all box as well. This box can be of wood or iron, fitted up with steel ripples, and should be placed in such a way as to catch all of the dirt that escapes the main shoot or drop plate.
