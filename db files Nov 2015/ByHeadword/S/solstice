Notes: Jim writes: As an attributive, in relation to the winter solstice, this has come into use in NZ recently in compounds such as <i>(winter) solstice carnival, solstice celebration, solstice dinner, solstice party</i>. Any similar usages in the Northern Hemisphere (none are recorded in NSOD or Collins) are likely to relate to the summer solstice, since the winter solstice coincides with Christmas. I havs also seen <i>winter Christmas</i> used in NZ. The development of "solstice" terms might usefully be watched.
