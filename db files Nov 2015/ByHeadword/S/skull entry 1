Quote: Some [student association] presidents manage better than others at jug sculls! With suitable decorum and dignity, one nameless Auckland Prez managed to scull a jug in the public bar of a venerable Auckland drinking establishment, whereupon he escaped, or so he thought, to the sanctuary of the lounge bar. However, he was pressed into sculling another jug - which he did, maintaining his dignity, and most importantly of all, his liquor, all the while. <i> jug sculls,</i> a simple matter of either <i>being able to </i> or <i> not being able to </i> were won by a Canterbury drinker. The University of Canterbury Student's Association had sent down a team for this event and the <i> boat races.</i>
