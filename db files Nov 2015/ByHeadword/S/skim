Quote: He would probably get a neighbouring farmer to skim a few acres during the summer while he worked for someone else or built his whare or rough house. In the autumn he would fence the field he intended to crop and get the person who skimmed the land to put in a crop for him, he in his turn fencing for the man who had the team.
