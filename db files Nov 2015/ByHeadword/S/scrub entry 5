Quote:  SCENE: away down the bottom of Westland. This old chap's job for many years was scrubbing the packtrack. -->`This always sounded a bit odd to me,'...'I never failed to picture him down on his knees, soap and hot water, scrubbing.' -->The old chap, the scrubber, lived in an ancient hut, a mere shell of wood, a door at one end, a chimney at the other.
