Quote: One of our favourites [on Stewart Island] was the silver penny or <i> Myadora</i> [shell]. The flat valve was the `silver penny' but the concave valve was lovely too, and much rarer. Both were lined with a pearly lustre, the `silver pennies' sometimes in hundreds high up on the beach ... gleaming in the sun.
