Quote: I am writing to ask whether you know the origin and meaning of the phrase `sucked the kumera'. The phrase has come into use among a group that I associate with. One member thinks that he may have read the phrase in a NZ Listener article that described either a broken down or crashed rally car as having `sucked the kumera'. It would appear to mean `broken' or in equivalently colloquial terms `come a cropper'.
