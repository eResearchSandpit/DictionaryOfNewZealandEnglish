Notes: ca1941 still in use, but not common >ca1980 heard in Wellington -->(I have been told that in Dunedin about the turn of the century it was a game or `dare' among school-children to arm themselves with pieces of board with four-inch nails driven through one end, then rush past a Chinese fruiterer's shop in a gang spearing on the way past some of the fruit which was then laid out in piles right onto the footpath. Perhaps this partly explains the use, or continued use, of `spike' HWO 1953)
