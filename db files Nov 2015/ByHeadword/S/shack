Quote: He [the pioneer pastoralist] has built a domicile of some sort, be it of canvas, calico, bagging, sticks, ferntrees, grass, slabs, mud, clay, stone, or wattle and daub. He may call it various names according to its materials, but three names would not enter his head - i.e., crib, bach, or shack. He may call it a cabin, a shanty, a cottage, a warrie [whare], but probably he would use the commonest term of all - hut.
