Quote: There are more terms for those officers who are either new to the prison or have just finished training, such as <i>baby screw, schoolboy screw, prospect, new on the floor, rookie</i> and <i>scobie</i>. The latter term is a blend of letters from two words : <i>screw</i> for prison guard, and <i>probie</i>, a white gang prospect still in training.
