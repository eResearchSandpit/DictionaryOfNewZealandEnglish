Quote: Solo butchering was hard work. There was a lot of bending and lifting required. Lifting 140lb sheep carcase on to a hook at chin height required considerable effort. Tally was 90 per day, that's what the company expected from its solo butchers. There were no make ups for lost hooks, a butcher was paid for what he killed.
