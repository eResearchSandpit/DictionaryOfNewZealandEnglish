Quote: <i>Shepherd</i>.- ... (2) To tail sheep by day and yard them at night. The<i> shepherding</i> system of sheep management was much employed in the early days of Australia, where the sheep would otherwise have been exposed to attack from blacks and dingoes. The <i>shagroons</i> (q.v.) carried it on to some extent on the Canterbury plains in the 'fifties, but soon gave it up for a system of <i>boundary keeping</i>, and afterwards fenced their runs. (C.) 3. To be a shepherd, e.g. `Bill is <i>shepherding</i> at __'s.'
