Quote: The Black or River Flounder of New Zealand  (<i>Rhombosolea retiaria</i>). The river-flounder is one of the common edible fishes of Wellington. Though not so common as either the yellow or sand flounder, it is much in demand as the chief delicacy among all species of flat fish eaten by the New Zealand public.

Quote: NEW ZEALAND SAND-FLOUNDER (PATIKI) <i>Rhombosolea plebeia</i>(Richardson) ... The common Sand-flounder is known from one end of New Zealand to the other, sometimes by other names in different localities. In Auckland it is known as the Dab.../ Some refer to it as Tinplate or Three Corner; the latter name is derived from its fancied trangular shape but why Tinplate I am at a loss to know. To other than fishermen and those intimately connected with the fishing industry it is just a Flounder. Some say it is Tinplate because when cooked it fills a plate.
