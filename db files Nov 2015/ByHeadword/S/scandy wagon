Quote: In the museum.. you can see extensive displays testifying to the toil of Norsewood's pioneers: human yokes, huge cheese pans and gigantic cross-cut saws, and "Scandy wagons" - heavy wooden drays with the distinctive four-spoked wheels. In recent years Norsewood has promoted itself as "the troll capital of the Southern Hemisphere", but many residents are adamant that the Scandy wheel is the true symbol of Norsewood.

Quote: Ole Olsen had built a new big cart... Most useful, the women knew only too well, for travelling long distances in a cart fitted with the so-called 'Scandi wheels'. 'Scandi waggons' were very good for heavy loads,  but they did not ordinarily cater to the comfort of their drivers.
