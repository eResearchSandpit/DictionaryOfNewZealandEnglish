Quote: We found, however, no scarcity of ordinary fish - blue cod, trumpeter, and a sort of silver trumpeter known as "white fish" forming a conspicuous article of die [sic]; whereas at the Bluff where there was no lack of oysters of course, I found that fish was so scarce that at the principal hotel "canned fish" was one of the items on the bill of fare.
