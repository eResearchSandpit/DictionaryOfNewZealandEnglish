Quote: The word "dregs" refers to the drippings from the taps in a bar and to the overflow from the glasses as they are filled.  These dregs are sometimes called "swill".. or "slops". When they are mixed with beer for sale the resultant liquid is colloquially known as "Wompo". The term has been in use among barmen for as long as one experienced licensee could recollect - from twenty to thirty years.., and it is known to the man in the street. <i>Ibid.</i> 115 The resultant "Wompo" was then served to the public.
