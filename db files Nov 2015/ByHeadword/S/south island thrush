Quote: Family TURNAGRIDAE (thrushes). Any thrushes most of us see today are likely (let's face it) to be imported ones; however, Oliver's description of the native South Island thrush (<i>Turnagra capensis</i>) optimistically puts its distribution (south-west of South Island, west Nelson) in the present tense. The last North Island one definitely recorded was encountered in 1887.
