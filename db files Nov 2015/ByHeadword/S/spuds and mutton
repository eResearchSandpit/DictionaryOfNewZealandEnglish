Quote: ... on the old days at some stations, when a swagger arrived, he reported himself to the owner or the manager and received a ticket which he had to present to the station cook. He then either received `spuds and mutton' or sat down at the table with the station hands. ...[2nd quote] When the guard came to collect the tickets, he tapped Mr. Tripp on the shoulder saying `tickets please'. C.G.Tripp replied `go to the cook, spuds and mutton you know'. [1885 - Owner of Otari Gorge on train in England]
