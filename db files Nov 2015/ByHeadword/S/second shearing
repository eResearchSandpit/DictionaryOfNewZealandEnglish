Quote: Different names are given to the sheep, according to its age or sex; for instance, in England, the male is called a tup (we call it here a ram); after weaning he is called a tup hog or a teg, and if castrated, a wether hog; after shearing, when he is a year or a year and a-half old, he is called a shear hog or shearling; and a shearing wether if castrated, after second shearing, he is a two shear tup, or wether, and so  on.
