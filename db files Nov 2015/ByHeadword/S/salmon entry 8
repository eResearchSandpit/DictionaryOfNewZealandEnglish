Quote: There are in [Otago] harbour and in the bays outside the heads numbers of salmon or sea-trout (the true <i> Salmo trutta),</i>  the finest fish which can be got here. I do not mean the brown-trout, which are also abundant. The society prohibits the sale of these fish (which the fishermen locally call salmon) except on payment of a fee for a license [sic], which, however, no one takes out.
