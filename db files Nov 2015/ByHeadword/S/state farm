Quote: STATE FARMS. The Minister of Lands has successfully initiated a system of paying parties of working-men to fell bush on Crown lands, giving to these men the option of choice of lands so felled and cleared. <i>Ibid.</i> H6/3 A State Farm proper of about 1,000 acres has been commenced at Levin... Fifty-two men, eight women, and twenty-five children are on the ground, the men doing the preparatory work, cutting roads through the forest, felling bush for burning, planting orchards, &c.. getting ready for the permanent homestead to be laid out... The State Farm is directed by an able agriculturalist as Manager, who is appointed by the Government... There is every probability that the State farm will become a paying investment on the capital expended, as well as an outlet for a description of labour - viz., that of elderly men - which cannot find occupation elsewhere in times of pressure, but which has deserved well of the colony by previous long and hard service.
