Quote: For the preparation of the skidded road the ground would first be made as level as possible ... The next proceeding was to procure good solid saplings, ten to twelve inches diameter, and from nine to twelve in length, and lay them across the road, from seven to nine feet apart, and partly sunk in the ground to enable the bullocks to pass over them. It was, of course, these cross pieces or skids, that gave the road its name ... .

Quote: ... forming ... the `skidded roads' that were so often used in getting the timber out. These were roads ... 10-12 feet in width and of easy grade, on which the skids 8-9 inches in diameter and 10 feet long, were transversely spaced about five feet apart. These were carefully levelled.

Quote: It was astonishing the tremendous loads they could pull out of the bush along the ground - `snigging', that was called. In many places the logs were brought out on what was called a `cat', which was short for catamaran. A catamaran was a big heavy sledge made of bush timber ... The bushmen would build a special road for them - a corduroy road, or `skidded' road, as we used to call it.
