Quote: <i>Smother.</i>- Run sheep especially merinos, are very easy to s. on broken hill ground. An injudicious turn with a dog in an abrupt gully may stop the lead and cause some sheep to be knocked over. Other sheep make a rush and are brought down too, so that in a second or two there is struggling heap; and before the shepherd can pull them off one another the bottom ones are <i>smothered </i>. They <i> sd.</i> 1200 once on the Stew Point country at Mount Peel, and I believe there was a still worse <i> s </i>. on a station called Roxburgh in Otago. People who fill their woolsheds too tight often <i>smother </i> sheep on a smaller scale: perhaps half a dozen or so in a night. (C.)

Quote: Difficulties arose only when they started to go in the wrong direction and had to be stopped, or when a large mob was in hand and a steep, narrow gully had to be crossed; then there was always the danger of a `smother.' Of all breeds the Merino is the easiest to smother, for he moves freer, faster, and more recklessly than any other. If pressed or carelessly handled, some of the leaders may fall or be knocked over and those behind will pile up on top of them until the gully is filled level to the top with struggling sheep.
