Quote: While the squatters could get men to travel out back from 500 to 1000 miles and put up with mutton, damper, black sugar, and blacker tea for 15s to 17s 6d a week, and pig-up in dens unfit for pigs; and so long as men could be got to shear sandy-backed and burr-infected sheep for 15s a hundred, and travel hundreds of miles to and from the sheds, the squatters never sought to improve the conditions or increase the rate of pay, but the expansion of the pastoral industry kept on apace, and the present set-back is but the result of years of thoughtlessness and bad management.
