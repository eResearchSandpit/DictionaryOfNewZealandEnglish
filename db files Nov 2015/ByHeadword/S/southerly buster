Definition:? orig Canterbury, but general South Island and Cook Strait. see esp. buster, and see butt=ender; see also south-easter, souther, southern buster, sou'west buster, threeday sou'wester Acland's note and description (1933) applies (also CR. 68): A strong wind with rain, snow or sleet from a southerly direction. The ordinary man in the paddock in Canterbury recognises only three winds: <i> East </i> (from N.E.),<i> sou'wester </i> (from S.E., S. etc, S.W. etc), and nor'wester. <i> As a matter of fact a three-day so'wester usually only lasts two and a half. They are said to be less fierce than in the early days, just as the nor'wester is said to have been softened by the planting on the plains. It may be so in Christchurch </i>; but I cannot say I notice any difference up-country. The <i> nor'</i> wester <i> may come from any where between due north and due west. In such places as Hororata, where the wind can get at you between two gorges a distinction is made between a Waimakariri and a Rakaia nor' wester; but both are called nor' westers. </i>
