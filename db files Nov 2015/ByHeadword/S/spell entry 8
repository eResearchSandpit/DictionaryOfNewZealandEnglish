Quote: In England, a turn at work or duty; in Australasia, always a period of rest from duty. It is quite possible that etymologically </i>Spell </i> is connected with Ger.<i> spielen </i>, in which case the Australasian use is the more correct. See `Skeat's Etymological Dictionary.'

Quote: A <i>spell </i> in New Zealand means a period of rest, rather than of work, and `to have a spell' is to take a rest; in this sense it is probably a remnant of the speech of the New Bedford and Nantucket whalers who once frequented New Zealand waters, `spell oh!' being recorded (in <i>Moby Dick </i>, for example) as a call to cease work or strenuous exercise. [fn.] 15. It is thus much older than `l.C. 19-20,' the date given in Partridge,<i> op. cit.</i>, p. 807, and possibly it is many centuries older; cf. <i>The Owl and the Nightingale,</i> l. 258, `lat thine tunge habben spale' where <i>spale </i>is more appropriately translated by `rest' than by Skeat's `turn of work.'
