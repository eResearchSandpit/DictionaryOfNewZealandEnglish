Quote: NEW ZEALAND SMELT <i>Retropinna retropinna</i> Richardson. ... The smelt is the cucumber fish of some localities and the silvery of others. <i>Ibid.</i> 54 In some other localities these young [smelt,<i> Retropinna</i>] are called tuarenga. The half-grown fish is termed tikihemi and the adult paraki. Certain races of fish have a broad silvery band running along the side; hence the term `silvery.' It is to be regretted that in Canterbury the term smelt is still used to apply to the minnow, <i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>.

Quote: The fact demonstrates that the New Zealand waters are peculiarly adopted [sic] for the production of fine fish; and no doubt one reason for this is the superabundance of silveries in some of the streams.

Quote:  <i>Vernacular Name.</i>- Powell [TrNZI 2/84] was the first to point out that two fish were referred to as `smelt' in north Canterbury. These were <i>Galaxias attenuatus </i> and <i> Retropinna retropinna</i>. At present Canterbury residents refer to </> R. retropinna</i> as `silvery,' on account of the silver line running along the side of the half-grown fish. Maoris refer to this `silvery' as `tikihemi,' and to the adult as `paraki.'

Quote: SMELT A common little fish often confused with - and caught with - whitebait. He is the bitter, silver fellow the sharp-eyed whitebaiter discards from his nets. Smells like cucumber, hence one of his other names Cucumber-fish. Also called Silvery. ... Several types of smelt occur around New Zealand - Canterbury, Chatham Islands, Rotorua, Sea Foam, Southland and Stokell's - but it takes a real expert to tell them apart. <i>Ibid.</i>288 SILVERY The bane of professional whitebaiters. This small, silver fellow is usually removed by hand from the catch when he appears not so much because he doesn't taste good but because he looks like a `foreigner'. The Silvery is the young of the smelt ...
