Quote: The Australians have a name for mixed rating systems. They call it `Shandy Rating'. `Shandy' is a mixed drink usually beer and lemonade and shandy rating is a mixture of rating systems such as Unimproved or Land Value rating and Capital or Annual Value rating in one local body area. New Zealand has had `shandy rating' for years in Christchurch and Invercargill for example. ... New Zealand can do without shandy rating.
