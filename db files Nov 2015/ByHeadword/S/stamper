Quote: The carcases are washed and wiped by a <i>wiper,</i> then a <i>stringer</i>, generally a boy, puts strings on the front legs and necks, and they go over to <i>the clock </i>which counts them. The carcases then go to the <i>pusher-up</i> who pushes them along to the scales to be weighed and graded. A <i>stamper</i> stamps the carcases and a<i> ticket-boy</i> puts a grade ticket on them out at the scales after the <i>grader</i> has graded them for weight and size.
