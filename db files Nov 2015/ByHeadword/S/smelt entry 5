Quote:  The only true representative of the <i>Salmonidae </i> is the beautiful little <i>Retropinna,</i> or smelt, two varieties of which at least are found in our rivers and lakes. Somewhat allied to this fish, the graceful upokororo (<i>Prototroctes oxyrhynchus </i>), or native grayling ... is found in many of our streams.
