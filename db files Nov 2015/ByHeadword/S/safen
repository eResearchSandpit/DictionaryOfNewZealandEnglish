Quote: David Gregorie of Waikanae quotes a letter in his local paper from Niki Trotter, of Raumati Beach: "I find it hard to see why anyone would be against safening a very dangerous piece of road with an extremely bad accident history." Now that's a truly marvellous word. "Safen". to "make safe", follows all the best precedents, using that Germanic -en ending to make a verb out of an adjective. It mimics fasten, worsen, harden, sweeten, sharpen, shorten, stiffen etc.
