Quote: At most skimming stations there is no reason why the whole milk should not be pasteurised before separation .. But there are skimming-stations where cold water for cooling purposes is scarce, or even unattainable .. the only other way in the case of a skimming station without water would be to pasteurise the cream on delivery at the main factory.

Quote: Spirits rose again in the next decade with a butter factory, the South Canterbury Dairy company commencing operations in Timaru, and drawing cream from 'skimming stations' in outlying districts. I found that skimming stations were actually creameries and a separator did the work.
