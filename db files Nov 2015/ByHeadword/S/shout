Quote:  <i>Shout, n.</i> to stand treat. (1) Of drink. (2) By transference, of other things. The successful digger used to <i>call</i> passers-by to drink at his expense. The origin may also be from noisy bar-rooms, or crowded bar-parlours, where the man who was to pay for the liquor or refreshment called or <i>shouted</i> for the waiter or barman. When many men drink together the waiter of course looks for payment for the man who first calls or shouts out for him to give him the order. Or is `pay the shout' a variant of `pay the shot,' or tavern reckoning? In its first sense the word has reached the United States, and is freely employed there. [1859]
