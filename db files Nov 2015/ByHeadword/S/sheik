During the run of the picture in Auckland an argument arose over the correct pronunciation, [ i:k] or [ eik], leading to the following limerick (p.p. P.S. Ardern): -->There was a sheek (or a shake), Who was either a freak (or a fake); He took the mayor's daughter Across to Bayswater, And kept her a week (or awake).]
