Quote:  From 1936 to 1938 in <i>The Tramper </i> there are a number of references to `sidling tracks' and `sidling routes'. Towards the end of 1938 comes `after sidling round the head of the said stream', and, a year later, `we sidle the top of Three Johns', and from then on the verb flourishes. In 1940 comes `on a long sidle', and from then on the noun is as common as the verb.
