Quote: Smitch was invented by Geraldine Farmer Gerald Pemberton. Although Mr Pemberton initially came up with the idea so he could activate the farm irrigator pumps from the paddock rather than having to drive back to the pump shed, Smitch uses now range from turning on the electric blanket to activating the electric fence out the back of the farm.
