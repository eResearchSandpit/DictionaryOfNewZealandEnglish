Quote: SNIGGING-TRACKS. ... Good straight tracks make hauling easy. A few pieces of corduroy placed across the track are a great help ... A good snigger will see that a log is not jammed before signalling `Right ahead' to the hauler, and will use his snigging-shoe ... to lift the log out of bad places.
