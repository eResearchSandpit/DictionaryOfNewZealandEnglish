Quote: The comparatively small band of wild horses that haunts the vicinity of the Desert Road is but a shadow of the droves of `scrubs' that roamed the Kaingaroa Plains and adjacent country up to the earlier days of the century. How the herds originated is something of a mystery. As far back as the `seventies the horses were numerous enough, and in the period 1900-1914 they roamed in bands of several hundred. At this time parties of hunters made regular and profitable raids on them.
