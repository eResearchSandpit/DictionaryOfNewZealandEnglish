Quote:  [Colonial slang] When one friend meets another very often the greeting will [135] be, `Are you going to stand `shout'?' in other words, `Are you going to stand drink or `treat'?' If this is agreed to they will adjourn to the nearest inn, or hotels as these poor little match-boxes are called; and in fact there is a great deal of standing `shout' in the Colonies, both in public and in private.
