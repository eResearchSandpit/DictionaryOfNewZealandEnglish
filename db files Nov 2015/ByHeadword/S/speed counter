Quote: Have you noticed how the numbers have increased at speed counters in supermarkets? Ten items of less ... 15 ... Now it's 18... Anyway at the speed counter the other day someone next to me said, "I know you."... By now he was up to item 29, the barcode reader running hot. <i>Speed counter?</i>
