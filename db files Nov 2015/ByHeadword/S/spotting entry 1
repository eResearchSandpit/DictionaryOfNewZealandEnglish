Quote: The runholder was protected against intruders: cottages, fences and homesteads gave him a pre-emptive right over a set number of contiguous acres. Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land - sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years.

Quote: `Gridironing' was the practice of buying twenty acre sections fronting on a road, so spaced as to leave sections of nineteen acres between them, and as these had to be auctioned the small farmer stood litttle chance of outbidding the run-holder who usually retained them without having to purchase them. `Spotting' was buying up key positions, fertile land, and leaving the barren, water courses, entrances to valleys, road lines, ... .

Quote: When investigating the change from pastoral lease to freehold in any locality, the student, brought up on Pember Reeves (see e.g. S.E.I. [State Experiments 1902] 234) searches immediately for evidences of the methods by which the runholder retained his grasp of the land. These practices called gridironing and spotting can be defended: there is no need to do so here. If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it.

Quote: The other and yet more harmful method was to buy isolated sections all over a run to prevent or hinder large purchases by anyone else; to pick out the fertile and leave the barren; to take the grain and leave the husk. This was called `spotting.'
