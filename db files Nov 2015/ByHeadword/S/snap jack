Quote: PIGFISH (PURAMORUA) <i>Congiopodus leucopaecilus </i> (Richardson) ... Many years ago these fish were sold to the public in large numbers but only for a short period when others were exceptionally scarce. The fish were skinned so that they looked quite different from the fish in its natural state. They were then railed to a country town and sold readily under the name of Snap Jacks or Skip Jacks.
