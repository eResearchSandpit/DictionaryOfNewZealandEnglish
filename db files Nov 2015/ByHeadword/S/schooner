Quote: The name `Greymouth Schooner' is not the name of a ship but the designation given to a drinking vessel which is supposed to have a capacity of an imperial pint, or 20 ounces- double the size of the ordinary glass. West Coasters are inordinately proud of their reputation of being able to consume more beer in any given time than those in less favoured parts of the Dominion and support for their contention was forthcoming in the glass that was famed in many a story of the early Coast days as the `Greymouth Schooner' These have almost disappeared from the West Coast hostelries but one has been secured through the generosity of Mr. H.E. Wedde of Oamaru, for the Otago museum. The Museum boasts a particularly fine collection of glassware going back to the days of the early Egyptians and the Director, Dr H.E. Skinner seemed overjoyed that such a famed drinking measure as the `Greymouth Schooner' should find a place in such select company. The claim that the glass provided a full 20 ounces is disputed by Dr Skinner however, who finds that it is only [?] 17.5 ounces.
