They allege that Mr Jerningham Wakefield either did not buy the land or did not give sufficient payment for it .... Four sectionists only have been able to settle on their land; others have attempted, but after some trouble and expense have been driven back to town ....

In the meantime the settlers are condemned to inactivity.
