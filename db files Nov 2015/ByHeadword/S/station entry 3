Quote: A few words may suffice to give the reader a general idea of a station. There was the usual manager's house, with a loft for the accommodation of the hands who preferred it to the woolshed, where the sheep were shorn and the wool [7] packed in bales for transmission home. There was the stockyard, ... besides a hut or two for the shepherds about the run. There were the various out-houses, pigstyes, &c., that are the adjuncts of most dwellings of the better sort in the colonies. cp <i>homestead, outstation</i> (and run)

Quote: A typical station consists of a house [homestead]... Besides the hourse there will be men's quaters scattered about..., a cookhouse with dining room and accommodation for shearers.... The most important outbuilding on the is the place woolshed....Stables, killing house, and cart shed make up the remaining buildings and altogether the place looks quite a little village. <i>Ibid.</i> 11 Sometimes two or even three runs have proved poor investments on their own and they have been thrown together again to be run as one unit.... In that case, there will be a main station and one or two out-stations with huts for musterers and perhaps even a permanent cook or married man.
