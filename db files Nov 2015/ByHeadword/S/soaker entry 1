Notes: Jim writes : Definition from Salmond <i>NZ Houses</i> p. 233. Said (p204) to be an American invention, 1914. The word is not known to me but Salmond implies that it is current - as the device certainly is. NSOD defines <i>soaker</i> (ia) as "a sheet of metal used in roofing to keep out the rain."
