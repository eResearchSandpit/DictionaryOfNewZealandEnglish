Quote:  The strap-toothed whale (</i> Mesoplodon layardi <i> ) is, at least when adult, at once recognized by the two long strap-shaped teeth which, originating from the mandible in front of the hinder end of the symphysis, grow upwards and backwards, eventually curving round the upper jaw and preventing the mouth from being opened beyond a certain distance.
