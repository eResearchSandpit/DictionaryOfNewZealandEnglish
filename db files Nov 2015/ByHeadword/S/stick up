Quote: The loafer who ne'er soils his fingers, And of gold who won't work for an ounce, You'll find in hotels often lingers, And orders a glass on the bounce. And his tumbler with brandy half filling, He'll drink and commence then to skite; And replies when he's asked for the shilling, `Stick it up, you know me, it's all right.'
