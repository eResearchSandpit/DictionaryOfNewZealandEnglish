Quote: As the race has to be wide enough in all cases to admit of the passage of a large full-fleeced sheep, it often happens, in yards constructed on the old plan, that two small sheep get jammed and block up the way; but this becomes an impossibility upon Mr Sutherland's plan, as the sheep next the rollers easily draws a-head of the one next the rails, and therefore comes to the swing gate first.
