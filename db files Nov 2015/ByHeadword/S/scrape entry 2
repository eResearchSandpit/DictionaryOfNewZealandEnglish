Quote: The best kind of flax was the Tihore. The native plan of preparing it was very simple. They tore out the fibres, rubbed them together in their hands to open the bundles, and removed the small tissue that remained by scraping it with their nails. The inferior kind they prepared somewhat differently. They scraped it with a shell, having sometimes previously steeped it in water to soften the skin; they then soaked it in water for from two to four days, heated it with stones while it was wet, and scraped it again, then soaked it again, and then bleached it and dried it on poles ...
