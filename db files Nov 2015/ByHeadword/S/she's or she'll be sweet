The wooden floor's arrived and is in place already. Brian and Mac'll be here any minute now to help put up the tent. You and I can get away now. She'll be sweet. See you tomorrow.' `Wait a bit - the fuse's blown. I'll have to put new fuse wire in. Just a couple of secs. - right you are! She'll be sweet!'
