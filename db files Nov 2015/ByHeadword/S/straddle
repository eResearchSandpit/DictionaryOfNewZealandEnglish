Quote: At ground level, the straddles are bigger than I thought.  Three stories high - surrounded by gigantism I have taken to measuring just about everything against buildings - and weighing 60 tonnes apiece, they have an appealing way of getting about... Straddles are run with the efficiency of worker bees.
