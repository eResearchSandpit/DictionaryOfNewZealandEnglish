Quote: On the 17th July the Commissioners were given a practical demonstation of the patent stripper-slips machine. This machine undoubtedly does its work well, but the Commissioners are of the opinion that stripper-slips are really a form of waste which should be eliminated from the industry. The combined machine improves the colour of the stripper-slips, and afterwards turns them into marketable tow.
