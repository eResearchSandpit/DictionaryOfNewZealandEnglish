Quote: <i>pa[a]ua</i>, a shellfish (Haliotis iris); there are three species (H. rugusoplicata and H. virginea also) but iris is much the most common, and is the one with the red-blue-green opalescence that has made it so popular for use as ornaments, etc., within the last few years: it was exported from the beginning of settlement for the making of buttons, but a rage has set in for the wearing of paua jewellery and the use of paua small goods, ink-stands, serviette-rings, etc., and a new name has been given to it - sea-opal, and its deeper tints are as beautiful as opal if not as durable. The exportation of the shell has now been prohibited, but not the exportation of the manufactured article, so that Newzealand has acquired a distinctive industry
