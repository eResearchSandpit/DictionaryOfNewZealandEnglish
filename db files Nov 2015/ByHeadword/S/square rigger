Quote: Those days they used to call it demi-john - but then they used to call it square rigger... The gin used to come in a square bottle, what they called J.D.K's gin. And they used to use those for square riggers.

Quote: It is not quite certain, at least in the police court, what one should call the bottles which are usually requisitioned for the gentle duty of `running the cutter.' A good old-fashioned name is a `square-face,' but in the court the other day `suqare rigger' was the term used as a proper legal description of the article, while counsel went so far as to call it a `square-rigged bottle.' What's in a name? A J.D.K.Z. bottle will always hold the regulation sixpence worth no matter what it's called.
