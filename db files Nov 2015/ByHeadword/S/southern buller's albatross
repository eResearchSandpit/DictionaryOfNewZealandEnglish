Quote: In keeping with their commanding presence on the wing, on land southern Buller's albatrosses possess an aristocratic mien. Like several other species small albatross (also known as mollymawks) they have dark shadows under their brows, a crescent of dazzling white feathers behind the eyes, subtle shadings of grey over the head and neck and bright slabs of yellow in the bill. The southern Buller's albatross, <i>Thalassarche bulleri</i>, breeds only on the Snares and Solander Island, off the south Fiordland coast, while a closely related species, the northern Buller's albatross, has its breeding headquarters on the Chatham Islands.
