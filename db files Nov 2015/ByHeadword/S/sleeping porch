Quote: Apart from the entrance porch there was often a sun porch off the living room, a back porch off the kitchen.. and a great novelty imported from America along with the fad for healthy living - the sleeping porch. This was really an outdoor room, sometimes at first floor level, where beds were kept in the summer months.
