Quote: He [a sheep dog] was so fast that I'd have him away out, past, and beyond any sheep almost before they knew he was coming. In this way I could get in good slews ... <i>Ibid.</i> 169 <i>Slew</i>: To turn or change the direction in which sheep are travelling. To top-side slew is to turn or hunt them downhill. Slewing is done mainly with huntaways and in one of the huntaways events at our trials - Class III - the sheep are hunted on a zig-zag course. This is often called a slew.
