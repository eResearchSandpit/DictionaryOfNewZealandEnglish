Quote: The strippers are raised on a platform some 6ft high, and the modus operandi is this: The flax is placed into stripper and pulled out from below by a boy.   It is then put into the trough, where there is a continual flow of water, and then taken out and placed on the benches, then carted away to the bleaching and drying grounds.

Quote: In 1867 an Auckland engineer invented a machine which extracted fibre from the flax plant by beating the leaves between two metallic surfaces - a revolving metal drum (equipped with beaters) and a fixed metal bar... This machine (which became known as a 'stripper') heralded the beginning of large-scale production of flax fibre.

Quote: Each stripping machine affords employment to a couple of boys; one of them feeds and the other takes the fibre away; but the company intend having the process so much altered that the flax will be delivered by means of a revolving-table. .. Each stripper will put through about one ton of green flax, producing about 4 cwt. of finished fibre per diem.
