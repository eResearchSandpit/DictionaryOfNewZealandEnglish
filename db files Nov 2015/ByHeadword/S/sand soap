Quote: Our chief subeditor.. has long been bemoaning the fact that you can't get sand soap any more, and wants to know what has happened to it. Fantastic news. If you long to get down on your knees and scrub that concrete doorstep the old-fashioned way or scour your pans without a metal pot scrub, help is at hand.
