Quote: When rivers are low, chinook salmon, known locally as quinnat, linger at sea, waiting for higher flows before running upstream to spawn.<i>Ibid.<i/> 26  Between 1901 and 1907, Ayson made five importations and releases of fry, fingerlings and juveniles, and by 1907 the chinooks (which would became known here as quinnat, another native American name for salmon) were already coming back to spawn... By 1911-1912, quinnat had colonised the Waitaki River system and were spawning as far inland as the Ohau, Pukaki and Tekapo Rivers.
