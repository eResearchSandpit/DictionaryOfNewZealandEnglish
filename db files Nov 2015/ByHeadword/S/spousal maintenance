Quote: Proposed amendments to the Family Proceedings Act will also give a judge the power.. to order the husband (or a de facto partner) to pay the wife (or his/her de facto partner) maintenance money out of his income from the date of their separation till possibly the date of their deaths. Such a payment is called spousal maintenance.
