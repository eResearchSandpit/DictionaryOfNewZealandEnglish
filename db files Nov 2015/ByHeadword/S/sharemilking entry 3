Quote: A feature of dairy-farming in New Zealand has been the development of share-milking, akin to the old French system of me[acute]tayage or the sharefarming common with annual crops such as cotton in the United states of America. Under this system the owner usually provides the land, plant, and herd, while the share-milker provides labour and receives in return one-third to one-half of the gross returns. In other cases the sharemilker also provides the dairy herd and receives two-thirds of the gross receipts.
