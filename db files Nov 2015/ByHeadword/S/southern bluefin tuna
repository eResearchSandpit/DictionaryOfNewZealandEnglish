Quote: Hunting the elusive southern bluefin on mainly small three to four-crew fishing boats is a draining, extremely physical and potentially dangerous business.... Catching southerns and northerns is lucrative but rare and New Zealanbd's 100-plus tuna boats often return to port without landing a big-paying fish... Midway through a six-day trip.. his crew.. are putting in 18-hour days of back breaking work in the southern or, even better, northern blue-fin tuna.

Quote: ALBACORE ... Some confusion reigns as to this fellow's real name. As with many of our fish he has several. His scientific name can either be <i>Thunnus germo</i> or <i>Thunnus Alalunga,</i> depending on which authority you believe. Common names include Southern Bluefin, Longfin-Tuna and Longfin Albacore. <i>Ibid.</i> 266 TUNAS ... Tuna were generally known as `tunny' until the discovery of a potentially big export market to America, where tuna is rated a luxury fish. The name as then changed to conform with that used in America. Since then Southern Bluefin tuna, Yellowfin tuna and Striped, or Skipjack, tuna have been developed into important export fishes. In New Zealand the Albacore has become an important commercial fish. Bible <i>Ibid.</i>  267 [ALBACORE (Thunnus alalunga)] This is the most prized tuna because of the white flesh. The name albacore was used for the Southern Blue fin in some places. <i>Ibid.</i> 268 SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA <i>Thunnus maccoyii</i>: A superbly shaped fish of uniform bluish-black colour above and silvery white below, which migrates south to Foveaux Strait in summer.
