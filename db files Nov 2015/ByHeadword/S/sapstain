Quote: <i>Sapstain </i>Stain in sapwood of timber (usually bluish-black) resulting from the growth of certain fungi that derive their nourishment from the cell contents, e.g. starch, but do not cause the decomposition of the timber. Sapstain commonly develops in the sapwood of freshly sawn unseasoned timber stacked closely so as to be deprived of light and the passage of air, e.g. the hold of a ship.
