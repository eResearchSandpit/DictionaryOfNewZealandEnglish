Quote: Almost 30 years ago Aussie businessman Philip Levy saw a gap in the market for an inexpensive, all-purpose men's short. What else could you get for less than $2 other than a handkerchief or a crass tie in a bargain bin? They were launched in July 1972 and within two days inhabitants of Brisbane, always a place of limited cullture and unlimited heat, had snapped up 50,000 pairs.... The pollution of New Zealand male wardrobes with stubbies began with the first exports in 1977... "The stubby was a cheap short, revolting. They reminded me of rugby shorts only ruigby shorts were more comfortable. They're still out there in country towns... They were revolting, everything exposed. You couldn't afford to sit down in them."

Quote: [Hdg] And they call it Stubbie love... Writer Dianna Dekker called them zipless. Wrong. The sporty Stubbies in your picture had a zip. A very fine zip... What Stubbies did have was class, plenty of ass and a little pocket perfect for keeping change and stones without disturbing your stride - walk, skip or run.

Quote: The tennis gear is a tribute to those 1970 icons of mate attire, stubbies. "Pixie and I had both been to different op shops and without knowing it had bought the same stubbies. To do something with them, we went for a run - just a fitness run - both wearing our stubbies. People were laughing so much we thought we would do it again... Because our stubbies were awfully short we'd stop at intersections and do lunges and stuff.
