Quote: The boys had to turn up to school every Wednesday in military uniform. This was not made out of lightweight material.. but of heavy, prickly serge with polished brass buttons. We called them 'sandpaper suits.'

Quote: Whatever happened to those `sandpaper suits?' - the khaki shorts and battledress tunics worn by thousands of boys during the heyday of the school cadets. Most of the uniforms were manufactured during the Second World War and proved so durable that they were recycled generation of schoolboys. `They were ussued to a cadet, returned at the end of the year, drycleaned and given to another cadet,' said Major Don Stewart. He understood the uniforms went out of use some time in the 1960s.
