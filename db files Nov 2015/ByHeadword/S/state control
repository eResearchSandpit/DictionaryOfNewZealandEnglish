Quote: There is probably no need to ask why, when the bare majority was finally adopted in 1919, a third issue (State Control) was added to the ballot paper, with the permanent effect.. of splitting the anti-trade vote. <i> Ibid. </i>  80 It is certainly true that from 1919 to 1925 the State Control vote was bigger than the difference between the Continuance and Prohibition votes. <i> Ibid</i> 165 The trade's chief complaint against the Bill was that it would be a high road to a "State Control of the trade."

Quote: As a member of that renowned Wai-iti Literary Society, which is responsible for the controversy now being carried on in your columns on that interesting and burning question, "State Control of the Liquor Traffic versus Prohibition," I would sir, in justice to Mr Wright and the other gentlemen who journeyed to Wai-iti to take part in the debate under discussion, to point out that it was quite understood by all concerned that the debate should be of a friendly character, and that no feeling should be shown on either side.
