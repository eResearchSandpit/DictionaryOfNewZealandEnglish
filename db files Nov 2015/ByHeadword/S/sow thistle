Quote: They employ themselves in cutting & selling of firewood at 6d a bundle, in gathering thouthistle for people's goats in the Town, and working at their own potatoe-grounds which they clear - i.e. the forest, by chopping down the wood & laying the brush-wood in winter and then firing it in the heat of summer, and a fine and awful sight it is at night to see their fires running on the ground clearing the hills and plain at once!.
