Quote: SEAPERCH (POHUIAKAROA) JOCK STUART, HIGHLANDER, FIVEFINGER, SOLDIERFISH or SCRODDIE <i>Helicolenus papillosus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) The seaperch is a fish well known to all fishermen both sports and commercial fishermen alike, who give it quite a number of vernacular names, a few of which are as follows: Jock Stuart, Highlander, Fivefinger and Soldierfish. These names have a bearing on some distinguishing characteristic of the fish. For instance the first two names are supposed to be given on account of the colouring of the fish resembling, in some ways, the tartan of a Scot; while Fivefingers is given on account of the so-called five (really more) fingers (rays) of the pectoral fins, on which the fish has a habit of resting on the floor of the aquarium tank. The name Soldierfish is derived from the similarities of this fish to the activities of a soldier or picket on sentinel duty. I have often seen Seaperch stand or, rather, rest at attention on its pectoral fins for lengthy periods. When it did move, it moved to the right or to the left with the precision of a well-trained soldier. The name Scroddie, commonly used at the northern end of the South Island, is derived from the word Scrod which means a young Dogfish. It appears from my researches that when the early colonists first saw a small Seaperch they at once named it Scrod and later the `ie' was tacked on to make Scroddie.

Quote: SEA PERCH (<i>Sebastes percoides</i>). ... `The pohuiakaroa,' Dr. Hector says, `deserves mention, as it represents in these seas the genus to which the Norway haddock belongs. It is one of the most frequent and troublesome fish, caught in a moderate depth of water round the coast, and especially in rocky harbours, being almost worthless as food, and armed with so many sharp spines that it is a difficult task to detach it from the hook. It is the proper sea-perch of these waters.'
