Quote: Who among us can forget our early encounters with biscuits?... Jammy Shrewsburys, with their glorious chewy texture, and Girl Guide biscuits, which one ate in the time-honoured way of nibbling around the rim first, then working methodically towards the central medallion... Following my nose, I soon discovered that the source of the headiest aromas was the jam kettle room, where the gooey fruit filling for Shrewsburys was prepared in large vats.
