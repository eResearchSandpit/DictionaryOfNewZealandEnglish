Quote: To offset these rather gloomy expressions there are those that derive from <i> salubrious.</i>  They are J.D. Pascoe terms and were brought by him from Canterbury to Wellington. They obviously arose from the habit of describing sunny, pleasant weather or places as `salubrious'. First is the <i> salubrium</i> , a rest or sunbake in salubrious conditions. This first appeared in <i> The Tramper</i>  in 1937. About 1939 people were <i> salubriating</i> , or taking a <i> salube</i>  in the sun. The previous year Te Matawai was described as a `salube hut'. By 1943 trampers were sunbathing and <i> salubing</i> . So far as Tararuas are concerned,<i> salube</i>  as a noun and a verb is the word that has survived.
