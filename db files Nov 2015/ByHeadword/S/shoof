Quote: Journal readers will already be familiar with the 'shoof' shoes, designed to protect bandages on the hooves of horses and cattle. One model of interest is the elevated cattle shoof, which is built up on either the right or left side. Shoofs are made from strong urethane material and should last 3 to 6 months if they're used continuously.
