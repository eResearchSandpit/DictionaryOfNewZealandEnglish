Quote: I went up to Ngamatea Station in the spring with a large team of useless 'sooners' except for one handy dog of great ability, named Wonk. ibid. 95 King was a great dog behind sick or slow sheep on a muster, giving them all the time in the world. In fact, while he waited for a seedy sheep to catch up to the string, he'd look like a proper old sooner.

Quote: Dogs of every breed, or any breed, "sooners" and others who have as much pedigree as a chicken raised in an incubator, are permitted to roam on the beaches and swim - the latter when some crank throws a stone or a piece of wood in and tells his puerile pup to "fetchit" - where little children are endeavouring to have the time of their lives.
