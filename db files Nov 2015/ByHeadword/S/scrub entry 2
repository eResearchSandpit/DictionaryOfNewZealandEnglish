Quote: scrub: a group or thicket of bushes too short to merit the title of trees. If they did so, then the copse would be termed bush, not forest. Indeed anything of a woody nature is called scrub, even mountain pine (mountain totara Podocarpus nivalis) which grows quite prostrate, sometimes like a carpet.
