Quote: Through the centre of the yoke, midway between the two bullocks, there was a ring bolt with a double link on the under side. This was called the start, and the bullocks were coupled together by a chain with a hook on each end and approximately 9 foot long (that was the coupling chain). It was hooked into the back link of the start on one pair and the front link of the start of the pair immediately behind them, and so on with the next pair.

Quote:  (bullock yoke term) I yoked up the bullocks. The bullock yoke was a square piece of white pine smoothed and hollowed out to fit the necks of the two bullocks, with holes for the iron bows which went round the neck and through the yoke, being fastened above with a key tied with a bit of greenhide; in the centre a bolt with a ring called `the start' passed through the yoke, to which the chain was fastened from the sledge.
