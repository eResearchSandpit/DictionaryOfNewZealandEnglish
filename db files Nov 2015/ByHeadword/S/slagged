Quote: The relative merits of superphosphate and basic slag for pasture top-dressing are much discussed in certain districts, particularly North Taranaki and North Auckland. Many experienced farmers are firmly of the opinion that slagged pastures have better milk production and fattening capacities than ones treated with superphosphate. How much this may be due to a greater effect from slag, how much to some effect on the mineral content of the herbage, and how much due to management it is impossible to say.

Quote: Every agriculturist knows that it is not customary to place stock on land immediately it has been slagged, but it may be done when the dew has carried the phosphate into the land or immediately after a fall of rain.
