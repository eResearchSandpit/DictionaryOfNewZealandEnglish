The sliding-rod is graduated in inches and half-inches with holes for a pin which has four sides, one for 1 in., another for 1-1/8 in., another for 1-1/4 in., and another for 1-3/8 in. The same pin will make 1-1/2 in., 1-5/8 in., 1-3/4 in., and 1-7/8 in. when used in the second or half-inch set of holes.
