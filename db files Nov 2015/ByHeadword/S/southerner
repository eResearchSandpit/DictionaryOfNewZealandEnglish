Quote: But the north was not respectable. It was the land of lost men. It was peopled with nomads and wasters. And it was `the roadless north', the `barbaric north', where the Maoris still might war upon you in the night. It had no railway beyond Helensville. The Southerner curled his lip at it. [in correct category???]

Quote: Wild Southerner - 'In your last paper you referred to me as a horse-thief, a murderer and a liar.' Editor - 'Well, what was there wrong about that.' Wild Southerner - 'I don't see why you want to blast a man's reputation with a statement like that. I may be, as you claim, a horse-thief and a murderer, but, thank Heaven, sir, I am no liar!'
