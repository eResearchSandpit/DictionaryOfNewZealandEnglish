Quote:  ... he had won through a gale with food and medecine for a camp where two men were ill. He had had to ... row up a creek, and then walk over a mile on a vague bush track ... The slab door of the camp was unbarred by a man who expected some suppliant for shelter, but when he saw Allen he stared as at a ghost.
