Quote: He [sc. Fowler] has scab at Tophouse and has neither the capital nor the skill to keep country like the Rainbow clean.<i>IBid.</i> 70 Scab is caused by a mite (not an insect, but a relation of spiders). The eggs are laid on the skin at the base of the wool fibres. The young mites puncture the epidermis and suck lymph. Small pustules develop from which a liquid exudes, coagulating to form a hard, pale-yellow crust, the scab. ... Infected sheep rub against rocks, posts ... and will bite at the skin, causing serious damage to the wool. ...Some flocks were affected as early as 1848, the Nelson area having serious trouble for many years after that.
