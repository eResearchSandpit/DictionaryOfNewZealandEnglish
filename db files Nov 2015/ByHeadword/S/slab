Quote: Another important [trout] food was a small mollusc ... of which no less than 140 were counted in the stomach of a `slab' taken at Rotorua. ... A considerable number of the trout examined were definitely `slabs'. The slabby condition appeared to be due not only to the usual poor health of the fish for some months after spawning had taken place, but more definitely to both semi-starvation and indigestion.

Quote: But of course lots of the fish are "slabs" that should be returned because they are not the best eating.
