Quote: GRIFFIN'S SILVERFISH <i>Seriolella amplus</i> (Griffin) ... In 1928 the late L. T. Griffin, described and figured a new species of  fish, very closely related to the Warehou (<i>Seriolella brama</i>) and Silverfish (<i>Seriolella punctata</i>), from specimens caught by hand lines in a rocky locality near Mayor Island, Bay of Plenty. This species probably replaces the Silverfish in our Northern waters.
