Quote: The New Zealand Government was trying to resist the inevitable. It deplored the Balfour report, which defined Great Britian and the Dominions as `autonomous communities. . .equal in status' ... It sniffed at the Statute of Westminister, which brought the legal position of the Dominions into conformity with their practical status. <i>Ibid.</i> 291  In 1947 the Statute of Westminister was at last adopted, giving legal fulfilment to the fact of sovereignty.
