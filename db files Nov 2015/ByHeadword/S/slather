Quote: On the 28th of this month, Gisborne stoush lovers will have another bonzer night, when the Gisborne Association will bring Bert Lowe and Bill Bartlett together. These two are scheduled to slather for fifteen rounds, but this is not going to be nearly all the fun. Viv Lowe and Poesy will try to deal out oblivion to each other during six rounds, while Mellow and Heany and also Harrison and Frurie will put up their 'dukes'.
