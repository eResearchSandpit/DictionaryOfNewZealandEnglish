Quote: We named it silver-eye, on account of the ring of white silky feathers around each of its eyes, and blight-bird because of its useful habit of eating the woolly aphis on apple trees. The Maoris named it tau-hou, which means stranger... There was a paternal veto against killing the white-eye.

Quote: I wonder if people are aware that most of our birds do migrate.  For instance, we have in the winter time such birds with us as the yellow hammer, the little black fantail, and the silver eye, and, as far as my judgement goes, they are not to be found in the colony in the summer time.
