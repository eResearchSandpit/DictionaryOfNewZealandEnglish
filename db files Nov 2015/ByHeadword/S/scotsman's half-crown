Quote: A row of oyster bottles - like glass pickle-bottles - in the fish-shed, was the first `bank', but depositors put their coins into these bottles not for themselves ... The bottles were labelled `Pennies', `Church Mice' (that was the threepence), `Bobs' (the shillings) and `Scotsman's Half-Crown (the florin).
