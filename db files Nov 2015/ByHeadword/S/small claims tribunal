Quote: There arte 36 Small Claims Tribunals in New Zealand and full nationwide coverage is expected by the end of this year. Their basic objective: to provide a low-cost, speedy resolution of disputes involving sums of up to $1000. The means to this end: low filing fees, no strict adherence to the rules of evidence, the use of referees who are not necessarily legally qualified, and restricted grounds for appeal.
