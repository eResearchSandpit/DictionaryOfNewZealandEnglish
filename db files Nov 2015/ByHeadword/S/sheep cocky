Quote: (A) a cocky is a New Zealand FARMER. These come in several varieties: cow cockies (ranchers) tend to be the only ones who rate a modifier to the cocky, but there are also men who you could describe as sheep cockies, dairying cockies, horticultural cockies and mixed cockies. A Kiwi would, however, leave off the descriptive words for all but the cow cockies.
