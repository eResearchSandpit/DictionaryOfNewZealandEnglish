Quote: Sensible too is the wine list - eightchampagnes/methode champenoises, 12whites, 10 reds, and five of what haverecently become known, childishly in myopinion, as "stickies".
Notes: [This term has been round a while in thewine columns but the only overseas use Ican find is in the Bloomsbury Dictionaryof Contemporary Slang 1990 "Sticky nBritish a liqueur. The word (like theobject in middle-class and 'society'usage) is occasionally extended to referto sweet wines". Not in any of my Aussiereferences.]
