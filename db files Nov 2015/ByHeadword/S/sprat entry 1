Quote: MULLET, YELLOW-EYED (a) Scientific name: <i>Aldrichetta forsteri.</i> (b) Suggested commercial name[s]: Sea Mullet; New Zealand Kipper (smoked); Rollmops (pickled). (c) Other common names: Herring (in error and best dropped); Common Mullet; Sprat (in error). (d) Principal localities where taken: Tauranga, kaipara, lake Ellesmere. ... The name `Herring' has been applied widely and for a long time to the New Zealand Yelloweyed Mullet which is not a Clupeid and therefore only very distantly related to the true Herring of European waters.

Quote: HERRING More often than not a Yelloweye Mullet, but the fish that is widely known as the `herring' in our coastal waters. Also known as `sprat', though this term also covers the young of several species including anchovy, yelloweye mullet and several other small fish. There are only two, `true' herrings in our waters. <i>Ibid.</i>164 The Yellow-Eye has a much narrower head than the Grey and is the ubiquitous, but misnamed `sprat' or `herring' of our wharves. <i>Ibid.</i>243 SPRAT: <i>see Yellow Mullet </i>
