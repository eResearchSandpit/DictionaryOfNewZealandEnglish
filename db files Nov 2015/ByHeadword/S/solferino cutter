Notes: Beryl Hughes (20 Scapa Terrace, Karori, ph. 4760-236) saw these so labelled in the Kitchen Shop at Ruth Pretty's Te Horo catering establishment. She thinks it logically should mean something that cuts Solferinos, but Solferino was an 1859 Italian Battle and is also the colour of rosaniline, named after the battle, neither of which seems relevant to a kitchen applicance.
