Quote:  BONITO Offshore anglers use bonito fillets for snapper bait and deep-sea anglers claim its dark-red flesh attracts almost every sporting fish up to shark and marlin. It is known as Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Skippy, Skipper and Skipjack because of its habit of breaking the surface when feeding. The name `Skipjack' has also been applied however to at least half-a-dozen other species.
