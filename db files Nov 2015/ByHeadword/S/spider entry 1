Notes: The only light the miners [at Waihi's Martha goldmine c1907] had to work by were candles, held in place by what was known as a `spider'. It had one sharp prong and a hook so that it could be either hung on the side of the quartz face or driven into the logs used for timbering the sides and roof of the tunnel. [No source]
