Quote: While passing in front of a hut [at the whaling station], I was invited to visit a sailor who lived within, and who had had a bad leg for many years, which rendered him unfit for any other work than that of signal man. While the rest of his companions were actively engaged in the boats, he was carried every day during the season to the summit of the most projecting point of the cliff, where he sat under a shed, glass in hand, to look out for whales. By means of a mast and yard, and some signals, he was able to give notice to the boats in whatever direction he discovered a whale; and so earned a small share in the fortunes of the fishery.
