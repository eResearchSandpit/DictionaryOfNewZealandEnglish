Quote: New Zealand boasts four endemic waders not found elsewhere in the world. These are the black stilt, now limited to a few pairs nesting on high ground in the centre of the South Island; the shore plover, confined entirely to a small island off the Chathams, where its numbers are fairly strong; and the New Zealand dotterel, red-breasted in summer, rather curiously nesting in two discrete groups, one in the Hauraki Gulf, the other far away at and around Stewart Island.
