Quote: Inspectors were posted on all the main motor roads, and every motorist was pulled up and asked to produce his license.   Some did, quite a few did not, and names and addresses were taken in those uncomfortable black notebooks which inspectors and others carry.   Each car was marked by a small sticker by the inspector in order that it should not be stopped again by another inspector, but there was one driver who objected strongly to stickers, small, large, and of any colour, and before his afternoon's drive was ended he had been pulled up four times, duly noted in the black book, and presented with a sticker at each stop.

Quote: Those who hold that the existing car parking regulations would work quite satisfactorily if only they were enforced can have no complaint over the activities of traffic inspectors in the central business area yesterday afternoon, for "stickers" were applied to windshields in right generous fashion.
