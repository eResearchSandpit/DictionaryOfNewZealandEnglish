Quote: The fact that he'd . . . `stuck fat' earned Trevor a lot of respect from the men of the prison. It was a powerful injunction at Paremoremo . . . that irrespective of what happened, you never told a screw about it. <i>Ibid.</i> 118 Brian . . . was spewing on them for it and all morning was calling out across the compound, saying they were eggrolls and lashers and weaklings, for failing to stick fat.
