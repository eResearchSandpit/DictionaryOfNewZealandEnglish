Quote: Steve Braunias's disparaging treatment of the Semple tank.. is regrettable because his mirth obscures the vehicle's many visionary qualities. A more thoughtfdul evaluation reveals the tank's iconic form and use of local materials to be a bold and witty precursor of Don Driver's installations and use of otherwise familiar "found objects", and of Jeff Thompson's skill in wrapping cultural artefacts in corrugated iron.
