Quote:  In those days racism was more blatant than it is now. ... I had become accustomed to being addressed as `snow', `darky', and even `Hori', often by adults who would have been surprised had they known they were giving offence. And at high school Stuart was known as Sam (short for Sambo). But `nigger' was the ultimate, the unforgivable epithet.
