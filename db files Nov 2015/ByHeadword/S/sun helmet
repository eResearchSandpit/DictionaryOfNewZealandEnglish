Notes: Jim writes : NSOD defines this as a cork etc helmet formerly worn by whites in the tropics. Macquarie 1981 is similar., (Not in Collins). But I recall it from the 30s (and later?) as the name for a child's cloth sunhat made with an extension at the back to protect the neck. I have found no citations, however. DEH adds: I remember these. I think they disappeared when troops returned from the Middle East and the cult of protection from the sun gave way to the cult of the sun. They may now have returned, judging by photos of primary school children wearing similar headwear.
