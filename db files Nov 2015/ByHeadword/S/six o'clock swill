Quote: Sir, - Like the great majority of New Zealanders who finish work at 5 or 5.30 p.m. I like two or three beers and a chat to my friends before I go home for dinner. That is when I feel like a drink, and when I enjoy it. They call it the `six o'clock swill,' but we enjoy it. After all, when service is required by so many at the same time, there must be a crush.

Quote: When licensing laws were relaxed in 1989, and again in 1999, to allow the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and, it turns out, dairies, the changes were supposed to reflect a new, more mature, attitude to drinking. Unfortunately, the attitude of some is unchanged from the days of the 6 o'clock swill; they just don't have to travel as far to buy alcohol.
