Quote: SPOTTY (PAEKIRIKIRI)<i> Pseudolabrus (Lunolabrus) celidotus </i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 275] The name Spotty is derived from the presence of spots on each side of the fish. The name Butterfish used in the North Island for them is from the yellow or buttery colouring on the undersurface. In Canterbury they are called Guffy, but for what reason I have yet to learn. It is a very pretty fish, more especially when seen in the water.

Quote: Parochialism runs strong in most of us, and many will note indignantly the absence of a familiar local name. The difficulty is that Stewart Island butterfish = Wellington spotty, while Wellington butterfish=Stewart Island greenbone. <i>Ibid.</i> 224 Family LABRIDAE (wrasses) ... are known by various local names: spotties, soldiers, kelp fish, parrot fish, etc. <i>Pseudolabrus celidotus </i>, a sandy black-marked fish common about wharves, is well known to small boys with bent pins, and to older fishermen whose bait it nibbles.

Quote: SPOTTY (<i>Labrichthys bothryocosmus</i> ). ... [92] According to Mr. Thompson's observations, the spotty is also known in Dunedin as the butter-fish, as when writing in 1877, he said: `The spotty, or butter-fish of our local fishermen, has been very plentiful this year, and had been brought to town in large numbers at times; was in the market 128 days, as against thirty-four days for last year.' ... adding in the most tantalizing manner possible, `There are two sorts of spotty - a big and a little.' And then, after saying the fishermen called them kelp-fish, writes: `Spotties in market 154 days'
