Quote: A significant part of our problem is the deliberate PC use of the term "students" to give children an inflated idea of their own importance and standing... School children are not students. They are pupils, attending classes in an orderly fashion to be taught things. They will become students only when they leave the school system and go on to study at the university or some other institution.

Quote: Lynne King.. quotes the Collins Concise Dictionary in her defence of the strange New Zealand practice of calling school children students instead of pupils... Pupils creep like snails, unwillingly to school, with their satchels, to be taught by teachers, generally at public expense. Students go to university of technical college because they want to. They study under tutors and they pay for the privilege (eventually).
