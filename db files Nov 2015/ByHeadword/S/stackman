Quote: It seems to me that the stackman on a threshing mill has a particularly hard time of it - most work and least pay. ... Under the old rules one stackman has to go on one of the four drays and the cocky sends the other three men ... There is not much but hard work in threshing for the stackman - especially in stook threshing.
