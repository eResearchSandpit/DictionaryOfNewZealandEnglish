Quote: But "SMGP", like most of the new acronyms sprouting from policy land, is pompous enough to bamboozle and alienate those it's supposed to help. Whatever SMGP-type remedy it takes, the work of state social workers, and their information pooling with schools, police, doctors and other pikestaff-plain-red flag points for child abuse, needs fixing.
