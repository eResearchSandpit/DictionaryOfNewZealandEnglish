Notes: Jim Cameron writes : This is not specifically recorded in DNZE but is referred to under the entry <i>block</i>. A block is a primary division of a survey district; a <i>section</i> (among many other meanings) is the usual secondary division. Eg "section 12, Block IV, Tiffin Survey District". See also <i>deposited plan</i>.
