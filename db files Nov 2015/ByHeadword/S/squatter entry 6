Quote: The Wairarapa settlers are uneasy about their tenure ... At present they are the lessees of the Ngatikahunu [sic] ... The sort of contract which the squatters make with the natives is void by the Common Law, for the `Queen' is the only source of title. At Common Law therefore the lease is a mere nullity. The Courts would refuse to look at it. But by an ordinance it is now a punishable misdemeanour to deal with the natives without licence. The Wairarapa squatters must move off if the Governor choose to give them notice.

This is detrimental to the legitimate farmer and owner of the land - making it impossible to compete with parties who have never paid anything.
