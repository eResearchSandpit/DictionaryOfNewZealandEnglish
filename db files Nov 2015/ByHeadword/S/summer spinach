Quote:  `Discovered in Cook's first voyage by Sir Joseph Banks, and was boiled and eaten as greens by the crew.' CTN, p. 183 <i>Tetragonia expansa </i> summer spinach -->[?is this Andersen] Among the useful plants to which we are indebted to New Zealand, we must not forget their summer spinach (T. expansa), which was discovered in Cook's first voyage by Sir Joseph Banks, and `was boiled and eaten as greens' by the crew. It was afterwards seen by Forster at Tangataboo, though it was not used by the natives; but Thunberg found the Japanese aquainted with its value as a pot-herb. It was introduced into Kew Gardens in 1772; but the first account of it as a vegetable worthy of cultivation was published ... in the Annales d'Agriculture for 1809. [Craik is often quoted on this matter: e.g. in 1841 Ward Information Relative to NZ 49.]
