Quote: Washing consisted of two separate operations the first of which was called `soaking' The soak was a sort of bath about twenty feet long by ten wide, let into the ground beside a creek and bricked at the sides to prevent loose earth falling in. It was filled and kept full  by water flowing in through a two-inch pipe and a supply of boiling water was kept handy ... Soap and sometimes ammonia were added to it. After the sheep were let out of the soak When soaked and drained the sheep were driven to a creek, tipped in and washed.
