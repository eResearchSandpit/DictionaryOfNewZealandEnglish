Quote: Kowhai (scarlet) ..... <i>O</i>. Leguminosae; <i>G</i>. Clianthus; <i>S.</i> C. puniceus. `One of the most beautiful plants known.' Long fringes of crimson flowers, like lobster-claws (boiled), or in the natives' eyes, parrots' bills, so they call it <i>`gnutu-kaka'</i> [sic] the parrot-billed.
