Quote: DROSERA. (<i>Linn.</i>) The Sundew ... one can scarcely examine a plant without finding the wings and legs of insects, on one or more of the leaves. ... This extremely interesting genus is represented in New Zealand by six species, all of which are said to digest meats, and are known to [142] the settlers as `Fly-catchers'.

Quote: [Caption] Sundews (<i>Drosera</i>,..) are tiny carnivorous plants found in boggy ground. Sticky droplets on the hairy red leaves ensnare small insects, which the plant consumes using its enzymes... One often sees the carcasses of small insects caught in their leaves - a grim clue as to how these plants get their nitrogen and phosphorus.
