Quote: Frank Rennie's name is closely associated in New Zealand military history with the formation of the Special Air Service Squadron (SAS)... The nine chapters that follow, describing the SAS squadron's arduous operations in the Malayan jungle, form the core of the book and provide a unique and detailed appraisal of SAS tactics and interaction with communist terrorists.
