Quote: It sometimes takes up to half an hour to scramble through the rough gullies to where the dogs have the pig stuck up. If the bulldog were released before reaching the quarry, he would `go in' at once, and would probably be exhausted with holding the pig before we could get there, and possibly get killed.
