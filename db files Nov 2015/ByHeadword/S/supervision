Notes: Jim Cameron writes : It subjects the offender to the oversight and control of a probation officer. <i>Supervision</i> in England is primarily a welfare order placing a child under local authority or probation officer supervision, although it may also be an adjunct to a suspended sentence. Note that the term <i>probation order</i> is no longer used in NZ, but <i>probation officer</i> is, and that <i>pre-sentence report</i> corresponds to the English <i>social inquiry report</i>.
