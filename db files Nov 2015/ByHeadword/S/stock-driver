Notes: ???? `Dream of Shagroon' [title] I saw men of another aspect arrive at the pilgrim-land. ... The Pilgrims looked with contemptuous eye on this people of strange aspect and impure blood, and did despise them. ... I awoke - and lo! the land which was to have been sacred to the orthodox foot only of a `body of English gentlemen', was in possession of the `stragglers, the whalers, and the stock-drivers from other settlements'. Alas! for the goodly land, - the land of the Canterbury Pilgrims.
