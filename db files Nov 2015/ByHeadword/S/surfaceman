Quote: Within a few miles of Lawrence, I noticed two surfacemen just emerging from their homes - about half-past nine - apparently traversing the locality in search of something to do, while the condition of the roads was such that they need not have gone ten yards without finding an abundance of scope for their energies. A lttle further on two other surfacers were at work, with overcoats comfortably buttoned up to the chin, pretending to rake gravel into the wheel-ruts on a new-made piece of road.
