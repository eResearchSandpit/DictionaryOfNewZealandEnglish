Quote: In the year 1852 the initial discovery of gold in Hauraki, if not in New Zealand, was made at Coromandel; and from that date up to the present time this centre has experienced all the ups and downs which inevitably attend the mining of veins, of the bonanza or `specimen stone' type. ... In Ohinemuri ... where even the best ore carried but a few ounces of gold to the ton, instead of as at the Thames, `specimen stone' valued at ounces to the pound.
