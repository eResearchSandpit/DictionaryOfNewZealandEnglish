Quote:  `Not heard in recent (post-war) years because so few turn up now for a day or two's work. Originally many seamen or temporarily out-of-work watersiders came to the Railways for fill-in jobs' perhaps the origin is suggested by (stringer bird)

Quote: `No! they'll never try to help you, / And they show it everyone. / As they sit upon the stringer / While the stop-work meeting's on. / What a study ! Let us paint it / As the seagulls fly about/ While the stringer birds are anxious / For the meeting to come out. / And the `pannikins' are gathered / Round their rostrums, one by one, / To complete the picture - `Waiting!' / While the stop-work meeting's on' that is, non-union labour (? scabs) who <i>would</i> not join the Union and who sat on the stringers during meetings etc; or perhaps after Compulsory Unionism, sat wating for jobs to turn up like seagulls waiting for scraps.
