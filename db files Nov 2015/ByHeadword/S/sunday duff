Quote: And this, too, to colonials who had known most of them what it was to hunger and thirst after "damper" or "johnnycake" warranted to stay by a man for three days at a stretch! - to long vehemently for Maori hen only three removes from a watertight boot soaked in hair oil! - who knew most of them what it had been to partake of '"Sunday duff " boiled in a kerosine tin.
