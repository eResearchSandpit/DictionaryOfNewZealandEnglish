Notes: [The NZ senses, if not variants of imported Austr (cf P. above) would seem to be orig. associated with, if not originated in, the racing slang: (phs cleaning the bookmaker's slate): scrubbed or scrub (a horse) to have lost; be scratched: or scratch. But the senses also parallel those of words with similar meanings: to wipe (off) (a person or thing), get wiped; wash out (sthg), a wash-out; to write off (sbdy or sthg), a write-off. The word seems noticeable after WW2, so perhaps it was popularised by NZ servicemen who may have picked it up from British Servicemen (or Australians): cf P.4. The connotation of contempt may have derived in part by association with SCRUB n and aj `poor, mean' etc, scrubby etc; and the particular uses of this in Australasia: scrub-bull; scrubber, scrub along.]
