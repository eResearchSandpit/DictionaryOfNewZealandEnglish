Quote: Apparently the "sowser" worships at the shrine of four gods: drink, gambling, pleasure and display. The "sowser," explained Mr [L.M.] Isitt was loyal, but while he loved his country he loved his stomach better. Then the "sowser" was a somewhat vain animal - in fact, it was deluded into the idea that one can make a silk purse out of a "sowser's" ear. The "sowser" was also distinguishable for his implacable hatred of the "wowser" and manifested this on various occasions in porcine grunts. The "sowser" further was given to quoting poetry, having a particular weakness for Burns, which he quoted so long as it suited him.
