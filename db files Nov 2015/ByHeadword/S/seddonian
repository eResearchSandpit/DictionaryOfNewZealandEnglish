Quote: Lord Plunket's arrival in New Zealand was signalised by a remarkable piece of stage-management on the part of the late King Dick Seddon. Had there been any interval between the departure of Lord Ranfurly and the arrival of Lord Plunket, Chief Justice Sir Robert Stout would have been sworn in as Acting-Governor. Mr. Seddon and Sir Robert were old political rivals. "King Dick" was determined that Sir Robert should not be his "boss" even for twenty-four hours. He therefore so aranged matters that when Lord Ranfurly was steaming out of the harbour of Wellington Lord Plunket was steaming in. The episode was unique, but quite Seddonian.
