Quote: The first morning I instructed him on how to sharpen and care for his slasher, and how to 'scrub' or cut the small undergrowth. The following morning I told him to carry on with the 'scrubbing' while I got on with the chopping. After I had nearly been smothered several times by falling limbs I sent him back to his scrubbing. Normally a man can scrub enough in one day to last a week's chopping, but within a few days I was right "on his hammer."
