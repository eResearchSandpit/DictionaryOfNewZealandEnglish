Quote: While we were at the township [in Otago, c1862 March], one of our acquaintances came to me and told me there was a man in a disreputable shanty, that had plenty of money and would I come and put him up? Now the Wetherstone diggings were very quiet, so that I objected to men being put up and let go to alarm the place - for I anticipated robbing this banker sooner or later, and that would do me.
