Quote: Sand breaks have one thing in common and that is that they are difficult to heal. One of the earliest methods of dealing with sand breaks was to cover them with branches of boxthorn in the days when hedges were cut with slash hooks. The present method of dealing with large sand breaks is to fence them off entirely from stock and allow them to regenerate.
