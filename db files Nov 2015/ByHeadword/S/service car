Quote: The Coromadel to Thames service car went over a  bank at Lynch's Hill yesterday, where the drop is said to be 80ft, and overturned four times landing wheels up on the beach. The driver was shaken and one passenger rendered unconscious, whilst another, a well known commercial man, had three ribs broken. A lady passenger had a broken collar bone, a child escaping unhurt and uninjured. They were all removed to the Coromandel Hospital.

Quote: I should explain that a service car is well named, and is used for everything. This one wasa type of lorry, with seats at the back, and it collected children for school, took in the mail, collected the cream cans, brought out parcels or luggage, and was used as a bus by any would-be travellers.

Quote: He told me of an odd New Zealand phenomenon, the service car. A cross between a taxi, bus and freight truck, these big cars plied their trade on country roads gathering together the various threads of rural society. Usually soft-topped, and with low doors for easy access, service cars were common throughout the country in the 1920s and 30s.
