Quote: <i>Sheep dog</i>.- Dog to work sheep; <i>collie</i> (q.v.). <i>S.ds</i>. run naturally either to bring sheep towards you or to drive them away; and when a puppy shows his preference he is broken in for that work. The dogs that bring sheep are called <i>heading ds.</i> (q.v.) and most of these can be taught to<i> lead </i>(q.v.) if desired. Dogs which take to driving sheep away are broken in to<i> huntaway</i> and are called <i>htwys</i> (q.v.). Some dogs will both <i>hd</i>. and <i>htwy</i> and are called <i>handy ds.</i> They are not generally high-class heading dogs but very useful about hand and sometimes very useful mustering dogs. Some men have a special<i> slewing d.</i>, but a well-trained, <i>hdg</i>. dog or <i>htwy</i>. will usually <i>slew </i>(q.v.). (C.)
