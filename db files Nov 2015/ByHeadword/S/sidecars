Quote: A misunderstanding over what the game `sidecars' meant led to one youth leaning most of his body out of a car's passenger window while the car's driver tried to drive as close as possible to a parked car, the Wellington Coroners Court heard yesterday.... `When the deceased had asked me if I had done sidecars I thought he meant side-swiping cars,' Beattie said.
