Notes: An Australian lexicographer points out there is a difference between most dictionary definitions and what the public see as a shellfish; likewise in NZ the fishery regulations define for their convenience shellfish as including, from memory, crayfish, sponges and possibly even sea-grass. The sensible thing would be to redefine using as the basic definition the scientific one. The present OED definition is: Any animal living in water whose outer covering is a shell, whether testaceous, as an oyster, or crustaceous, as a crab. This wording is followed by Random House and Macquarie whereas the general public and scientists tend to think of a shellfish as a member of the class Mollusca, i.e. mostly animals with a hard calcareous shell or shells.
