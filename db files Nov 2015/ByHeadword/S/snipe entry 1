Quote: A `ropey' will learn to `snipe' ... which is a highly-skilled operation. Butt-end of clean-trimmed log is trimmed of angles. Vees are cut at points opposite each other at the butt-end (usually) and are connected by a chopped Dee which runs around in a semi-circle from one to the other. In the Dee is laid a `strop', a short length of cable with an eye in each end. The eyes are connected with each other and to a short chain by a shackle; and the chain is attached to `the rope' with a hitch.

Quote: In order to prevent the log from `biting' into uneven ground, and enable it to slip over minor obstacles, it was `sniped' - that is, somewhat rounded or tapered at the front.

Quote: After the logs were cut, each was sniped. To snipe a log, the end is chipped all the way round so that it can be handled without catching humps in the ground, stumps and so on; in fact you might say that a log when it is sniped looks rather like the blunt end of a whale.

Quote: The front end of the log was carefully `sniped', that is, its sharp edge was rounded to allow it to skid like a sledge-runner.

Quote: First of all they tapered one end, rounding the log so that it would be able to slide over impediments in its path, because it had to be dragged along the ground. Now these men were called `snipers', and having sniped the log, they then made two cuts, one on each side of the log opposite each other, right into the rounded part - the sniped end. That was for the purpose of holding a heavy chain which attached the log to the yoked bullocks ...
