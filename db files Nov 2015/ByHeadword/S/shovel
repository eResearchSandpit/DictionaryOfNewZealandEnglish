Quote:  Christian John Taylor has fallen on evil times in Canterbury. He arrived in God's Loan Country from South Africa Boer War time, and industry being crowded out just then, he tried journalism. He was connected with Ashburton `Guardian' for a while and became the proud proprietor of the Ellesmere `Guardian,' but if a man wants to burn money a newspaper is the thing to do it with, and Taylor filed his `shovel.'
