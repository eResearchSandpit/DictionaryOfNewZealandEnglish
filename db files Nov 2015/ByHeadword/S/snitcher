Quote: It was Brixton's habit, this talking to himself, a long monologue which reproduced the slang of forty years ago. Sometimes ... he might ... tell about some bloke he had a snitcher on, or some joker [30] with the bad habit of poking borax, or he might work a slinter if you gave him half the chance.

Quote: Sirs: Your `Housewife' has apparently taken a `snitcher' on us schoolteachers - largely, I suggest, over the anything but usual behaviour of one of us, but does she refuse to buy meat because one butcher gave her short weight?

Quote: It was Brixton's habit - talking to himself, a long monologue which reproduced the slang of forty years ago. Sometimes in the company of somebody younger he might for a change talk it out loud, tell about some bloke he had a snitcher on, some joker who would work a slinter if you didn't watch out - or he might start poking borax.

Quote: It was true that he had accused her of misconduct with another man. This was due to a story 'somebody had pitched into him'. He was perhaps silly for taking any notice of it, as the man might have had a 'snitcher' on him and was trying to 'put it across him'.
