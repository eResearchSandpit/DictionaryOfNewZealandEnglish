Quote: Anyone who had ever been about old whaling and sealing stations must have seen collections of round smooth stones of various sizes but mostly about the size of cannon-balls, lying on the beach. On asking any of the `old hands' what these are, you will at once be told that they are `seal's ballast' ... You will probably be gravely told that the seal is a migratory animal, and that when it is about to take a long journey it will trim itself to exactly the proper weight for long and easy locomotion through the water. It picks up one of these stones and swallows it and goes into the water to try the effect. If it finds it requires more ballast it comes ashore again and repeats the dose. If it has too much weight .... it vomits one or two of the stones out on the beach. Hence the stones are always termed `seals' ballast'
