Quote: The first drill in mining was a rock drill which the miners nicknamed the `Slogger'. ... Two men usually worked at the face of the mine, one holding the drill, the other striking it with a sledgehammer. The drill was shaped like a chisel at one end, and with each hit the person holding it would turn it around.
