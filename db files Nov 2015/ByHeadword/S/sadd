Quote: The future of anti-drink group Sadd is uncertain despite last-minute funding which has thrown the student lobby group a six-month lifeline. Students Against Driving Drunk, which has operated in New Zealand schools for 17 years, received $75,000 from the Road Safety Trust on Thursday.... Sadd operates in more than 80% of Kiwi high schools and is run mostly by students. It aims to raise awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving.
