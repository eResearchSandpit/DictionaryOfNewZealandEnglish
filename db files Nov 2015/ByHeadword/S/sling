Quote: And unless the rule is rewritten it would appear licence holders are forbidden to accept slings or to be paid for newspaper tipping columns... If a driver told an owner, or his friend or partner, how he thought his horse would go (or went the previous week) and that person later slung the driver, on the face of it, the  rule was breached. "It must be accepted by HRNZ that for years drivers, trainers and stablehands have accepted by way of a gift a benefit for having provided information."

Quote: How's this for confidence? An owner of a horse racing at Pukekohe on Saturday told a jockey what his `sling' would be for winning. This is the norm, of course. But this fellow told the jockey two races before his steed was to run. The horse was successful and easily too.
