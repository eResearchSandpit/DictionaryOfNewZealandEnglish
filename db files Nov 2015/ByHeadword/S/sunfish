Quote: But landing the big one is rare, and curses are heard loud and clear when a heavy line gets gaffs in hand and hearts beating, only for a huge but worthless sunfish to be hauled to the surface... Sunfish are almost invariably alive, despite being hooked for hours on end, and are cut free. "They've got a big, floppy fin and look you right in the eye and while they get our hopes up and are a real hassle, I still love them," Mr Kerr said.
