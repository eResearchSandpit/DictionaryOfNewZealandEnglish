Quote:  TOPE OR SCHOOL SHARK <i>Notogaleus rhinophanes</i>  (Peron) The origin of the vernacular name Tope is not certain, but local fishermen who followed this occupation in Britain, said this name is a corruption of `top' in allusion to its well-known habit of following the lines to the top of the water and then snatching off Whiting or other hooked fish in full view of the helpless fisherman. Other New Zealand common names are Southern Tope and School Shark.

Quote: SCHOOLSHARK Not unlike a larger version of the Gummy shark (who grows to about four feet) the Schoolshark gets up to about eight feet and inhabits our [225] coastal waters ... The flesh, like that of the gummies, is quite edible and regularly marketed, usually at Lemonfish. The Schoolshark is usually dark-grey-green above and white below. Known also as Tope and Sand shark they are the only fish who close their eyes when they sleep.
