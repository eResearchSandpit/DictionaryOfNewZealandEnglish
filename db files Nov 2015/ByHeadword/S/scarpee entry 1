Quote: This fish [scorpion-fish <i>Scorpaena cruenta</i>] is the common scarpee of Cook Strait and the cobbler of Napier. Wellington Maoris call it ngutoro or puraruraru ... The cobbler differs from the sea-perch in having more pronounced ridges on the head ..

Quote: [The Red Rock Cod], is also known as the `Common Scarpee' and in Napier it is known as the `Cobbler' Perhaps `Cobbler' would be the best to use for this fish, but it is unfortunately not known under this name outside Napier. The name Red Rock Cod is generally used that it would be very confusing if the name was changed, and under these circumstances the name Red Rock Cod will have to remain.
