Notes: Jim Cameron writes: Collins gives this and <i>spit chips</i> (with same meaning) as <i>Austral</i>, with a cryptic reference <i>"also NZ"</i>. NZSOD gives <i>spit chips</i> as <i>Aust.</i>. Neither word is in DNZE or NZ Slang. My impression is that <i>spit tacks</i> is the more usual expression in NZ and it is the variant I use mself. See <i>Wairarapa Times-Age</i> 3/9/1999.
