Quote: Having depleted our daily scroggin allowance that day and taken five hours, not the rcommended four, the next, longest leg to Portage seems ominous: an eight or nine-hour tramp of more than 20km. ... We coax the boys regularly - a barley sugar at half past each hour, a scroggin stop on the hour.

Quote: If any word originating in the mountain clubs deserves to be incorporated in the language it is perhaps scroggin. That mixture of raisins, sultanas, chocolate, nuts, boiled lollies, a mixture of bits and pieces of whatever one fancies, was evolved to fill the need for a sustaining, palatable, easily-carried food, one as readily available for a bite snatched in a cold, wet, momentary halt as for a welcome spell in the warmth and sun. The word seems to come from Otago but its derivation is not clear. There is a Scotch and North of England dialect word scrog which refers to stunted bushes, and if some Otago Scot had this in mind it prompts dark thoughts as to what the original comestible may have been like. Perhaps it is one of those words that have no known ancestry, that come out of the blue, such as children sometimes so happily coin.
