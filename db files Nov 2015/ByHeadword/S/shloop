Quote: (Speaking of Sir James Hector)  He must have had a very strong stomach for he mentioned once how they had cooked wekas . . . . I had found them quite palatable if you could get rid of the rich strong grease.  He said they put a stone inside the body which caused the melted grease to accumulate there.  'Then', I said, 'you could throw it away'.  'Oh; no,  oh, no' and cupping his hands to his mouth he showed how you could hold the bird's body upside down and then: shloop! . . . .'
