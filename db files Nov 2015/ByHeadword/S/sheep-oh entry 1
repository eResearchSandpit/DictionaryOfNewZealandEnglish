Quote: The `sheep-oh' (penner-up) also held an important position. In addition to filling up the catching pens, he weighed the bales and recorded them, with their descriptions in the wool book. <i>Ibid.</i> 127 At Waimate there were about 50 men and boys employed for the shearing - 22 shearers, 1 sheep-oh, 4 fleece-pickers, 4 wool-rollers, 1 brander, 1 wool-classer, 1 classer's boy, 3 pressers, 1 waggoner, 1 cook, 1 cook's mate, generally known as the offsider or `slushy' 8 shepherds; and last, but not least the shed boss, ... [fn] In the early days the manager acted as shed boss. Later, when the agricultural work  increased, a special shed boss was engaged. <i>Ibid.</i> 130  The shearers were, of course, the autocrats of the shed, but the `sheep-oh' (penner-up) also held an important position. In addition to filling up the catching pens, he weighed the bales and recorded them, with their descriptions, in the wool book.
