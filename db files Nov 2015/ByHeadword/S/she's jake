Quote: <i>she's jake</i> yet another reassuring phrase, indicating something is in good working order; less commonly <i>she's jakerloo/jake-a-bon/tray jake</i>; indicates French origins of `Jacques' for `jack', or cod or mock French extensions of `jack', with `bon', good, `tray' for `tre's', very; Partridge says from `jannock', honest or equitable. All NZA.
