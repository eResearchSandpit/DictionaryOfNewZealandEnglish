Quote:  In June, 1925, the council had erected what was known as a `silent policeman' at the intersection of Dee and Esk Streets. On August 13, 1936, the council decided it should be replaced by a dome and centre line. The inspector said the `silent policeman' had been the means of training motorists to keep to the left of the centre line.
