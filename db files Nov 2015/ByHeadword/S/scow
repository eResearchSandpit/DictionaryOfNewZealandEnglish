Quote: As far as orthodox shipbuilding goes, a scow wasn't a vessel; a scow was a flat-bottomed monstrosity - flat on the bottom and flat on the deck, with a V-bow on it and a long run aft, then rigged like a schooner or a ketch. The first scows that were built had lee-boards to hold them on the wind, like a Dutch barge - that's where the idea came from. ... The first one was built up at Leigh in 1873 ... by a shipbuilder there called Maikeljohn.
