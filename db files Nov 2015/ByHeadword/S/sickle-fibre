Infant sickle-fibres are much less abundant than baby ones. Most sickle-fibres with coarse medulla in the post-natal region sustain this up to some eight weeks after birth. For these it is convenient to use the term "chalky sickle-fibres," from their dull white appearance. Super-sickle-fibres, some with a good deal of medulla in the neck, occasionally remain fine after birth ...
