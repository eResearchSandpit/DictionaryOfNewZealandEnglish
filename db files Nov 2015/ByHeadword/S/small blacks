Quote: Rippa Rugby has been so well received by primary school children that provincial unions are being urged to replace the Small Blacks model in the first years of club rugby... Small Blacks rugby has been played in under-6 to under-8 grades for some years with two-handed touch, lineouts, scrums and kickoffs.
