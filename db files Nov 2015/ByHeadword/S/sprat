Quote: There appear to be three species of fish belonging to the family Clupeidae in New Zealand waters, viz., <i>Engraulis antipodum </i>, or anchovy; <i>Sardinia neopilchardus </i>, or pilchard, and <i>Harengula antipoda </i>, or sprat. <i>Ibid.</i> 316 The sprat is the smaller of the two, but in the numerous notices of these fish, the name `sprat' probably includes in many cases immature pilchards. <i>Ibid.</i> 319 In the case of fish-stomachs examined at the station, sprats have been found in red cod, blue cod, southern king-fish, barracouta, and spined dog-fish; and pilchards in barracouta.
