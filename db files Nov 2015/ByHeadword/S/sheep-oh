Quote: On the morrow the merry faces of the Maori shearers would vanish from the shed, the rotund forms of the skirters would have gone, and the supple figures of the "fleece-ohs" would no longer flit up and down the boards; the clip of the shears, the clang of the pen doors, the sharp cry of 'sheep-oh,' the baa of a shorn wether to his unshorn mate no longer would be heard.

Quote: The boss Maori undertakes to supply all the rouseabouts (as shed hands are termed) i.e., fleece pickers, wool rollers and `Sheep oh!' the [sic] owner or manager generally gets his own pressers and expert (where machines are run). <i>Ibid.</i> 17 Another job suitable for a new hand is `Sheep O!' The work consists of filling up the `catching pens' when empty. The shearer who takes the last sheep (called the `cobbler') calls out `Sheep O!' when the boy ... immediately fills up the back pen.

Quote: The title of this book is the call of the shearer when his catching pen is empty, and it is inseparable from the shearing and crutching of sheep. <i>Ibid.</i> 27 Standing among the sheep were two men whose duty it was to fill the pens, the sheep-os Bill Ritchie and Link Campbell; there would be no insistent call of `Sheep-O!' this day.
