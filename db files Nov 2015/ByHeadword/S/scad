Quote: MACKEREL (<i>Scomber Australasicus</i>). ... This valuable fish is well known as an occasional visitant in Wellington Harbour, being called by the Natives tawatawa. In colour, size, and form it closely approaches the common mackerel of England, and is very superior in delicacy to the scad or horse-mackerel, which is commonly called the mackerel in New Zealand. <i>Ibid.</i> 100 There is an allied species [to the trevalli] called the koheru, or the herring scad, which is without doubt edible. ... Being a species of  the <i>Caranx</i> genus (<i>Caranx koheru</i>), it is here noticed.
