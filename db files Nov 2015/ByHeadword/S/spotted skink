Quote: Recently published genetic data suggests that the spotted skink (as here defined) involves three distinct species ...

Quote: Almost half of New Zealand's reptiles are threatened or endangered. It is now illegal to handle or keep in captivity any native lizard without a permit from the Department of Conservation. Some, such as the spotted skink (<i>Oligosoma lineoocellatum</i>), are still widespread, although their numbers are probably dwindling.

The species is also foundon islands in Wellington Harbour .. on islands in the MarlboroughSounds and is widespread in the eastern South Island ... In the North Island, spotted skinks coexist with brown, speckled and common skinks.

Quote: <b>Spotted skink</b>: Oligosoma lineoocellatum, 111mm in length from snout to vent (minus tail).  It is much bigger than the common skink which is 73mm.  The king of the lizards in Ponatahi Lizard Sanctuary on Tim Hewitt's farm, he says he first saw them in the 1960s in their hundreds, but now they're rare.
