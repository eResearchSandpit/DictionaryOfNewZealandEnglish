Quote: The boss a bit anxious to keep the sheep up to the men, the showers had been frequent, but the carrying capacity of the shed, which held up to 3,000 sheep, supplemented by a good shandy-gaffing of the wet with the dry kept them going .. at this particular time, the shandy-gaffing had been carried out under fairly heavy bursts of rain.
