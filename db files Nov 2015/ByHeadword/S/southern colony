Quote: Though by no means faultless, the measure [1846 Constitution Act] seems calculated to be a fair opening to the true history of our great Southern Colony, after the preliminary chapters of tragi-comic blundering. It sweeps away the whole system of official machinery and self-impeding sophistry established by Lord Stanley - all the `Treaty of Waitangi' nonsense, and all the past Downing-Street plans for hindering the settlement of the islands.' Henceforward, echoed the <i>Colonial Gazette</i>, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'.
