Quote: Consider ... the use of the borderline action terms Sleets (Caversham) and Do's (Nth. East Valley) ... meant to overcome a difficulty which sometimes arises in the marble game of Holey. The first player to reach the hole may discover that although he is now entitled to fire at his opponent, the opponent's marble is too far away for him to hit it. He may then attempt to force the opponent to bring his marble nearer to the hole by the use of the action-term `Sleets'.
