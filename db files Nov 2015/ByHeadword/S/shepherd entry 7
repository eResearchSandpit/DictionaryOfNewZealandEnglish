Quote: The prowling, dastardly enemy ... plants himself at the claim, and there ... he patiently waits during the absence of his future victim. This, in the language of the diggers, is called `shepherding a claim'. At the end of twenty-four hours he seizes it, and ... appropriates ... the hard-earned property of the sick man.
