Quote: A heavy iron bracket with an arm that projected from the side of the fireplace was called a swey (or sweigh). An arrangement of hook allowed it to support cooking vessels at various levels, including the iron girdle on which scones and oatcakes were baked.
Notes: NB: On the facing page, p. 86, there is an illustration of a swey which is captioned "SWAE". Even in Drummond, the spelling is a movable feast.
