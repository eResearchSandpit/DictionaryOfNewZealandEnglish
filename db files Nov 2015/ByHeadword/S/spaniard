Quote: Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: [Fantastic names of plants] show the imagination running riot; they seem appropriate, though often it is impossible to give any definite reason for the name. ... `Spaniard' [like `Wild-Irishman' is] another name of unexplained origin. There seems even less connection between the human Spaniard and the vegetable spaniard than between the human wild Irishman and the vegetable wild-irishman; and the conjectured corruption `spine-yard', whilst improbable, is no more improbable than the fabled `Bill's-yard' as the origin of `billiard'

Quote: <i>Spaniard, speargrass</i>.- Various species of <i>Aciphylla</i>. Plants with stiff sharp leaves like rapiers growing out thickly in all directions from the ground. They were thickest in the hills, but there were plenty on the plains before they were ploughed. Horses avoid them carefully, which makes riding through them unpleasant. There are stories of men falling off and landing on one. Shepherds use the flower stalks for torches when burning. In the 'eighties and 'nineties at Mount Peel they used to all the broader leaved sort Spaniards and the narrower <i>Speargrass</i>; but most people use both names indiscriminately. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) `There is one beast of a plant they call speargrass, or Spaniard.' (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 48).
