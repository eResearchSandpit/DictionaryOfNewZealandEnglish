Notes: Same or other forms of the word were perhaps used much earlier than the 1890's in Austr and NZ (see <i>shickery</i>), and though Hebrew (? Yiddish) <i>Shikkur</i> is undoubtedly the source of the term (and cf variant spellings) there was probably some associative reinforcement from Eng. or Sc dialect shig, <i>shiggry</i> (see<i> shickery</i>). In September 1977 the word in its various forms was not known by a second-year tutorial at Victoria University of Wellington; nor by an immigrant from England of 12 years standing

Quote:  Yiddish became a main source of <i>Rotwelsch</i> [the cant language of thieves, etc.] In the course of time a number of originally cant words of Hebrew provenance passed into general use in German, though tending to remain at a more or less substandard level. Modern examples are colloquialisms like <i>acheln</i> eat, <i>Chuzpe</i> f. insolence, ... <i>mies</i> ugly, <i>Moos</i> n. money, <i>schicker </i>drunk, <i>schofel </i>trashy. These examples also occur in Standard Yiddish: <i>akhlen </i>(slang), <i>khutspe, ... mies, moes </i>(slang), <i>shiker, shofl. </i>
