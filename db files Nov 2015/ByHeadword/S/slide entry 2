Quote: What happens? Pop-In is very informal. Those who attend are free to come and go as they choose. Sessions begin at 9:30am. Tea, coffee and cordial are available from the kitchen slide from 10am onwards, At about 11am the children are offered a piece of apple and a story is shared. This is followed by music time with musical instruments, action songs and games.
