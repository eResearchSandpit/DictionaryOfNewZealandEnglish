Quote: <i>Scrub, n</i>. country overgrown with thick bushes. Henry Kingsley's explanation (1859), that the word means shrubbery, is singularly misleading, the English word conveying an idea of smallness and order compared with the size and confusion of the Australian use. Yet he is etymologically correct, for <i>Scrobb</i> is Old English (Anglo-Saxon) for shrub; but the use had disappeared in England.

Quote: <i>Scrub, n.</i> Thicket of shrubs or bushes of too low a growth to be called <i>bush</i> (q.v.). On the plains it usually grew in belts or patches. The best known components in Canterbury are Manuka, Wild Irishman, Miki-miki (of which the shepherds make walking sticks), and Moutain pine (Totara nivalis). A single plant of scrub is called a <i>bush</i>, while of course a single specimen in <i>the bush</i> is a tree. Perhaps (if the question couldn't be settled by species) ten feet would be the dividing height between <i>s</i>. and <i>b</i>.
