Quote: Roscoe Tait's first mission as a volunteer for search and rescue was in June 1970 when Jeanette and Harvey Crewe were reported missing from their Pukekawa farm. "I was a member of the caving club and the police got us to look through caves and cliffs at Port Waikato for bodies or evidence." Nearly 30 years later Tait is a senior adviser to New Zealand Land Search and Recsue Inc., one of 193 voluntary advisers whom the police will immediately contact when someone is reported missing in the bush, on a mountain or elsewhere in the great outdoors...  Two-day workshops are now regularly held, attended by volunteers and police, so the levels of search and rescue are standardised around the country.
