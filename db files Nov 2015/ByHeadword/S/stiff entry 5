Quote: `What's he like?' `A stiff,' a listening member interjected. `Anyone who would vote for you must be a stiff.' <i>Ibid.</i> 90  `I'll bet you two to one Mr. Brown's a stiff.' ... `No man signing himself `A. Brown' can be a stiff unless he's grubby or boozed. If he were a stiff it would be `Arthur M. Brown' or `A. Morris Brown or A.M. Brown, Esq.,' Jordan joked. <i>Ibid.</i>  94 You are a chronic stiff, a bum, a deadbeat, a soak, an optimist.
