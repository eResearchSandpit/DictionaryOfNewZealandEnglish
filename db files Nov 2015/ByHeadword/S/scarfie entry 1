Notes: Gobey writes "[This meaning] for which I have no documentary evidence, was common locally when my two sons attended the Wadestown Primary School in the early 1980s. There are several religious sects (Christian and others) which require women/girls over a certain age to cover their head. There was, and still is, a chapel of the Exlusive Brethren based in Crofton Downs. The other kids knew them as the Scarfies.
