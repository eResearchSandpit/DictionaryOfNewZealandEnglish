Quote: In a letter dated 8th March 1850, in mentioning a visit to the Taieri Plain, the writer says: "We visited the warri or hut of a Shaproon - <i>ie.,</i> one of the retired whalers 'who have married Maori wives.' Can you tell me the meaning and derivation of the word Shaproon, and why the retired whalers were so called?" <i>Ibid</i> 22 September. 24   Shaproon is from the French <i>chaperon</i>, and originally meant "little captain." ..There is no doubt that the term was used by French sailors and those in contact with them with the same meaning as English sailors use the word mate. Mispronounced and misspelt by its adoption into the English of rough-and-ready sea-faring men, shaproon would have this signification, and even under certain circumstances might reassume its original acceptation of little leader, and be addressed to the captain of a small band, and become equivalent in a new country, as this was 50 years ago, to the word pioneer.

The Pilgrims looked with contemptuous eye on this people of strange aspect and impure blood, and did despise them. ...

Quote: Who first called these immigrants by this opprobrious name is not stated, but it seems to me most probable that the Pilgrims used it as a term of contempt, and [110] that the immigrants took it to themselves much as the `Old Contemptibles' ... adopted their enemies' names in a spirit of defiance. ... There arises the further question as to the origin of the word which ... has been explained as an Irish `shaughraun'. Now why should an Irish word have been used at that time by the English settlers in Canterbury? ... My belief is that the word was not originally `Shagroon' but `Shabroon', `shabberoon', `shabbaroon' (all spellings occur) which is on record from the 18th century onwards, meaning `a mean, shabby fellow', `a disreputable or mean-spirited fellow', and this, which would be probably familiar to the English Pilgrims, is just the sort of term which would naturally be used to describe their rivals. This `shabroon' derives from the slang `shab', a low fellow, recorded as early as 1637, and no doubt closely alied to the standard `shabby', and ultimately from `shab' and `scab', two forms of the old English word. ... I conjecture that the `shabroon' [?does Wall mean `shagroon] of the English Pilgrims was by some pronounced with the `b' and by others with the `g', nobody ever having seen the word written or printed. [EDD records only `shaggareen' from east Yorkshire `an untidy, slovenly person'; possibly f. shabrag]

Notes: [1851] 1866 Canterbury Rhymes 5, 9, 125 `Pilgrims and Prophets'. [title of Poem] 9.[NOTE 1866] 125. During the first year of the Settlement, Canterbury was invaded by a body of sheep-farmers from Port Philip (Victoria) who were regarded by the settlers partly with admiration as successful Colonists, and partly with horror as disbelievers in the art of colonisation and the `Canterbury System'. The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the vistiors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders.
