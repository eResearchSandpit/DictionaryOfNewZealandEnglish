Quote: From Portland Island a fish called `soldier-fish' is recorded, fourteen specimens having been taken in the months of May, June , August, and October. They weighed from 1lb. to 1 1/2 lb. each, and their stomachs contained fish or shellfish. No ova were found in any of them. I do not know what species is referred to under this name. [fn]*In Diefenbach's `New Zealand,' vol. ii., p.218, a fish is mentioned under the name <i>julis miles (Labrus coccineus </i>, J. R. Forster, apud Schn.;<i> Labrus miles </i>, Bl. Schn., p264) `named the `soldier' by the seamen who accompanied Cook on his second voyage.' Perhaps this is the fish referred to.

Quote: SCARLET PARROT-FISH (PUWAI-WHAKARUA or PAU) <i>Pseudolabrus (Lunolabrus) miles </i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... [Otago commercial line fishermen] also said that never at any time had they known the `Soldier Fish,' as they call it, to be abundant and often went for months without hooking one at The Rock. Then for some unknown reason several would be caught in one day.

Quote: The Soldier-fish (<i>Scorpaena cruenta </i>) and the variegated horror with the droll name of Hapuka's Grandfather (<i>Helicolenus percoides </i>) are members of the same order, as also are the Pig-fish (<i>Congiopodus leucopoecilus </i>) and the Toad-fish (<i>Neophrynichthys latus </i>) whose names appropriately suggest something out of the run of ordinary fish shapes.

Quote: SEAPERCH (POHUIAKAROA) JOCK STUART, HIGHLANDER, FIVEFINGER, SOLDIERFISH or SCRODDIE <i> Helicolenus papillosus </i> (Bloch and Schneider) The seaperch is a fish well known to all fishermen both sports and commercial fishermen alike, who give it quite a number of vernacular names, a few of which are as follows: Jock Stuart, Highlander, Fivefinger and soldierfish. These names have a bearing on some distinguishing characteristic of the fish. ... The name Soldierfish is derived from the similarities of this fish to the activities of a soldier or picket on sentinel duty. I have often seen Seaperch stand or, rather, rest at attention on its pectoral fins for lengthy periods. When it did move, it moved to the right or to the left with the precision of a well-trained soldier.

Quote: In vain did the sole kick; the schnapper snapped to no purpose; the trunk of the elephant fish thrashed the prison bars, and they broke not; the soldierfish made a bayonet charge against the thin brown lines, but they did not give way; the squid spilled more ink than Wellington's most prolific newspaper correspondent, but it made no impression on the meshes.
