Quote: Mr. Kench spoke of Gladstone in terms of superlative praise, as though this old, and now happily dead and at rest, time-serving, word-spinning, hair-splitting and principle-pawning politician never coughed or sneezed, or did anything else wanton, wayward or windy that required the use of a snout-clout, or could have caused his contemporaries to stare, start or sniff.
