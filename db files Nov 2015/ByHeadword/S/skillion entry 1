Quote: The wool-shed .... has a large central space, and an aisle-like partition on each side. These last will be for holding the sheep at night. ... In a wool-shed, the aisles would be called skilions (whence the name is derived, I know not, nor whether it has two `l's' in it or one).

Quote: <i>Skillion</i>.- [Variant of 'skillin' and skilling', recorded from the fourteenth century, all late examples being provincial English; origin unknown. --A.W.] In old Australian and New Zealand books (up to about 1880) it is common and means the sheep-holding part of a woolshed. I can remenber an old hand mentioning the word in the 'nineties. I have tried it on several elderly shepherds since the war I and none of them understood it. I imagined the word had gone completely out of use until last month (May 1933), when I bought five tons of chaff from a man and asked him to store it for a few weeks. He looked into his woolshed and said, `Oh yes, there's plenty of room in the skillions.' I felt as if I had met a notornis. ' . . called skillions (whence the name is derived I know not, nor whether it has two l's in it or one). All the sheep go into the skilions.' (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 139). `A constant succession of woolly sheep being brought up to fill the skillions.' ([1874 Lady Barker Station Life], p. 34).
