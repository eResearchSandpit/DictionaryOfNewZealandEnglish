Pronunciation:
Notes: (The NZ sense of <i>sprag </i> n and v would seem to derived from a dialect variant of <i>sprig </i>: cf. EDD sb4, and vb 8. and OED <i> sprig </i> sb 2. The NZ sense possibly also associated with SNAG, SNIG, STAG (q.v.), and <i>stake </i>, of similar meaning. EDD <i>sprag </i> sb2 citation looks suspiciously close to the NZ sense, though the Yks sense given suggests otherwise.) ca1900 at least Havelock (W.H.B. Orsman)
