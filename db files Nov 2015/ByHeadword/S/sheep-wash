Quote: <i>Sheep wash</i>.- Place and plant for washing sheep before shearing was a fairly common practice. If the sheep were <i>hot water washed </i>their owner had to built an expensive apparatus. The remains of these <i>s.w.s</i> were not uncommon 20 years ago. I do not know the technical terms for this process, except that the most important place was <i>at the spout</i>. Everybody used to get very wet.
