Quote: The chief executives of the core public sector departments are Mr Wintringham's legacy - he appointed 30 of the 35 incumbents. He also recommended candidates to the positions of Police Commissioner and head of the Defence Force - the first time a State Services Commssioner has been involved in those jobs and a sign of the Government's faith in him.
