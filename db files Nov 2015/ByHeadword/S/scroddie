Quote:  SEAPERCH (POHUIAKAROA) JOCK STUART, HIGHLANDER, FIVEFINGER, SOLDIERFISH or SCRODDIE<i> Helicolenus papillosus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) The seaperch is a fish well known to all fishermen both sports and commercial fishermen alike... The name Scroddie, commonly used at the northern end of the South Island, is derived from the word Scrod which means a young Dogfish. It appears from my researches that when the early colonists first saw a small Seaperch they at once named it Scrod and later the `ie' was tacked on to make Scroddie.
