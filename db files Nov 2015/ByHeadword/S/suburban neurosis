Quote: Remember suburban neurosis? Women - who, like Maori, were once seen as "abnormal" in themselves - were suffering from suburban neurosis in droves in the '60s, and valiumed to the hilt by fashionable psychiatrists, until feminism put their situation in a different light. Suddenly - overnight - there was no more suburban neurosis.
