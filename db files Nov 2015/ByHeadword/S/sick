Quote: The mercury plates were seldom perfect: the finest gold was lost by flotation while with cemented gold a thin coating of iron oxide (`rusty gold') often prevented amalgamation. The mercury itself became `sick' or `floured'; both sodium and nitric acid were employed to improve its amalgamating qualities. <i>Ibid.</i> 527 FLOURED MERCURY: mercury that has lost its amalgamating properties because of impurities in the ore or the wash. The mercury is then `sick'.
