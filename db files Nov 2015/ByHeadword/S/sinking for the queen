Quote: DUFFER: applied to a rush, a shaft, or a claim generally. A failure. Synonyms were `shicer', `stringer' or, in the case of a false rush, `store-keepers' rush'. A claim which was exhausted was said to be `duffered out'. At Ross in 1866 putting down a duffer shaft was termed `sinking for the Queen'. Duffers (Creek) is a common West Coast place-name.
