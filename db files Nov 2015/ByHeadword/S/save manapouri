Quote: MANAPOURI stickers seem to come in a number of different forms. There is the common "Save Manapouri," a simple plea from the heart. "Help Save Manapouri," a call not to be just sympathetic but do something about it. Then there is "I Want to Save Manapouri," a pitiful cry by someone who feels impotent to do anything. But my favourite is the cynic's sticker indicating that he is tired of the whole business: "Drain Manapouri."

Quote: The turning point of the opposition to the raising of the lake came when a crowded and lively public meeting was held in Invercargill  on 30 October [1969]. As a result of that meeting, the first "Save Manapouri" committee was set up. Similar groups were quickly established in other centres around the country.
