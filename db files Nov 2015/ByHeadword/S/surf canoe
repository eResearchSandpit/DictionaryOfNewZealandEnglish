Quote: Duke Gillies, 78, evolved the surf canoe from an early design in 1932 to the craft which became the standard New Zealand surf canoe in the 1940s. Paddling surf canoes is an art and Gillies remembers a conversation with a young surf lifesaver: "I said I coudn't remember the last time I tipped out and he said he couldn't remember the last time he got in dry."
