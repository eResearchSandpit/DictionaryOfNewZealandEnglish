Quote: Mr Whatuira had been out of the gang life for eight years at the time, but put his spine back on in October, when Black Power Manawatu came into being. [The club refers to the patch on the jacket as a spine: "The spine is what holds the back together"]... He is attired in a blue bandanna, a Black Power t-shirt and a leather jacket that bears the spine... "They see our spine before they see our hearts. They see the patch before they see what's inside."
