Quote: Another discovery was that the word `Scotch' was worked much harder in New Zealand than in Scotland. It might be used with degrees of meaning ranging from praiseworthy frugality to out-and-out niggardliness. It [41] might be: ``A' will make a farm out of that place if anyone can - he's pretty Scotch.' Or it might be `B's' too Scotch to feed his kids properly.' Fortunately I had mastered the new usages when some months later a man gave me his views on parsimony as a Scottish characteristic. `They talk about the Scotch,' he said. `I reckon that a really scotch Englishman is as scotch or maybe scotcher than any Scotchman.'
