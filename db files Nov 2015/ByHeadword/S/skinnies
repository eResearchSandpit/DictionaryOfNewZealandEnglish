Quote:  In that conversation Bellini offered the accused, what the accused called `skinnies.' The Crown alleged `skinnies' meant LSD but they produced no documentation to prove that was what was meant, Mr McLinden said. The accused will say `skinnies' referred to photographs of ladies of the same kind referred to by the skinflicks movies.
