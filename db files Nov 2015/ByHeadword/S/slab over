Quote: A small footbridge lately crossed the Ho Ho Creek, close to the Blue Spur township.  It has been used by packers and horsemen as well as foot passengers, and was constructed on primaeval principals, two or more longitudinal sleepers being laid across, and these roughly slabbed over, with a couple of braces on each side.
