Quote: 'A good deal was said in Court on Tuesday during the hearing of a case about threshing-machines, and no little amusement was caused by a list given by one witness of the 'technical' names of titles of some of the workmen employed about them.  'Chaffy' and 'baggy' raised a smile merely, but 'straw walloper' tickled everybody except the witness, who glanced around with an air of pity on the laughing faces of those who were ignorant of the designation of the man who attends to the straw elevator.  Some machines, it appears, boast of two 'straw wallopers', others are content with one'.

Quote: The "straw walloper" who goes with a mill takes no interest in stacking the straw. His duty is simply to keep the mouth of the elevator clear.
