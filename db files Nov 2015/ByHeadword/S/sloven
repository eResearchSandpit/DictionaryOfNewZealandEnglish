Quote: I am interested in your letter because I had never come across the term before so had to get busy and `find' it. The definition I have run to earth reads: <i>Sloven</i>: The torn splintered portion of timber left on a stump or the end of a butt where the `key' finally broke when the tree fell. Syn. spaul, stub-chuck (American) ? also `Barbers'chair', the splintered stump of a newly felled tree. I hope this gives you the information you want. This is a new word to me and I am glad to have encountered it.

Quote: ... the severed end of the tree faced us; and its concentric rings, marred by the jagged area of broken timber (the sloven as my uncle afterwards named it), made it look like a sort of improvised target for distant shooting.
