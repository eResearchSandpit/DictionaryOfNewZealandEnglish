Quote: To <i>sidle </i>, to go around the side or across the face of a hill, is a characteristic New Zealand expression, strange to the Englishman or Australian. The example of 1821 in O.E.D.: `Ye know the footpath sidles down the hill', suggests that something of the New Zealand meaning was not unknown in England, but it cannot have been well known, or mountaineers would not have started to use <i>traverse </i>, both as a noun and as a verb, towards the end of last century. <i>Sidle </i> is well known among high-country musterers. As it is a word most likely to be used in open hilly or mountainous country, one may guess that musterers and up-country people gave it currency, whence it was adopted by mountain club people. If ski-ing had not brought its more or less international vocabulary with it we should no doubt be sidling slopes, on skis, that we now traverse... From 1936 to 1938 in <i>The Tramper </i> there are a number of references to `sidling tracks' and `sidling routes'. Towards the end of 1938 comes `after sidling round the head of the said stream', and, a year later, `we sidle the top of Three Johns', and from then on the verb flourishes. In 1940 comes `on a long sidle', and from then on the noun is as common as the verb. <i>Ibid.</i> 41 From the top basin we sidled up tiresome scree, ... and at last emerged on the top of the divide.

Quote: Often, with back bent low, he must thread [sic] the dirty overgrown bed of a steep little watercourse, or, still with back bent, sidle along the muddy slope of a steep hill, through a tunnel in the koromiko copse; or, straightening his back with a sigh of relief as he emerges on the open shingle-bed, find that he has to ford and ford again and again the cold rapid stream, slipping ahd splashing over weed-covered stones.

Quote: A few blows with the tomahawk, a fire-stick judiciously employed, and, should the brook be high, a little sidling over a low bank or two, is the most that can be needed, though the gorge being very narrow, its aspect may at first appear discouraging for a mile or two.

Quote: We sidled along the spurs, slipping and stumbling over the steep, wet, frozen, stony ground, for three of four miles, which seemed interminable, there the river Mataura approaches the hills, and made our course more westerly; a little further on we crossed the Otamita, a mountain stream, that came rushing out from between the hills, with a clear stony bottom.

In common use among trampers. The term was not understood by Dr. I.V. Newman, lecturer in Botany, V.U.C., an Australian.'

Quote: Most of the Clarence block is `sidled'. That is to say, the spurs are so big that it is necessary to have several men sidling on the `face' or side of each spur. I have seen as many as ten men on a face sidling along about half a mile apart. The man on the top beat, in all but exceptional circumstances, keeps a little in front, and each man down the face is a little behind the man above.
