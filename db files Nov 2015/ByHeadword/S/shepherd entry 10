Quote: <i>Shepherd.</i>- (1) Man employed to work sheep. Except a <i>lambing s.</i>, or <i>shed s</i>., who are specially employed for a certain time, a <i>s</i>. is a permanent hand. If he is only employed for the busy season he is called a <i>musterer.</i> (C.) (2) To tail sheep by day and yard them at night. The <i>shepherding </i>system of sheep management was much employed in the early days of Australia, where the sheep would otherwise have been exposed to attack from blacks and dingoes. The <i>shagroons </i>(q.v.) carried it on to some extent on the Canterbury plains in the 'fifties, but soon gave it up for a system of <i>boundary keeping,</i> and afterwards fenced their runs. (C.) 3. To be a shepherd, e.g. `Bill is <i>shepherding</i> at __'s.'
