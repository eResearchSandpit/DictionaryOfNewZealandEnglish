Quote: The cottages in Stewart's Island are all well garnished with a luxury of the southward - the mutton bird. This I take to be the bird which is sometimes called the sheerwater, or the sooty petrel - a black bird about the size of a duck, with long wings, which all of us have seen on our voyage out skimming over the waves. In the month of December these birds resort to the rocky islands about Foveaux's Straits in great numbers, for the purpose of breeding.
