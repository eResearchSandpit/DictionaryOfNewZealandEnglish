Quote: Although inadvertently administered, Angus had been under the influence of `sool,' which gave him an unfair advantage over an enemy who was, for the moment, peaceably inclined. Bill had been the victim of an illegal attack. The New Zealand Standards Institute doesn't mention the word `sool' in its code of by-laws. Perhaps it is too simple. Officialdom does things the hard way. `It is to be forbidden,' says the Institute, `in any public place, to set on, urge, encourage, aid or assist any dog to rush at, attack or worry any person or animal.' This would seem to include baiting, egging, sooling and/or sic-ing, though not specifically mentioned.

Quote: A SCOLDING WOMAN.- The barbarities of the ducking stool for the cure of scolding women, though abolished by law, are now sometimes practiced [sic] by a kind of social barbarity none the less reprehensible. Women scold only when they are ill. Instead of blaming them we should prescribe American Co.'s Hop Bitters. The entire system will undergo a genial pleasant change. The nerves will be quieted, and acerbity of word and thought will give place to amiability and affection. Healthy women do not scold ...
Notes: nb wrongly placed, word at the end is blurred on original but is scold, not sool.  Advert
