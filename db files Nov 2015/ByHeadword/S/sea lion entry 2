Quote: This group, the sea-lions, rendered so familiar by the rookery outside the Golden Gate of San Francisco, is represented in the south by <i>Zalophus lobatus</i>, which is found chiefly in the longitude of the Cape of Good Hope, and by <i>Protoarctus hookeri</i>, which is supposed to be a different species frequenting the islands in the longitude of New Zealand and southward, and is best known at the present time as the Auckland Islands sea-lion.
