Quote: Miss Amazon's instructions to her jockey were to `shepherd' the horse around the course. (ie. ride a waiting race .... The philologist would note that the word `shepherding' is of universal application in colonial parlance. If a stranger is lionised about a place, he is said to be `shepherded'. I once heard a man ask his neighbour to `shepherd' his grog while he left the room. It is of course natural that metaphors should be derived from the chief industries of the country.]
