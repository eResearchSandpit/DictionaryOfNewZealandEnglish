Quote: ...for this reporter the sorry affair of Sergeant Dan sums it up. The merry Dan, in his lemon-squeezer hat and his chipper uniform, stood to attention over Flemings mill in Gore for almost a century. Dan was a national icon, every bit as much Kiwiana as Buzzy Bee and the <i>Edmond's Cookbook.</i>

Quote: Boyhood train trips to and fro Invercargill were characterized by my careful selection of a seat by a window on the eastern side of the carriage to ensure that I wouldn't miss seeing Sergeant Dan on the Creamota mill in Gore.  My brother and I both had Sergeant Dan porridge plates but neither owned a matching spoon, as far as I recall.

Quote: I was a <i>Spot On</i> child. I didn't actually belong to the official Spot On Club - I'd already pledged myself to Captain Dan's Cremoata Club.
Notes: Note two mistakes - Captain instead of Sergeant and Cremoata instead of Creamoata.
