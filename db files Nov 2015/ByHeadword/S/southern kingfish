Quote: <i>Gemfish Rexea solandri </i>... Also occurs off southern Australia, as well as Japan. New Zealand names include silver or southern kingfish and hake (which is now easily confused with the true hake). The name gemfish, conveying family relationship as well as irridescence, is more appropriate.
