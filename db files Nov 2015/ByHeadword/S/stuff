Quote: Under the heading of 'Stuffing the Ballot' the Canterbury Times shows how the above can be done. The Canterbury Commissioner furnishes even more striking illustrations of the method in which the ballot is 'stuffed' by eager applicants. 'Out of three hundred and three applicants at our last ballot,' Mr Humphries says, 'there were no fewer than forty-two single women, besides a great number of married women, and there was not one of either condition that did not bear the same name as some one of the male applicants.' Mr John Hay, the Southland Commissioner says that he can see no way by which the system provided by the Act of 1892 could be improved upon, but he strongly urges that only one mode of ballot for all tenures and all classes of land should be adopted, and that this should prevent more than one member of a family applying for the same section.
