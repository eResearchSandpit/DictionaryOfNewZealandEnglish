Quote: I can still remember calculating at theend of five years that I had partaken of600 "sinkers" during my stay, although Iate less and less of them as the yearswore on and ended up running a "sinker-eating competition" at my table over aperiod of several weeks. Every "sinker"night each of the Fourth Formers under mycharge was given the opportunity ofseeing how much of it their systems couldabsorb before the others got what wasleft.
