Quote: If Thomas had a slug to ride the day before, he had a star-gazer of the worst sort this morning. One gallop on it made him feel that a bad fall was inevitable, so he declined, albeit reluctantly and shamefacedly, to go out that day on horseback.

Quote: Most gurnards are brownish-red but larger specimens are often bright red on top and white below. The Stargazer is sometimes known as the Mud Gurnad, River Gurnard or Mud-Grubber Gurnard but is in fact no relation. Similarly the Sea Perch is sometimes called a Rock Gurnard - ...<i>Ibid.</i> 208 STARGAZER A distinctive estaurine fish which spends most of its life buried in mud up to the eyes. ... Comes in two varieties - the Common Stargazer and his tubbier cousin the Spotted Stargazer. ... Other names are River Gurnard, Mud Gurnard, Flathead Gurnard and Mud Grubber.
