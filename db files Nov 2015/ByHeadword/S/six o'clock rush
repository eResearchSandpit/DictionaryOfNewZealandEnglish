Quote: New Zealand has developed many phrases that depend on local interpretation: e.g. `The Limited', `the six oclock rush', `off the bitumen', `motor camp', `to farewell', `to pencil in', `to check up on', `return (at meals)'. All these are immediately understandable to New Zealanders, but not always to others.
