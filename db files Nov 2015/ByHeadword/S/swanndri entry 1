Quote: The first Swanndri was made by William Broome at Milton in 1871 and the design of the distinctive bush shirt has changed little. It did get a minor makeover in 1927 when the hood, laced front and long sleeves were added but apart from that the garment has remained largely unchanged for more than 130 years.
