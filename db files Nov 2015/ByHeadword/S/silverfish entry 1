Quote: There are only three fish in the River Avon, sufficiently common to justify the supposition that either of them may be the adult form of the Whitebait; these are the Bull-head, the Silver-fish, and the Smelt. The name of Smelt is applied indiscriminately to the two latter fish, we will ... retain the trivial name of Silver-fish as a distinction. We may first dismiss the Bull-head ...
