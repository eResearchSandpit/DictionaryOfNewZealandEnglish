Quote:  Percy Gray was spinner, and Alf Burke, the boxer - you know, the man who takes the bets ... Well, everything was going well till [?] spun two coins very high - trying to `float' them - that means land them without spinning them more than twice ... Someone else picked up [the penny], looked at it, and shouted `Boys, it's a grey - two tails on it!'
