Quote: Turning a little along the ridge to the left, we descended a steep shingle slip of some 300 or 400 feet, and following down a gully with loose stones, alpine plants, and finally black birch, found ourselves, by about four, p.m., on the S.E side of the range, and to our joy, once more upon the banks of the East Wairau, which here pierces right through the mountains, and leads directly to our camp of the morning.
