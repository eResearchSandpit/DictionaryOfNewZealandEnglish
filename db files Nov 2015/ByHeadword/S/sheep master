Quote: Having lost several sheep this winter from what I believe to be red-water, and having also been told of loss sustained by some of my neighbours from the same cause, after having treated the patients in the way that neat cattle would be treated; may I ask you, in the interest of our Auckland sheep masters, to publish the following description of the disease in sheep, by W.C.  Spooner, V.S., Southhampton?

Quote: When I first read this inscription [in the Memorial Church, Cave], the word `sheep-men' made me involuntarily flinch. Years later, when I had forgotten it, I suddenly met it again, and again I recoiled. So aghast was I that I spent weeks collecting every old term for `runholders' I could, and I found thirteen, viz., `flock owners,' `flock masters,' `pastoralists,' `run holders,' `run owners,' `sheep owners,' `sheep holders,' `sheep masters,' `squatters,' `station holders,' `station owners,' `stock holders,[sic] and `stock owners.' The word `sheepmen' is a modern Americanism, and using this anachronism mars a splendid memorial. ... [12] Of all the thirteen terms found in old documents, the word `runholder' was the most used, and it is the word that I think should be substituted.
