Quote: Next came the New Zealand Rifle Brigade from Mersa Matruh, first the 2nd Battalion, nicknamed the `Square Dinks' (a `square dinkum bloke' being idiomatic Australian for a genuine fellow) from the distinctive black patch on the upper sleeve; later the `Diamond Dinks', who wore a diamond patch and had been in action with British and Sikhs in the defeat of the Senussi on Christmas Day. The alternative name of the Rifle Brigade, the E.L.O. (the Earl of Liverpool's Own) had been quietly allowed to lapse.
