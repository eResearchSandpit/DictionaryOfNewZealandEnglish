Notes: Jim writes : Not in DNZE or overseas dictionaries available to me. the British equivalent may be <i>summer flu</i>, a term I have seen in English fiction but itself not in dictionaries. <i>Summer sickness</i> has perhaps become less common with the ubiquity of refrigeration.I recall press references to it in the 50s and 60s.  It is also more medically diagnosed these days - e.g. it is attributed to salmonella or campylobacter or even giardia. It has been associated with the collection of rainwater from house roofs - that can be contaminated by bird droppings.

Quote: .. our usually filled to overflowing Chemistry 1 lecture had only about 20 students present. On enquiring why, my New Zealand friend said in a hushed, embarrassed voice that it was "summer sickness". adding that the citizens of Auckland were laid low every year with this. I asked her what summer sickness was, and she quietly told me it was vomiting and "the runs".
