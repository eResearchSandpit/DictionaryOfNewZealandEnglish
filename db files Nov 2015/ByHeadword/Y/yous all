Quote: [Pakeha speaks]  He said, `Can't we just leave it at that then? Can I buy yous all a beer?' `Why did you say yous all?' ... `Is it because you think that's a Maori way of talking? Are we supposed to fall in love with you because you suddenly start talking Maori English like we do - or like you suppose we do?'
