Quote: ...this spring, I once again travelled between the southern Catlins and Moeraki, watching yellow-eyed penguins - or yeps as they are acronymically called - at every opportunity... "Yellow-eyeds are contagious," Nancy Gee, a retired nurse and wildlife ranger told me in Curio Bay. [94] "Yeps are remarkably resilient creatures," the trust's project officer, David Blair, tells me as we walk under the volcanic pyramids of Okia Reserve checking mustelid traps... The sponsorhip, though continuing, has been substantially reduced, and the trustees find themselves once again hawking the yep's cause.
