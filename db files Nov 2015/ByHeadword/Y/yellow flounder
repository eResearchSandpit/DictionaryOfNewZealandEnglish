Quote: The Black or River Flounder of New Zealand  (<i>Rhombosolea retiaria</>). The river-flounder is one of the common edible fishes of Wellington. Though not so common as either the yellow or sand flounder, it is much in demand as the chief delicacy among all species of flat fish eaten by the New Zealand public.
