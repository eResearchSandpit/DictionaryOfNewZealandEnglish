Quote: <i>YELLOW WEEVER</i> (Yellow cod) <i>Parapercis gilliesi</i> ... Like the blue cod the yellow weever is a temperate water representative of a widespread tropical fish family and although sometimes called the yellow cod it is not related to the true cods (Gadidae) or the morid cods (Moridae). ... Colour varies from cream to yellow ... Like the blue cod it is restricted to New Zealand waters.
