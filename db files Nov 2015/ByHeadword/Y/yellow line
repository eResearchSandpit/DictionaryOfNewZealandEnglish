Notes: Jim writes: in BritE a <i>yellow line</i> is one at the edge of a road and indicates parking restrictions. It may be single or double (NSOD and Collins). In NZ the corresponding line is always a broken line, and the primary denotation of yellow line is one painted along the middle of a road immediately to the left of the centreline, indicating that crossing the centreline is prohibited.
