Notes: Miss Parkin writes (19/9/1999) that she did her country service at a school about 8 miles from Hawera and when a child brough a bird's nest to school,he said it had 'youngkies'in it. She thought it might be regional. I went to school 18m south of Hawera and we certainly called baby birds youngkies, although I might have spelt it "younkie."  We also called them "younks".
