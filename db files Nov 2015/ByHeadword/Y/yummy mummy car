Quote: Boom boom - and bang. That's the sound of the hefty door on a $94,000 Discovery Land Rover 2003, the kind of four-wheel drive that makes columnist Frank Haden writhe, a Yummy Mummy car designed for the off-road, bought by the in-crowd... "I can look down on chicks' laps while driving," says Greg Grieves.. another Honda CRV driver who's sold on the 4WD experience. He's a Yummy Daddy, a Ponsonby father of two whose last car was an Audi S6.
