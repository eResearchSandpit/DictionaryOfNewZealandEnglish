Quote: One has noticed in some reviews of Young Adult Fiction published in your weekly, a tendency for otherwise excellent critics to tut-tut over the fact that some protagonists may be persons with problems... One has even read accusations in another publication that writers of YA fiction who present such porotagonists are somewhow guilty of depriving our children of their childhood"... But to imply that all such re-creations of the world should be frowned upon in YA books ... dare one whsiper the words "double standard"?
