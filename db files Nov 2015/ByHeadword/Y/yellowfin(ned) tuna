Tuna were generally known as `tunny' until the discovery of a potentially big export market to America, where tuna is rated a luxury fish. The name as then changed to conform with that used in America. Since then Southern Bluefin tuna, Yellowfin tuna and Striped, or Skipjack, tuna have been developed into important export fishes. In New Zealand the Albacore has become an important commercial fish.
