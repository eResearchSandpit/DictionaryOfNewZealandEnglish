Quote: However many roles Tem[uera Morrison] has had, two have stuck. Dr Ropata in <i>Shortland Street</i>, which spawned the derisively, much-quoted, "You're not in Guatemala now, Dr Ropata", a line he rolls playfully round his tongue, and Jake the Muss.

Quote: In New Zealand it's like once you've been on <i>Shortland Street</i>, you're forever known as that guy from <i>Shortland Street</i>. Temuera Morrison will always be Dr Hone Ropata, no matter how long he was in Guatemala.

Quote: "You're not in Guatemala now, Dr Ropata", May 25, 1992: because it's up there with "I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more" as a pop culture expression of existential unease.

Quote: "You are not in Derbyshire now, Mr Markham," Chief Manahau's righthand man tells Sam at one point. An intentional homage, surely, to <i>Shortland Street's</i> - and possibly New Zealand drama's - greatest expression of the existential unease of life at the end of the world. The immortal "You are not in Guatemala now, Dr Ropata."
