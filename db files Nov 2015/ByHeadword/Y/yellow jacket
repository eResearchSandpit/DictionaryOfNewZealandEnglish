Quote: Many liberated convicts found their way birth during the great rush from Australia in 1862. Those `expirees' are seldom found here in such good positions as is frequently the case in some of the Australian Colonies. I have only heard of one or two men of substance in New Zealand of whom rumour said that they, or their not by any means remote ancestors, had worn the `yellow jacket'. I have in my sojourn in the colony met with a few who were admittedly `old hands', as the phrase is.
