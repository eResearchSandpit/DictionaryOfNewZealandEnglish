Quote: The Wellington writer is, after all, being interviewed about his book <i>Yank Tanks: The Cars We Dreamed Of</i>... <i>Yank Tanks</i> concentrates on the period from 1949-1970, the era McCrystal regards as the height of American automotive style... "When you glanced in the rearview mirror of your Dorset as it strained up a hill and flinched at the sight of a set of heavy chrome teeth grinning at you as the V8 of some American dream machine chafed in your wake, the sour grapes hardened to hostility," McCrystal writes. Hence the term "Yank tank" entered the post-war idiom, coined from "one part disrespect, 10 parts envy."
