Quote: [Queen Charlotte Sound] The food of the New-Zealanders is chiefly fish, some of which they dry and some they eat raw: They also have some yams upon the northern Island, but not in lenty; ...  [ed. note Helen M. Gilkey 237] Yam, <i>Dioscorea</i> spp. Dioscoreaceae. The word `yam', as used in the Pacific Islands, commonly refers not to a form of sweet potato, as in America, but to a species of  Dioscorea which belong to a completely unrelated plant family. One wonders, however, if Ledyard in his reference to yams in New Zealand ... did not mean the sweet potato; for in Hooker's Handbook of New Zealand Flora, ...1864, no mention is made of the presence of <i> Dioscorea</i> in these islands at that time, but of the sweet potato <i> (Ipomoea batatas</i> Poir.) it is said, `now much cultivated in New Zealand'. Certainly, however, throughout most (if not all) his journal, Ledyard uses `yam' in its ordinary South-Pacific connotation. Several species of  Dioscorea were used by the inhabitants of various islands visited during the expedition, some being cultivated. All, apparently, had previously been introduced from Malaya.

Quote: The marketable produce of these islands, and of the seas over which they are so widely scattered, consists cheifly [sic] of beche de la mer .. besides vegetable productions, such as the yam, the sugar-cane, the bread-fruit, and the cocoa-nut, which denote a soil and climate similar to those of our most valuable Tropical possessions.
