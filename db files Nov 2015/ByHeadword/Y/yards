Quote: A large clearing opened out on the right, and a little way back from the road-line stood a slab hut - or whare [e-acute], as it is generally called in New Zealand - of a rather better appearance than ordinary, from the iron chimney of which issued the smoke which the travellers had seen. Farther back from the road were yards and a larger building evidently used as a wool-shed.
