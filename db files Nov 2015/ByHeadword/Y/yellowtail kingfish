Quote: <i>Yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi </i>... The world-wide distribution and naming of yellowtails is not completely clear, ... The name yellowtail is widely used internationally, and southern yellowtail is recommended for the New Zealand fish. However the name kingfish is well established and unlikely to be discarded, although it is potentially confusing, being also applied to a number of related and unrelated species in different countries. Yellowtail kingfish is perhaps a reasonable compromise.
