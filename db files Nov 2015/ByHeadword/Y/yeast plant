Quote: STINK WEED ([<i> Navarettia] squarrosa</i>), [formerly named <i> Gilis squarrosa</i>] and called Californian stink weed, digger's weed and yeast plant, occurs chiefly [in river beds] on dry pastures and cultivated fields in Marlborough and Otago, where it sometimes becomes dominant over all other herbage.  0
