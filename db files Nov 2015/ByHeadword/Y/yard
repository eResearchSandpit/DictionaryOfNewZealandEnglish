Quote: We had to run out docking nets on to posts that were in the ground ready to make the holding yard for the shepherds to yard into .. As they did not flap in the wind like docking scrim, it was easier to yard sheep up against them.

Quote: I yoked up the bullocks. The bullock yoke was a square piece of white pine smoothed and hollowed out to fit the necks of the two bullocks, with holes for the iron bows which went round the neck and through the yoke, being fastened above with a key tied with a bit of greenhide; in the centre a bolt with a ring called `the start' passed through the yoke, to which the chain was fastened from the sledge. <i>IBid.</i> Dec 18 p. 43. At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

Quote: How oft have the audience in that hallowed edifice felt the tear of sympathy trickle down their cheeks, while listening to the affecting accounts eloquently related of the activity of their New Zealand agents, when chasing the wild Maori amongst woods, rivers, and mountains, until caught like wild pigs or cattle, and with difficulty brought in and yarded for a few days, when the magic zeal of the agents has not only tamed them so as to allow them to run loose, but remodeled them into pure and undefiled Christians?
