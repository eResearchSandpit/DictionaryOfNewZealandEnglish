Quote: There is scarcely a more splendid sight to behold than a New Zealand forest. In the one we now entered, we did not perceive any kouri, or yellow pine-trees; but the totara [a's-acute], or red pine, grew in vast abundance. ... The rito, and innumerable other palm-trees, were in great quantity. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/387 The tree which has hitherto attracted most attention has been the <i>Kauri or yellow pine </i>(pinus Australis) g. coniferae; ... <i>Ibid.</i> 2/388 Cook made this valuable timber known, no attempt was made to secure a cargo till 1820, when the store ships `Dromedary and Coromandel', werre sent expressly from England, and a small vessel, the `Prince Rupert', from Sydney. Few kauri spars were secured, their lading consisting principally of the inferior white pine kahikatea, and this injured the name of the kauri.'
