Quote: <i> Yellow-tail</i>, ... The name is given in Victoria to the fish <i> Caranx trachurus</i>, Cuv. and Val.; the <i> Horse-Mackerel</i> (q.v.) of England. In New South Wales, it is <i> Trachurus declivis</i>, a slightly different species, also called <i> Scad</i>; but the two fish are perhaps the same. . . . Scraenidae in New Zealand, the word is used for the fish <i> Latris lineata</i>, of the family of Sciaenidae, and is also a name for the <i> King-fish, Seriola lalandii</i>, and for the <i> Trevally</i>.

Quote: The only true mackerels recorded from Canterbury are the Pacific Bonito (<i> Sarda chiliensis</i>) and the large-scaled Tunny (<i> Gasterochisma melampus</i>) which may reach a length of 6 feet; but a related family includes the well-known Barracouta (<i> Thyrsites atun</i>), the King Barracouta, <i> Jordanidia solandrii (o</i> ften known locally as Kingfish, but not to be confused with the North Island Kingfish which is a form or Yellowtail) and the elongated, silvery-hued frost fish (<i> Lepidopus caudatus</i>) whose curious stranding habits can hardly yet be said to be satisfactorily explained.

Quote: I saw a huge kingfish, so the boatman called it. ... If he was not a regular old yellowtail, belonging to the family <i> seriola</i>, then I missed my classification, The boatmen call this species kingfish; but kingfish belong to the mackerel family, and there was no mackerel about this fish.

Quote: YELLOWTAIL The name given overseas, (and in the famous annual Bay of Islands international fishing contest), to our Northern Kingfish (<i> Seriola grandis</i>). Not applied to the Southern Kingfish (<i> Jordanidia solandri</i>) however, who is our sometime Hake of South Island waters. See Kingfish. `Yellowtail' is also a common name given to the Koheru in the north.
