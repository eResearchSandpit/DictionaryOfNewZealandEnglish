Quote: New Zealand butterflies and moths are likewise graced with pretty names. There's the Red Admiral (above), known in Maori as the Kahukura or "red cloak"; and the Yellow Admiral, aka the Kahukowhai or "yellow cloak."

Quote: This yellow admiral butterfly (Vanessa itea) is feeding on nectar. Specimens were first collected in 1769-70, when Captain James Cook circumnavigated New Zealand in the Endeavour. These butterflies are strong fliers, and are found throughout most of the country, including Stewart Island. They also occur in Australia, and it is thought that they make regular crossings of the Tasman Sea.

It prefers open country, wastelands and gardens where stinging nettle - this species' first choice of food plant - has become established. The Yellow Admiral is often seen flying with the slightly larger Red Admiral. With a wingspan of 48-55mm, the Yellow Admiral is a strong flier.
