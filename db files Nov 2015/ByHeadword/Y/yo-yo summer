Quote: [Hdg] Forecasters warn of yo-yo summer. We've all heard of "El Nino" and more recently the "weather bomb" - now we can look forward to the "yo-yo" summer. MetService spokesman Bob McDavitt says that the front that has brought heavy rain and strong winds over the North Island is part of a "yo-yo" summer. Like a yo-yo, the weather goes up and goes down.

Quote: When late last month the MetService described a "yo-yo" weather pattern, most people interpreted that as good weather interspersed with bursts of bad, which is typical for the region. But this yo-yo no longer seems to retract. Its string has unwound and it is dangling.
