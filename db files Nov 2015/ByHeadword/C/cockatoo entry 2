Quote: [The squatter's enemy] the land-purchaser, of whom there were two classes - the one generally from Australia who swallowed up the ground where the squatter stood; and `cockatoos', as the station-owners call the other, who `spotted' his run all over with fifty and 100 acre sections, and worried him for trespass.

Quote: In one of our rides ... we suddenly dropped down on what would be called in England a hamlet, but here it is designated by the extraordinary name of a `nest of cockatoos' ... [110] These small farmers [who have started from next to nothing] are called Cockatoos in Australia by the squatters or sheepfarmers who dislike them for buying up the best bits of land on their runs; and say that, like a cockatoo, the small freeholder alights on good ground, extracts all he can get from it, and then flies away to `fresh fields and pastures new.' ... [111] However, whether the name is just or not, it is a recognized one here; and I have heard a man say in answer to a question about his usual occupation `I'm a Cockatoo.' ... The Cockatoos are `nobody's business' [that is, their interests are looked after by no one in particular].

[21] THE LEVANTING COCKATOOS./ In summer time, when work was slack/ .../ ... says C. to Jack,/ `Let's go a cockatooing'./ They leased some land upon the plain/ On very easy terms,/ And wrote Home to anxious friends/ About their stock and farms./

Quote:  [v. squatter] Much of the land in Canterbury is all freehold, but the land held by lease is generally protected by the owners buying up the river frontages. So that the Cockatoos cannot get water, I believe there is a sort of fight going on here just the same as there was in Victoria during the `65 Land Act' between squatters and cockatoos.

Quote: Many words in daily use in Otago bear traces of importation from the neighbouring Australian colonies, and none betrays its Australian origin more than that used to denote the agricultural class who are usually styled `cockatoos.' Important as they are, the cockatoos are not so interesting from a literary point of view, as the miners.

Quote: ~ (1) Bird-name. The word is Malay, <i>Kakatua.</i> (O.E.D.') -->(2) A small farmer, called earlier in Tasmania a Cockatooer (q.v.). The name was originally given in contempt (see quotations), but it is now used by farmers themselves. <i>cocky</i> is a common abbreviation. Some people distinguish between a <i>cockatoo</i> and a <i>ground-parrot</i>, the latter being the farmer on a very small scale. Trollope's etymology (see quotation, 1873) will not hold, for it is not true that the cockatoo scratches the ground. After the gold fever <i>circa</i> 1860, the selectors swarmed over the country and ate up the substance of the squatters; hence they were called <i>Cockatoos</i>. The word is also used adjectivally.

Quote: In the southern Provinces there was fierce competition between the pastoral tenants and the `cockatoos', a name for small farmers which originated in Australia by analogy with the swarms of birds which descended on the land of the luckless farmer at harvest time. It has persisted in New Zealand to the present day in the term `cow cockies' for dairy farmers.

Ibid. 53 The second rural class with whom the gentry were in direct economic contact were the independent farmers - the cockatoos. Ibid. 146. Differences in fortune between large land-owner and cockatoo were much less obvious than they had been in the nineteenth century.
