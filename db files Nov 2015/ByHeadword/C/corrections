Notes: Jim Cameron writes: Used in recent legislation and admimnistration to denote the penal system.There is a <i>Department of Corrections</i> and <i> community corrections</i> (non-custodial punishments - see Criminal Justice Amendment Act 1993, S.48). DNZE notes under <i>probie</i> that the term community corrections replaces <i>probation service</i>. This was my belief but probation service is commonly used in the press e.g. <i>NZ Herald</i> 29/3/2000. A specific use of the general term <i>correction</i> for punishment. Recorded in NZ Oxford Paperback.
