Quote: Wellington was a culture shock for Te Coasties, Rapai Te Hau and Dale Ferris when they moved down here from Gisborne... Te Coasties are hard to categorise and as a result they accept comparisons to The Topp Twins as inevitable... Te Coasties play to stereotypes and the main target is themselves. Running gags include references to East Coast staples, Steinlager and marijuana.
