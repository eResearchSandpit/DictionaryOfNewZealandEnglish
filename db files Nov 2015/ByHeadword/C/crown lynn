Quote: An emigre from Holland, Carpay arrived in Auckland in 1955 and took up a position at Crown Lynn, then at the high point of its most innovative period... Crown Lynn didn't really know what to do with him, but Carpay quickly turned out a series of elegant, linear hand-painted ceramic designs - 175 in six months.
