Quote: NEW ZEALAND MEGRIM or WITCH (MAHUE) <i>Caulopsetta scaphus </i>(Bloch and Schneider). In Napier it is known as Lantern-fish, but for what reason I am unable to say, unless it is from the peculiar transparency when it/is held up to a strong light. Another name given to this useless fish by local fishermen, in Port Chalmers at least, was that of Cadger's-fish.

Quote: All [Flatfish] are excellent food fish - again with the exception of the megrim, once dubbed `cadgers'-fish' because of its suitability for palming off on those who hover round landing fishing-craft in the hope of perks, especially flatfish!
