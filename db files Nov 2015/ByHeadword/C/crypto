Quote: Cryptosporidium is an animal present on Earth in uncountable numbers... The only good news is that they can't handle rejection, making little effort to combat the body's immune system.That's a good thing for the crypto, too, as they reproduced so fast that if not rapidly, and usually explosively, excreted, they would kill every host species and themselves.
