Quote: If an unfortunate new chum ventures mildly to protest against some trifling hardships he is at once silenced by being told that it is evident he is not `colonised' yet, and that he must get used to such things. If any particular philologist should read this, he will probably object to the word colonised in place of the more correct but uglier colonialised, but he would find it a vain task to attempt to argue the colonists into the use of any other.

Quote: There's an Auckland proverb, that a new chum never does any good until his nose has grown. ... After inhaling this magnificent air of ours for a year or two, your nose will grow bigger to receive it; and about the same time you will have spent the money you bought with you, gone in for hard work, learnt common sense, and become `colonised.'
