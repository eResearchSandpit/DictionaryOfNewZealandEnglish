Quote: .. lessees have been given continued grazing rights over some 18% of this new conservation land including mountain tops and fragile alpine herbfields. One proposal would allow the lessee to continue to graze sheep on the mountain tops of new conservation land for 21 years! Write to Lands Minister .. for grazing licences to not be issued over large areas of new conservation land.
