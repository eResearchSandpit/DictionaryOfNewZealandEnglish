Quote: Figures.. show two New Zealanders are paying child support for 11 children, four are contributing toward the upkeep of 10 youngsters, 13 are helping to support nine, and 40 are paying for eight... Citing privacy, Inland Revenue would not provide personal information about those paying child support - money paid by parents living away from their children - or how much they were paying.
