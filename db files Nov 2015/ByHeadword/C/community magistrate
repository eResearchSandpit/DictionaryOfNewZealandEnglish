Quote: Originally district courts were intermediate courts created in 1858; they were squeezed out between the Supreme Court (now the High Court) and the magistrates courts and were formally abolished in 1925.) The latest episode of this serial is the creation in 1998 of community magistrates to sit in district courts and exercise minor criminal jurisdiction.  They are not defined with any reference to JPs.
