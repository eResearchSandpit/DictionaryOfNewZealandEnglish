Quote: The first covenant in 1987 was a 1.67 hectare fenced block, which includes a historic Maori drawing on limestone of the ancient wedge-tailed eagle now extinct. Another covenant is an 85 hectare block, including an area of valley, stream, bush and limestone cliffs which have been referrred to in European times as the Valley of the Moa.
