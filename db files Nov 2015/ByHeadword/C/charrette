Quote: The French word, "Charrette" means "cart" and is often used to describe the final, intense work effort expended by art and architecture students to meet a project deadline. This use of the term is said to originate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris during the 19th century, where proctors circulated a cart, or "charrette", to collect final drawings while students frantically put finishing touches on their work.

Quote: A consultant team was appointed by Council this month. They have been asked to independently develop and run a design "charrette". Charrette is a French word used by architects and urban designers to describe a process that is creative, which operates with community input, but under pressure and with a high degree of focus... If support continues, then the team will proceed to the second stage - the holding of a design "charrette" probably some time in November.
