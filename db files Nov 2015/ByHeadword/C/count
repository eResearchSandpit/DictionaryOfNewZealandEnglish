Quote: Count is sufficiently strongly inherited to breed a particular count with some degree of certainty - or at least the range of count in the ewe flock can be kept within limits which ensure that the most profitable fleeces are being produced. As the rams have been well fed and are males, it is wise to select for a count coarser than the wool required for the ewe flock.
