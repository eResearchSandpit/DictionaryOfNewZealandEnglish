Quote: Probably all the worst weeds of the earth have already arrived, and we cannot expect newcomers that would rival the couch-grass (<i>Agropyron repens</i>), the sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>), or the so-called `Californian thistle' (<i>Cnicus arvensis</i>). At the same time, any farmer who sees a new plant on his farm should look at it askance, obtain what information he can get respecting it, and eradicate it at once if he has any reason to suspect it of having the weed-assuming characteristics. [fn] This plant is a native of the British Islands, Europe generally, north Africa, and northern to western Asia. It is only naturalised in the United States, where, however, it is called the `Canada thistle.' In England it is known as the `corn thistle' and `creeping thistle,' and is a weed of either cultivated or waste ground.
