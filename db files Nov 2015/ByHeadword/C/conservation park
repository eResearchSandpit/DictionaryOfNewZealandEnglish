Quote: New conservation parks are planned to protect the natural values of the high-country. Conservation land is being set aside during a process called Land Tenure Review. High country run holders who usually hold their land on a perpetual lease now have the opportunity to freehold the better pastures. In return, sensitive and valued conservation areas are set aside as Crown reserves. Valley floors tend to remain farmed while higher country is protected.
