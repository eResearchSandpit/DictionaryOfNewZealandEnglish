Quote: One type of dropper coming into widespread use is the chain dropper. These consist of lengths of chain, made of 12 gauge galvanised-iron wire, spaced about 3 ft. apart along the fence and fastened to the fence wires by patent fasteners. Barbed wire is used for the top and bottom wires, the barbs keeping the chain droppers in place along the fence wires. The use of the new angle steel fence posts with the chain droppers gives a fence with all the advantages mentioned above, and at the same time one that is much cheaper than a conventional fence.
