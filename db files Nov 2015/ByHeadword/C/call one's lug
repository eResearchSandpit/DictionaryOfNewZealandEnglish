Pronunciation:
Notes: (the point of the expression is, I think, is call, which may mean `shout in ; call into' perhaps confused with the quasi-transitive form of `call (a person's) bluff'. The expression as a whole, however, may mean something like `bite (a person's) ear off ; chew the lug off' - `talk pointedly' sarcastically too much and too loud; nag viciously').
