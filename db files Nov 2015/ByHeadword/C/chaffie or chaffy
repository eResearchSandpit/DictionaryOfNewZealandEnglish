Quote: 'A good deal was said in Court on Tuesday during the hearing of a case about threshing-machines, and no little amusement was caused by a list given by one witness of the 'technical' names of titles of some of the workmen employed about them.  'Chaffy' and 'baggy' raised a smile merely, but 'straw walloper' tickled everybody except the witness, who glanced around with an air of pity on the laughing faces of those who were ignorant of the designation of the man who attends to the straw elevator.  Some machines, it appears, boast of two 'straw wallopers', others are content with one'.

Quote: Today I was No. 4 of the crew of a header harvester, which however was not heading but threshing from the stack. Fifty years ago I would have been No. 12, `Chaffy', the dirtiest and most despised member of the gang, dragging my loads away on a bag sheet, and with no hot shower ahead of me when we finished.

Quote: The usual gang for stack threshing [c1900] was 12 men. The boss kept steam up and attended to the mill adjustments and lubrication, three men worked in the bag hole, the bag-rammer, the bag-sower, and the bag-carrier; two men were on top of the mill, a band cutter and a man to turn the sheaves to the band cutter: two men were on the stack forking to the `turner', and then there was the chaffy, two men on the straw stack, a builder and a straw `walloper' and last of all, the water joey. Threshing out of the stock required an even larger gang, usually about three more men. ... [When the threshing mill was working] the `chaffy' driving one horse in `chaffstick' brought round threshed straw to the bag hole end to make a bed and cover for the heap of [full wheat] bags.
