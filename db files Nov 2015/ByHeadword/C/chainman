Quote: When a man saw his wife and another man sitting naked in his bed drinking wine `I just exploded, and the gun went off', Peter Douglas Gillies said in the Dunedin High Court yesterday. Gillies, 30, chainman, was giving evidence in his trial for the murder of Thomas Craig Taggart at Alexandra on October 30 last year. Asked why he had exploded, he said he thought it was because of the wine.
