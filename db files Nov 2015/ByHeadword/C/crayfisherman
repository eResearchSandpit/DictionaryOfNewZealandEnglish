Quote: Des did what he reckons almost every crayfisherman does; he bought home a feed of `shorties' (illegal-sized crayfish) for his mates. It was to be a treat, Southland hospitality. It was a generous feed Des planned on giving them. A fisheries inspector was on the wharf at Riverton when Des returned. The inspector seized the sacks of `shorties'.
