Quote: I was in Auckland attending the session of the Genl. Assembly. I went as representative of Omata, a district possessing now, 5 houses and a stockade. To add to the pleasures of the war we had a desperate political conflict. The two parties which divide us are the Ultra provincial and the General Govt. parties called opprobriously the Centralisers. The difference ... is no doubt the old difference under a new face, England or America?
