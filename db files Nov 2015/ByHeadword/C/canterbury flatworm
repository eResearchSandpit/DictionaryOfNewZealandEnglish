Quote: And just what is this terror by night? None other than our native Canterbury flatworm!... The Canterbury flatworm, <i>Artioposthia triangulata</i>, is a relatively shy little bush-dwelling creature at home and has only revealed these alarming habits since some entered Britain - it is thought with a shipment of plants from Banks Peninsula - around 1963.
