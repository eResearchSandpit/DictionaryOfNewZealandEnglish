Quote: The story of the black robin's rescue from a deteriorating habitat on Little Mangere and of its establishment on Mangere Island in 1976 is famous. The cross-fostering techniques using Chatham Island warblers on Mangere and Chatham Island tits on South East Island are experiments that have excited the conservation world.
