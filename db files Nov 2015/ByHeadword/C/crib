Quote: West Cost `crib', defined as a `cut lunch', is a definite plus for the editor, though he might also have noted the extension of its meaning to cover `lunch hour', for it was a running argument over the time taken for the miners' crib which led to trouble in the Blackball mine.

Quote: The miners always carried their food (crib) to work in a specially designed tin box called a crib tin, together with an enamelled tea billy equipped with a drinking mug. The crib tin was necessary in the damp conditionsm because the mine was overrun with rats as big as bulldogs. The miners looked for a dry spot in a worked-out section of tunnel in which to leave their gear. This was known as the `crib cuddy'. <i>Ibid.</i> 30 When Dad was chopping in the bush ..., Pud and I would often take his `crib' out to him. This would usually consist of hot scones, hot pie, and bread.
