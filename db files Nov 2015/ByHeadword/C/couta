Quote: ... I amused myself catching barracouta ... When travelling fast through the water, it [sc. the board with a nail in it] resembles a fish, and the 'coota goes for it open-mouthed. ... Directly the line is slackened on deck the 'coota lets go the bait, which is dropped over for the next victim.
