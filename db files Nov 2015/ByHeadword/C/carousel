Quote: I have just watched the afternoon milking of 350 cows. It took about an hour in a rotary shed that has more in common with the Sydney Opera House than with John Scott's old herringbone shed... One at a time, the cows boarded a huge, slow merry-go-round capable of holding 66 animals and stood side by side like slides in a carousel, heads facing the centre. <i>Ibid.</i> 39 A few metres away, Danny Woodcock, the sharemilker, removed cups from the cows as the carousel completed its circuit.
