Quote: ... the `crush' - a race perhaps ten yards in length and just wide enough for a grown beast to pass through. ... beyond the [drafting] gate the race terminated in the crush itself, the end being blocked by a rudely constructed bail. This was so designed that a horned beast could just get its head through the open bail ... the hinged arm pulled across and the ... animal locked behind the ears ... a further hinged rail ... swung over forcing and pinning its head down into a forked stump.' [cf illustr p94]
