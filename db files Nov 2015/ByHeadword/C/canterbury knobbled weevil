Quote: University of Canterbury masters student Laura Young made the discovery of a lifetime recently - she found a weevil thought to be extinct since 1922 living in Burkes Pass, South Canterbury. Laura was studying Aciphylla (speargrass/spaniards) in the Burkes Pass Scenic Reserve last month as part of her Masters degree in ecology when she stumbled across the Canterbury knobbled weevil.
