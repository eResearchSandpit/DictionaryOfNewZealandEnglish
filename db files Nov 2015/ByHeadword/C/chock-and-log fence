Quote: The `Canadian' (or chock-and-log) fence was also made of tree trunks, four logs being placed one on top of the other ... At either end short transverse pieces were placed between each log. The short crosswise chocks had a concave section chopped out top and bottom so that the fence logs would remain firm and not roll.
Notes: (Hargreaves `Farm Fences')
