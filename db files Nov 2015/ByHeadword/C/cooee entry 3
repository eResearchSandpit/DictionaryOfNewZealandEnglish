Quote: Now then for the `Coo-ey'. This corresponds to our English Hoy! Halloa! but is infinitely more puzzling - for the Hoy and the Halloa are generally but preludes to an explicit expression in plain English of the wishes of the Hoyer or the Halloer to the Hoyee or Hallowee respectively. Coo-ey however is far more extended in its signification and is often expected to convey that signification in itself. Coo-ey can be heard for a very very long way - the `Coo-' is dwelt on for some time and the `ey' is brought out sharp and quick in high relief as it were from the Coo - and at an unnaturally high pitch. It requires some courage to give vent to a Coo-ey at first; the first attempts are generally abortive, not to say rather doleful and at the same time lucicrous; by and by however as one gains confidence one's Coo-eys are more successful; my own at present is quite unimpeachable though in [46] England nothing would have induced me to give utterance to such a noise on any consideration. The butcher boy is coming up with the meat. He Coo-eys a long way off and by the time he has got up to the house the door is opened to receive the meat and he goes on his way rejoicing ... There I cooeyed and then the Irishman came down the terrace and met us.
