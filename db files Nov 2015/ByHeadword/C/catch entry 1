Quote: catch: a sheep snatched from his pen by a shearer just before the bell. So, if there is one, he will take his cobbler as he can now shear it at a leisurely pace. He may, in order to time his catch, have previously chosen a rosella or perhaps someone had barrowed one for him. In thus timing his work, he is said to go for a catch.
