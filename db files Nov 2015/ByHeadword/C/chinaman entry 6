Quote: And then there was `Chinaman': `It was just a sort of follow-my-leader, but the trot was in imitation of the itinerant Chinese fruit vendors, of whom there were so many in the Auckland of those days. An interesting thing is that an old West Coaster told me he had seen children playing it on the Greenstone and at Red Jacks, both old Chinese diggings' (1900; Parnell, Auckland).
