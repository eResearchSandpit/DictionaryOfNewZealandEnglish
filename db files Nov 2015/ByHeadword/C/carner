Quote: `And Trevor was no longer `Trevour', but `Carner'. He was said to have tumbled to this title with Annette in his sleeping bag. <i>Ibid.</i> 199 She read about somebody being fined for carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen ... She didn't know <i>exactly</i> what it was, but she knew that a `carner' was a person who did it. [the writer is a non-NZder; shaky on idiom]
