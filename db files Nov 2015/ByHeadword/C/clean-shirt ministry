Quote: When cabinets were formed the southern gentry used to wonder which Aucklander was presentable enough to make minister. When Thomas Forsaith, a draper, was asked to call on the administrator about forming a ministry in 1854 he first went home from his store to change his clothes. His government was called the `clean shirt ministry'. It only lasted two days.
