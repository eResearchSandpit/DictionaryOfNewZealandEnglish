Quote: At present the canning industry is confined to mullet, of which there is a large amount exported, and an equal quantity used for home consumption. <i>Ibid.</i> 10 The Western Packing and Canning Company during 1899 slaughtered 43,000 sheep, averaging 54lb. each; 1,000 cattle, averaging 550lb.; with an output of 9,000 cases of tinned meats, and 640 casks of tallow.
