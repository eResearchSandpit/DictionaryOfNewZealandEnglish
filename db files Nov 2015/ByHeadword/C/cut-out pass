Quote: He got halfback Stacey Jones stationed at first receiver, throwing cutout-passes and bringing in secondary runners, and he had his three props... adding some footwork... ...

Amid a flurry of penalties from English official Steve Ganson, fullback Brent Webb shot across from another Jones cutout-pass and when Jones concluded the scoring with another penalty just before the hour, it was all over for the Australians.
