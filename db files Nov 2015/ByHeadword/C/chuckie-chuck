Quote: When out of breath, hot and thirsty, how one longed for a handful of chuckie-chucks. In their season how good we used to think these fruits of the <i>gaultheria,</i> or rather its thickened calyx. A few handfuls were excellent in quenching one's thirst, and so plentifully did the plant abound that quantities could soon be gathered. ... [The] notable [pioneer housekeepers] sometimes encouraged children to collect sufficient chuckie-chucks to make preserve.[sic] The result was a jam of a sweet mawkish flavour that gave some idea of a whiff caught in passing a hair-dresser's shop.
