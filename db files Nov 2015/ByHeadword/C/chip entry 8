Quote: During shearing at one station in the early days, the boss came along and gave him a chip for shearing roughly, and asked him how it was that he shore all right in the morning but got rough after dinner. `... Professional shearers ... shear to the chip and if they don't get a chip then shearings fall off ...'

Quote: Les always held to the opinion that if you did not get `chipped' at least once a day, you were shearing entirely for the boss. A `chip' meant you were on the borderline and shearing a few for yourself as well. ... He [the critical foreman] failed to show any sense of humour when Les ... replied: `I shore a few for myself that run'. [123] The shearing is below my standard of workmanship. ... You can take this as a general chip - or else.
