Quote: The victims of calf beating, as it is called, were always attacked by hinds other than their own mothers. Calf beating does not appear to be a general pattern of behaviour in all hinds, because in some herds no deaths from this phenomenon occur. Consequently, the calf beating is thought to have been due to the high stocking rate and the lack of cover provision.
