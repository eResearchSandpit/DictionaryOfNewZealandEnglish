Quote: The word the most employed is "compree";in French "compris" means understood.This word in the new abbreviated lingo isused in every phrase. If a peasant doesnot understand, he says "No compree";then they have trying explanationswithout end of patience.  Very often theyadd the word "that," which is not Frenchor Flemish, and becomes "Compree dat."
