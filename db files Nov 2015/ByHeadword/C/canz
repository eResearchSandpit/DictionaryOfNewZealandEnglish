Quote: Starting tomorrow the union, the Corrections Association of New Zealand (CANZ), will consult its 2200 members over the notice...  CANZ national organiser Brian Davies said when the armed forces and police were last used in 1996, prison officers were split into two main unions... This was not the case this time, with more than 90% of prison officers being CANZ members.
