Quote: [The] Characteristic signs of the species' [Kaka's] presence , especially when it was more abundant, were well-tended tracks, dusting bowls, and `chews'. All of these are exceedingly rare and local nowadays. The `chews' result from a peculiar method of feeding in which leaves such as those of mountain flax of tall tussock grasses are frayed and sucked and the fibrous residue is left hanging on the plant in a loose ball.
