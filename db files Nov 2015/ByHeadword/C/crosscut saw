Quote: The principal tools required [by the kauri bushman] were Yankee axes, cross-cut saws, and timber (not screw) jacks. <i>Ibid.</i> 173 Cross-cut saws have what is called a peg-tooth and cut both ways. It is a great improvement to sharpen every fifth tooth, counting from the centre to the ends, as a drag tooth, that is, a tooth filed square across and with a considerable hook, this arrangement tends to keep the cut clear of sawdust.
