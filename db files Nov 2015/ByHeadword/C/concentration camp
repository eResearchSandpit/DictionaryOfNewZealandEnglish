Quote:  ... at the end of some six weeks [of training in 1914] we marched out of those Showgrounds and entrained for a large concentration camp in the Wairarapa. <i>Ibid.</i>48-49 The women [sc. Cairo prostitutes, WW1] of the old area were examined, and those infected were immediately placed in a concentration camp, known as the `barbed wire', behind which she remained until she received a clean [49] bill of health. <i>Ibid.</i> 104 When the civilians who still stayed in Armentie`res saw the desecration of their church ... Many then began to leave for Paris, or the less fortunate for the concentration camps.
