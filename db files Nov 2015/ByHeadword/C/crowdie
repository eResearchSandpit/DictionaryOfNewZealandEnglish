Quote: [omitted from 1955 edn] Cottage Cheese or Crowdie. Use either old milk which has soured or add 1 teaspoon of rennet to 1 quart of fresh milk. Leave to thicken, cut into 1/2 inch pieces with a knife and put into a scalded linen cloth to drain. Scrape the inside of cloth occasionally to facilitate drainage and when all whey is removed mix in 1/2 teaspoon of salt to curd from 1 quart milk. Balls of this often are useful in salads or it makes a good base for sandwiches, or savoury biscuits, using any of the following: Lettuce, chives, cress, tomato, cucumber, pimento, chopped apple, pineapple, walnuts, peanuts, dates, raisins, figs, caraway seeds, etc.
