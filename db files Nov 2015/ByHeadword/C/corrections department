Quote: The Corrections Department blundered appallingly by not objecting to multiple sex-offender Taffy Hotene being paroled last April after serving eight years of a 12-year sentence for rape and other serious assaults... The Parole Board should be less willing to free dangerous criminals early and the Corrections Department should be quicker to pursue section 105 objections to early release.
