Quote: Haymaking. ... The jobs to look for are `cocking up' (with a two or three pronged fork), driving the horse rake (no handrakes are used nowadays) ... loading the drays or sledges when ready ... A `crow' is also employed, whose work consists of passing the fork-fulls thrown up by the carter to the stacker.
