Quote: On the Canterbury Plains in the early days, when all the runs were unfenced for many years, we used to find cabbage-tree or hermit sheep. These were merino sheep living alone, and having a cabbage-tree or a flax-bush for a mate or companion; and they could not be made to leave, always keeping within a certain radius of that special tree, which they considered their especial friend ... They could never be made to associate with flock sheep.
