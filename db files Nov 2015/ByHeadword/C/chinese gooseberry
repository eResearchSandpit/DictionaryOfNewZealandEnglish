Quote: I am a stranger in a strange land, where people park too near to street corners so that drivers must pull far out into oncoming traffic to see when the way is clear, where lunatics run red lights and this lawlessness goes unpunished, where a person dressed as a Chinese gooseberry dances outside a new supermarket to entice custom.

Quote: Few people imagined the Chinese gooseberry would become a runaway global success story, prized in Tokyo and served in ritzy restaurants throughout Europe when 30 years ago a handful of brave entrepreneurs planted the first commercial-colume vines around the Bay of Plenty.

Quote: The story, probably apocryphal, goes that an American wholesaler cabled back to a prospective New Zealand exporter some time in the 1960s saying Americans were not buying `Chinese gooseberries' because they assumed the fruit had been grown by the Communist Chinese. `Sell them as kiwifruit', came the telegrammed reply.
