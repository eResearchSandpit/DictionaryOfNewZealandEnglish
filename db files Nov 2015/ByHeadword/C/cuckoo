Quote: Two migratory <i>Cuckoos</i> visit New Zealand in summer from Australia and the southern islands, and depart in autumn. During the warm summer nights they sing sweetly. The Kohoperoa, one of these cuckoos, is about the size and colour of the sparrow-hawk; the Pipiwarauroa cuckoo is a much smaller and a more variegated-feathered bird.
