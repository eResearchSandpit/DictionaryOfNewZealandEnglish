Quote: Three years ago a group of leading producers of farmed venison made a bold move. Believing that the word "venison" conjured up something wild, gamy and tough, which weekend hunters might bring down from the hills and give away to friends, they decided to rename their meat... However, cervena was to be more than just a name. It was also to be a trademark that would guarantee quality. In addition, heeding the lesson learnt from kiwifruit growers after they renamed their product, the name cervena would also be registered as an appellation.
