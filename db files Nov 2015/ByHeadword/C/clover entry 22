Quote: SPOTTED BURR CLOVER (<i>Medicago arabica</i> formerly <i>M. maculata</i>), called also calvary clover and spotted medick, is very similar to the former species [small burr over], but there is almost always a large central spot on each leaflet. This species is commoner in the Auckland district than elsewhere.
