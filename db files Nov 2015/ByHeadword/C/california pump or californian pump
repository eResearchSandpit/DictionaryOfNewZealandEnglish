Quote: Pumping gear became more elaborate with the introduction, in the deeper paddocks, of the ingenious Californian pump. This comprised a long narrow box, open at each end but otherwise completely enclosed. Through it ran an endless canvas belt with wooden cleats fitting neatly into the inside of the box. The belt passed over rollers at the upper and lower ends of the box; the lower end was immersed in the flooded paddock and as the belt turned clockwise over its rollers the water was drawn up through the box and delivered to a tail-race. The motive power was commonly an overshot water-wheel.
