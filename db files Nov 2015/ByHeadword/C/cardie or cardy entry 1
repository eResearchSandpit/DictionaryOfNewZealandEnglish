They're those dinky little words we make up, like these: kiddies (children), cardies (cardigans), boatie (person who sails boats), yachtie (person who sails yachts), drinkies (drinks), bikies (people who get together to ride motorbikes), wrinklies (old people), rellies (relations), wellies (Wellingtons, as in gumboots), wallies (variation on wankers), littlies (children).

That is the word `naughty', for sexual intercourse.
