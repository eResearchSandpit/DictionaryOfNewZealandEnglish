Quote: The extinct <i>cavel</i> - the drawing of lots for places in the mire is anything but extinct. The <i>cavel</i> takes place every three months on the West Coast and, apart from the chance of a change, `the cavel day' is looked forward to by all at the mine as it involves a short, two-hour shift. Not only is this old north-country term alive, it still often retains its old north-country pronunciation `kay-vel'.
