Alone and unaided he scooped the wash-dirt into his cradle, which he vigorously rocked with his left hand, whilst with the right he ladled water from the river into the `hopper' or seive [sic]. ... He cast aside the `dipper', and hastened towards the eddy.

Quote: Like a child's cradle, [a miner's cradle] had two rockers fastened to its base, and it was rocked rather more violently. But internally the resemblance ended. It was, broadly speaking, an open box with the sides sloping inwards towards the base, and the bottom board extended about a foot beyond the end; while the end board, which formed one of the sides, did not reach to the bottom, but left an aperture. The box was fitted on top with an iron hopper punched full of quarter-inch holes and with sides about three inches high. It was into this hopper that the gold-bearing gravel was thrown, a shovelful at a time.

Quote: It took two men to work the cradle satisfactorily - one to shovel and one to rock it violently by means of a handle that was fastened up the back end of the contraption, and at the same time to dash water on to it by means of a dipper fastened to a stick. The cradle was always placed, of course, at the water's edge, and the stones that did not fall through the hopper were tipped out the front end, which was left without any retaining side. The material which was washed through the holes, and which contained the gold, fell straight down on to a sloping wooden table covered with a coarse piece of matting on which the gold was saved. The table was fitted firmly against the back and sides of the box, but stopped short about an inch from the front end to allow the tailings and what gold was not saved to fall on to another table - this one fitting firmly to the front end and the sides, and sloping dowm towards the back end. From there the tailings fell on to the back end of the bottom board, which was generally covered with coconut matting to catch any gold that might have gone all the distance, and followed along the bottom and out over the lip. By this means the wash had to travel a surprisingly long distance, and was also shaken from side to side of the cradle, so that there little chance if it was worked properly of losing any gold.
