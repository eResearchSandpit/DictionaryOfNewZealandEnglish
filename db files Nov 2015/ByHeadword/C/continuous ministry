Quote: The `Continuous Ministry' was `a name given to a shifting combination, or rather series of cmbinations, amongst public men, by which the cabinet was from time to time modified without being completely changed at any one moment.' [quoting 1898 Reeves Long White Cloud 335-336] ... [48] John Sheehan, one of the ablest ... debaters in the opposition, claimed that the most `inoffensive epithet' he could apply to the government [c1875] was that of the `continuous Government'. [NZPD 1875, 19, p. 60] The `Continuous Ministry' label was established by frequent reiteration. Samuel Hodgkinson ... flatly asserted: `this is a continuous Ministry. There may have been a new material put into it, but it is much the same Ministry as an old garment is the same garment though it has been patched from time to time.' [quoting NZPD, 1877, 26, p. 31]
