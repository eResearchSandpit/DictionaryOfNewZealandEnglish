Quote: Cattle, sheep and horses etc., are prevented from straying on the [railway] line by what is termed a `cattle-pit' or `catcher'. This is a pit sunk between the rails and fences about two feet six inches deep and ten inches wide, covered by bars of wood and placed parallel with the lines and about five inches apart.
