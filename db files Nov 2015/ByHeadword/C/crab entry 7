Quote: [=SWIMMING CRAB, =SURF CRAB, =SAND CRAB] The paddle crab (Ovalipes catharus) is also known as the swimming, surf or sand crab and lives mainly within 200 metres of the shore. It is particularly aggressive, emerging from the sand to nip the soles and toes of bathers, and the fingers of pipi diggers.
