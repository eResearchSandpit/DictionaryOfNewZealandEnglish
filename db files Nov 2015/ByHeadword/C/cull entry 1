Quote: <i>Cull:</i> (1) A broken-down old sheep. A sheep to be sold out of the flock for age, bad wool, or poor condition. As adj[ective],<i> cull</i> describes a ewe, wether, cow, etc., that has been marked for disposal. (2) To select, as above. (C.) 2. [In NZ the word developed into a euphemism for exterminate, esp. since the passing of the Noxious Animals Act 1954. Contrast OED2 4 b. spec. To select and kill (wild animals or birds), usu. in order to improve the stock ...] To exterminate noxious wild animals, esp. deer.
