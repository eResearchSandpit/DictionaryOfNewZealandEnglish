Quote: <i>[Aristotelia serrata (The Wineberry)]</i> ... In bush clearings, it is one of the first plants to come up, and would, on this account, be termed by the Americans a `fireweed.' [...] It goes by different names in different districts. In Otago, it is the New Zealand Currant, or `Moko-mok'. In Canterbury, it is called the Wine-berry. In the North Island, it is the Mako-mako.
