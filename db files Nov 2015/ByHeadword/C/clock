Quote: The "clock" in the days of solo butchering in the freezing works was the equivalent of the "ringer" in the shearing gang. The "clock" who was, however, not necessarily the fastest butcher, gave the signal for the butchers to dash into the pen and stick three animals. He waited then until the slowest of the butchers in the team had dressed their animals before he gave the word for a further foray to be made.
