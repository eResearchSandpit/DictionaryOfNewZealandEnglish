Quote: GUTZER, TO COME A: To `crash' or fall badly. (Originally an Air Force term with reference to an aeroplane.) Also used generally.  To get into serious trouble, e.g., `He's before a court martial and looks like coming a gutzer'. `Gutzer' is pre-war slang, and an old term among Scottish boys for falling flat on the water in diving, instead of making a clean header.
