Quote:  [<i>Calcutta Sweep</i> - Te Aroha] `The method of conducting a `Calcutta' differs entirely from the more common form of sweep. In a `Calcutta' subscripters are ... 1 pound each ... and are not governed by the number of horses in the race upon which the sweep is based. Slips of paper with the horses written on then placed in a hat and in another hat - names of subscribers. Promoter ... takes role of auctioneer ... each horse drawn offered at auction and sold to highest bidder ... full amount bid has only to be paid if the buyer is not the drawer of that particular horse. If the drawer should buy the horse in, then he pays only half the amount bid, and the money goes into the pool. If the buyer does not draw the horse, the amount bid is divided, half to the drawer and half to the pool.

Quote: [Reference 1928] Another memory of that meeting [at Springfield, c1928] is the `Calcutta Sweep'. This was a common practice in those days and now that it seems to be a thing of the past it might be worth describing. The evening before the event concerned the crowd would get together and every dog on the programme would be put up for `auction'. The proceeds of the `sale' would be pooled, divided into first, second and third money, and after the actual event was finished this went to the men who had `purchased' the placed dogs.

Quote: [The] system, known casually as the Calcutta sweep, is practised in most clubs round the country and makes amateur golfers wealthy men through golf as an amateur sport. Basically, the idea works on the system of paired golfers who compete for prize-money put up by their fellow club-members ... The pairs are deemed horses and are bought at local club auctions by other club members. And it is at those auctions that anything happens ... The competition is usually run on a match-play basis with the winning couple collecting half of what they have won while the `owner' who bought them gets the other half ... I know of one team that went for $3 all up and won a calcutta.
