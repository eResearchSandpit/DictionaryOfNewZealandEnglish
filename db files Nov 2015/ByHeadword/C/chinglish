Quote: These thoughts will occur to anyone who strolls down Glasgow Wharf, Wellington, and notes the yellow crew of the `British' ship Crown of Galicia, chartered by the New Zealand Shipping Company for trade in the Dominion waters. Some time ago `Truth' spoke with derision concerning the manner in which the [pounds]100 poll-tax was being dodged by wholesale desertions from vessels like this and it is gratifying to find that protests under this head have borne good fruit, for during the presence of the Chinglish trader in Wellington harbor[sic] no member of the yellow crew is permitted ashore, and two watchmen patrol the wharf from 6 p.m. till 6 a.m. with the same object.
