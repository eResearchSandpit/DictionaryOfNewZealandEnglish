Quote: Every two minutes or so the giant chopper surges out of the forest with a three-tonne log looming over the cleared skid site ... releasing the great tree butts with a thump ... Two men - the choker chasers - grab the swinging hook, trusting totally in the pilot not to dash their brains out ..., and attach a new cable.
