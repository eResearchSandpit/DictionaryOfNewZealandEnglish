Quote: TWIN CRESS (<i>Coronopus didymus</i>, formerly <i>Senebiera didyma</i>) is often called wart cress, but, as this name is given to at least two other species, I suggest dropping the name entirely and substituting twin cress as a good descriptive term;. . . This weed is also called swine cress, hog cress, and scurvy grass [and land cress].
