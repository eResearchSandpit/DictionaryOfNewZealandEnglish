Quote: Only four vehicles were in use on the island up until this time but by 1952 over 100 were in use. [59] Before the coming of motorised transport, the mode of transportation was the `Chatham Island Truck' (Konake), a wooden flat-decked horse or bullock-drawn vehicle, with iron or wooden wheels at the back and sledge runners on the front.
