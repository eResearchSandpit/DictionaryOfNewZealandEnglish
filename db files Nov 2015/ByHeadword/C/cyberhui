Quote: [Hdg] Cyber-hui may be repeated. Technology came face to face with "flaxroots" at an inaugural rural cyber-hui... About 100 representatives of Maori, social service, youth and cultural groups in Northland attended the one-day conference in Kaitaia. The cyber-hui is part of the Government's efforts to enable community access to information and communications technologies.
