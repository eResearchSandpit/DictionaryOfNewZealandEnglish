Quote: We were well mounted, and all our luggage consisted of my little travelling-bag ... and what is termed a `swag' in front of F--'s saddle; that is, a long narrow bundle, in this instance enclosed in a neat waterproof case, and fastened with two straps to the `D's,' which are the steel loops let in in four places to all colonial saddles, for the purpose of carrying blankets, &c.

Quote: <i>Colonial saddle:</i> (1) Made in the colonies. A <i>colonial saddle</i> has large knee pads, a very dipped seat, and numerous dees. (2) Noun use. Until about 1900 most New Zealand-born people spoke of themselves as <i>Colonials</i> where now I think they would call themselves New Zealanders. (C.)
