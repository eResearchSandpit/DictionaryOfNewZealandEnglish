Quote: As basketball in this country is growing so is the terminology to describe the sport. ... The power forwards are the muscle of the team. They work the paint (keyhole area usually painted a solid colour), collect all the garbage (missed shots or loose balls around the hoop, sorry basket) and chuck in the chippies (short easy shots).
