Quote: There are twenty-eight native species belonging to the genus <i>Odontria</i>, but all observers agree that the principal grass grub is <i>Odontria zealandica.</i> In the larval stage this is known as `grass grub,' `white grub,' or `curl grub,' and the adult stage is known as `grass grub beetle,' `brown beetle.' or `turnip fly.'
