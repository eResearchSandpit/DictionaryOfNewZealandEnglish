Quote: The lizards observed were divided into two categories (bronze and green) onthe basis of their dorsal colouration (Fig. 2) as it has been suggested that differences incolouration and patterning in Chatham Island skinks may indicate that there is morethan one species on Rangatira Island (M. Bell pers. comm.).

Quote: We examine the origin and post-colonization evolution of the Chatham Islands skink, Oligosoma nigriplantare nigriplantare, the sole reptile species occurring on the archipelago. We sampled O. n. nigriplantare from across nine islands within the Chatham Islands group, and representative samples from across the range of its closest relative, the New Zealand mainland common skink (Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma).
