Quote: [Paremoremo prison] Classification Block slowly evolved into a de-classification block. True, all new `Parry' residents were initially sent there for observation and assessment. But `Class' was also the home of prisoners who did not quite fit elsewhere - inmates who needed protection from others, those who could not cope with the stresses of prison life or men deserving punishment that stopped short of incarceration in D Block.
