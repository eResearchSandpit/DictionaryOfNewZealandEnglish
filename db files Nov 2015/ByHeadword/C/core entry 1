Quote: Consideration of a category B fund follows the creation last year of what is essentially a 'category A' fund, the Centres of Research Excellence (CORE) fund, which focuses on research excellence and collaboration between institutions...  But Thompson said a sufficient number of research programmes were already in place and included the COREs, the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology's consortia, the Venture Investment Fund, Industry New Zealand and a range of incubators linking industry to science.
