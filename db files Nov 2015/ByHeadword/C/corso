Quote: ... the correct full name of Corso since 1972 has been simply CORSO (Incorporated). Before then its name was the New Zealand Council of Organisations for Relief Services Oversea (Incorporated), from which the acronym Corso was formed. In 1972 the acronym became the legal name. Since 1972 the legal name CORSO (Incorporated) has been followed in the rules by a descriptive phrase, which is not part of the legal name.
