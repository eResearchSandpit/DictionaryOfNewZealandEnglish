Quote: Two parties were now [mid 1850s] developed in the colony; one was called Centralists, the other Provincialists. The former aimed at the incorporation of the provincial governments, with a view to their ultimate absorption, and maintained the right of the General Assembly to intermeddle in all provincial affairs.
