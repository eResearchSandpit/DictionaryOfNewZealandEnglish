Quote: Technically, SOEs can't die. They either get sold, or they reincarnate into CrOCs - Crown-Owned Companies. (That acronym should really be COCs, but gentility mandated an extra "r".)... Potentially, a CrOC could require government funding every year, just like a government department. TVNZ is the first to be reborn as a CrOC. And in NZ Post's current state, both financially and administratively, the only way to excuse its condition will be to at least pretend that it's more of a CrOC than an SOE.
