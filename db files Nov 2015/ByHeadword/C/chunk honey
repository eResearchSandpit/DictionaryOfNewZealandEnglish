Quote: Chunk Honey Production: A proftable sideline in bee-keeping.[hdg] A form of honey which has a great appeal to many people is that called 'chunk honey' in which large frames of comb honey are cut into strips and fitted into glass jars, the space around the strips being filled with light-coloured liquid honey.
