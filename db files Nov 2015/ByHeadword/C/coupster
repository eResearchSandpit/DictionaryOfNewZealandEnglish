Quote: ...Mr English's own "ship slip" over United States nuclear ship visits last week triggered a second wave of coupsters into action which precipitated the final blow... Within hours a raft of MPs were calling for a change at the top - something which became overheated and almost spooked the inner circle of coupsters who were beginning to wonder if they were managing one coup or two.
