Quote: `There's always strike talk. There always will be on big jobs like these. When you've got so many conditions covering so many different sections of the workers; when you've got height money, wet money, dirt money, gum-boot money; when you've got call-outs and twenty different opinions on what constitutes wet time; when men are rained off ...'
