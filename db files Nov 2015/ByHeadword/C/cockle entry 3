Quote:  [There are] great variety of testaceous and crustaceous fishes that almost cover the rocks under water, such as clams, muscles, oysters, crays, cuttles, limpets, wilks, gigantic muscles, a foot in length, cockles, sea-ears, sea-eggs, star-fish, mutton-fish, &c.; from the latter the pearl is procured which they insert in the eyes of their carved images and boxes.
