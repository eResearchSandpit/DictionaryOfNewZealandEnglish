Quote: MISHEARD, NOT MISS HERD: `That was a cowardly thing to do,' said Mr W.A. Harlow, S.M., sternly rebuking a man accused of assaulting his wife, in the Napier Magistrate's Court. A young reporter did not quite hear the remark, and in an evening newspaper, Mr Harlow was reported as saying: `That was a cow of a thing to do.' The following evening there was a correction under the heading, `What Mr. Harlow Really Did Say', and the dignity of the court was restored.
