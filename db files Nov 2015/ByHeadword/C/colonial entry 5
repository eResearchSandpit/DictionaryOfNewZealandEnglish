Until about 1900 most New Zealand-born people spoke of themselves as <i>Colonials</i>. where now I think they would call themselves New Zealanders. (C.)

Quote: There is another thing that will strike a new arrival forcibly. He finds that he belongs to a despised class, he is a `new chum', and, as such, he is supposed to be totally incapable of doing anything, though he probably imagined himself to be a rather clever fellow on the whole before. He very soon discovers that he really is a `new chum' in the true sense of the word; he cannot crack a stock whip, his first attempt probably causing the lash to come in severe contact with his own face ... in these and many other things he will find himself far from being up to the colonial standard of efficiency, so he must bear the name of new chum with equanimity, till the happy time arrives when he is capable of performing his various duties in true colonial fashion.
