Notes: Jim writes: DNZE tags this as <i>obs.</i>, but it remains current in this sense and with reference to an extended visit esp. from Britain or the US, e.g. "When did you come out?". "She's coming out this November". "<i>Come over</i>" is used in the same sense, but this is in NSOD. I have heard both expressions several times within the last year.

Quote: I had two cadets with me, and must explain that a cadet means a young fellow who has lately come out, and who wants to see a little of up-country life. He is neither paid, nor pays. He receives his food and lodging <i>gratis</i>, but works (or is supposed to work) in order to learn.
