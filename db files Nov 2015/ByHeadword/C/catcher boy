Quote: A Maori showed us where [the old flaxmill] was, and when we asked him if there were any signs he replied: `Te glory hole and te garden'. We found the old `glory hole' of the mill where once the catcher boy sat, covered with green pulp and flax gum as it dropped from the stripper rollers overhead.
