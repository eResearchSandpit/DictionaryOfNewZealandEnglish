Quote:  ... we found ourselves in Evans' Bay; and here, to our great surprise, we discovered wild oats and turnips growing luxuriantly. By whom the seed was first sown God only knows; but as the Maori designates the turnip Captain Cook's cabbage, I presume that great circumnavigator had something to do with it.
