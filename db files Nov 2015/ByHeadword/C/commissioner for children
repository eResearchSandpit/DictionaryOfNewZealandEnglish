Quote: Children's agencies in this country, such as the Commissioner for Children, Barnados and the Plunket Society, have stepped up their calls for bans on spanking and the repeal of s59. Children's Commissioner Roger McClay says that he was smacked with a belt, or a switch from a nectarine tree, as a child.
