Quote: The [bullock] whip was rawhide plaited sinnet, about six feet long, thick at the upper end, where it was fastened to a handle as long as itself, but tapering nearly to a point, to which was attached a narrow strip of rawhide, called `the fall,' finishing off with a twisted `cracker' made of `weetau' or dressed flax in [43] place of whipcord, and was a powerful flagellator in the hands of an experienced `bullock puncher.'
