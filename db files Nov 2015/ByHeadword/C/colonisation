Quote: It is impossible to reconcile the missionary system with that of the Company. ... The avowed object of the missionaries has been to prevent colonization, to preserve the nationality of the New Zealanders, ... and to maintain their exclusive property in the whole soil of the islands.Our system ... was ... to encourage the settlement of European colonists, and to turn to account the peculiar facilities which the aboriginal race of New Zealand seem to possess for intermixture and amalgamation with the European population.

Quote: Not so [jovial] Mr Govett, the vicar, who is innocent & naive enough to fear the corruption that these worthies may introduce into his cure. This fear of spoiling their `happy valleys' has been epidemic on the ministry here, and has made the missionaries oppose colonization and led them to vamp up all the nauseous maudlin maori fancying stuff that has caused disaster ... here...
