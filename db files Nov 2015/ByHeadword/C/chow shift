Quote: ] In the seeming open sewer that extends beyond the claim,/ Slinging stows out with his sluice-fork - ... / And the stones are ever coming,/ While the dirt-pipes keep a-drumming,/ You can hear the tail-race humming,/ ... `Night shift, day shift - ah, you'll now shift,/ For your chum will take the `chow' shift,'/ ... <i>Ibid.</i> 70 `Night shift, day shift - ah, you'll now shift,/ For your chum will take the `chow' shift,'/
