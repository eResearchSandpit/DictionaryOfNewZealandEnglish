Quote: <i>Chock</i> (ch&obreve.k), <i>n. [Add.] Chock and log</i>, a kind of fence. Rough split beams, from 2 to 3 feet long (called <i>chocks</i>) are laid at right angles to the line of the fence. On these are laid the <i>logs,</i> which are from 10 to 15 feet long, the ends of the logs often being fitted into slots cut in the chocks. The fence is built up to the required height in alternate layers of <i>chock</i> and <i>log. </i>
