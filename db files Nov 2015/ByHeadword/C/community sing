Notes: Jim writes: Hist? NSOD and Collins have entries for <i>community singing</i> - Collins "esp of hymns" and OED has 2 citations (1922 and 1923); at least one is US. No entry in DNZE or any other dictionary for commmunity sing. A feature of the Depression times was the <i>community sing</i> (eg at lunchtime once a week in the Wellington Town Hall) to raise money for relief of the unemployed. DEH adds that this tradition carried on in Dunedin Town Hall until at least 1954.

Quote: Supposing voluntary surrender of permitted hours were made, which, with the three-quarters of an hour in hand, would aggregate sufficient time for a broadcast of the community sing, could that be undertaken? the department was asked... These transgressions also had to be expiated by surrenders of equivalent future time before permission to broadcast the community sing was confirmed.
