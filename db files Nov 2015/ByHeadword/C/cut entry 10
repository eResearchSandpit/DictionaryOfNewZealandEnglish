Quote: Proceeding just fair, but with their regularity that follows a shearer getting his back used to the arduous job, the advancement went on but with a different and a rougher cut than was usual. More frequently application of the loppies galloping down the board, to the ever increasing cry of `Tar'. The cut was becoming rougher and numbers spoilt good work, and slowly the gore of the classer, the shepherds, and certainly that of William Steuart, rose.
