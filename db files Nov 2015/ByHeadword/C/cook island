Quote: The Government has been urged to redefine the term Pacific Islander so more people can qualify for scholarships. Melanesian and Micronesian students are excluded from some grants. ... [The Pacific Island Education Foundation] says grants can only go to pupils of Samoan, Cook Island, Niuean, Tongan or Tokelauan descent.
