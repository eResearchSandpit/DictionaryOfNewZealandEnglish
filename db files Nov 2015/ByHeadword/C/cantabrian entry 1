Quote: I can't help noticing that, on manyoccasions, the term "Cantabrian" is usedas the adjective for Canterbury. This isnot correct. The term "Cantabrian" is thaadjective for Cambridge... Presumably,the adjective for Canterbury is"Cantaburian" or "Canterburian".

Quote: SIR, Your news item of May 11, `Unashamedly Cantabrian' quotes the chairman of a Christchurch City Council committee saying some development project was `unashamedly parochial and unashamedly Cantabrian.' -->this adjective for `pertaining to Canterbury' rouses my curiosity. The word Canterbury itself is quite capable of being used as an adjective - Canterbury bells, Canterbury gallop (hence `canter') John Brooke-White? [The following in bold type.] The `Post's' chief reader Ian Spicer says `Cantabrian' to describe a resident of, or phenomenon related to Canterbury - and more particularly Christchurch - has been around for a long time. Usage appears to be peculiar to Christchurch newspapers and some individuals, perhaps as a means of reinforcing some quaint notions held by them about the city's Englishness. Arguments about the word have waxed at least as long with Canterburians being preferred by some as being etymologically more valid. However, Canterburians looks awkward and is a mouthful to pronounce: for those reasons, Cantabrian appears to have scored the victory.
