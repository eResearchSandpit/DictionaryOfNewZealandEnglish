Quote:  FLATHEAD <i>Katheostoma giganteum</i> Haast ... Other names for the Flathead are Chinaman and Frenchman, but where these names originated and for what reason I do not know with certainty. One theory is that when Chinamen hawked fish about Dunedin they kept Flatheads for their own consumption, as they preferred them to all other fish.

Quote:  [The Flathead, <i>Kathetostoma</i> sp.] Sometimes called Frenchman or Chinaman (presumably because these fishermen sold them in the early Otago days). The Latin translation of the name means roughly `large, perpendicular mouth.' Also known as Spotted Stargazer.... FRENCHMAN Another name for Flathead. Also known as Chinaman. The latter name apparently derives from the fact that Chinese fish merchants in Dunedin in the early days always kept these fish for their own consumption. Nowadays these fish are more accurately termed Spotted Stargazer
