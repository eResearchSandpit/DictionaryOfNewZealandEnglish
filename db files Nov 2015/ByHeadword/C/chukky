Quote: West Coast miners call these [bits of stone in coal] <i>chukkies</i>, another north-country term. A chukky in the north was (and is) a pebble, and the children's game of knuckle-bones was there called chukkies or chukky-stones, played not with sheep's bones but with pebbles. It was - like skipping-ropes - a purely female sport and no six-year-old male chauvinist would touch a <i>chukky</i> - unless he wanted to use it as a projectile.
