Quote: At Phil Moore's instigation, the Society has approached Carter Holt Holdings Ltd expressing concern at the effects of forest clear-felling on the Mangahounga Stream and the Te Hoe Valley, Wairoa County, and the possibility of silting and/or clogging up of the stream beds and burying of the vertebrate fossil-bearing materials being studied by Mrs Joan Wiffen (see Newsletter No. 63, p.29 - 32).
