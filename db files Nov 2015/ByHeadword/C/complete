Quote: We achieved a complete in the long pull. I put two dogs in that event and got a complete with one and about halfway down with the other, which gave me some points .. I didn't get a complete, but both my heading dogs' runs got points, and I felt rather good doing it, hobbling away on my crutches .. I got five completes in all, and found out a couple of days later that I'd won the local mustering cup for aggregated points.
