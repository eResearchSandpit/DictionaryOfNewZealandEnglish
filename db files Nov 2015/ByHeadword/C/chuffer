Quote: A bombardier then explained that a handful of propellant from a 105mm cartridge dropped into the orifice of a portable hot water boiler (commonly known as a chuffer) is guaranteed to produce brew water in less than thirty seconds. <i>Ibid.</i> 85 These clever cylindrical devices have a hollow core where the twigs or other fuel burns. Around the heating core is a vessel that contains the water. The hollow core forms a chimney with quite a strong draught and of course nearly all the heat acts on the walls of the vessel and it boils water very efficiently in just a few minutes.
