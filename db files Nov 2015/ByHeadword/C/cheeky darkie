Quote: The word "cheeky" quite obviously refers to the plump part of a person's face, and the word "darkie" in our dictionary alludes to people of profound intellectual depth... Cheeky, of course, is what his rounded face is; little is what his height is; and bugger, as we know, is a word coined by an advertising agency meaning "a serendipitous accident". It doesn't mean at all what is used to mean - and that's official.

Quote: No matter the outcome of Paul Holmes' plummeting ratings, his inflammatory comments will ensure his name will live forever, at least in film.  Bollywood producer Jitendra Pal is in pre-production of a film set in New Zealand tauntingly titled <i>The Cheekie Darkie</i>.  Jitendra's website explains the film as "When Hollywood dreamer Karen elopes with cute Indian scamster Varun to Bollywood, the Kiwi mob is left with no option but to turn up in Mumbai in hot pursuit."

Quote: King's star guest.. dropped in to vouch that, as her TV One colleague, Holmes had at all times been a great interview whenever she'd had him on her show;.. and to spontaneously tell King that she thought he was a cheeky darkie, thus making it okay for the brilliant female journalist to follow suit in using the controversial racist epithet.
