Quote: The Cambodian practice of "coining" - a health remedy that leaves frightening red marks on the skin - has drawn concern from health officials and teachers... The grandmother takes a coin and dips it into a jar of oil.  Swiftly and repetitively she rubs the edge of the coin along the girl's back...Coining (goh kyol in Cambodian) is said to release excess wind from the body. By correcting the imbalance, good health is restored.

Quote: In fact, coining - 0r goh kyol (rubbing the wind) - is relatively painless and afterward even pleasurable... Mrs Young also addresses student teacher and student nurse classes so they can recognise coining. In one class, a student nurse asked if it could help her headache and Mrs Young said she did coining on the young woman's neck.
