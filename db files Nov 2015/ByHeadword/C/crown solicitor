Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The office (and the term) has existed since the 1840s and has no close counterpart in England, where the prosecution system is organised in a different way. It corresponds to the Canadian term <i>Crown Attorney</i> (recorded in Collins). In relation to criminal cases Crown solicitors are also referred to as <i>Crown prosecutors</i> (as in Canada) but their function is wider. A brief reference to the history and functions of the office is in the Law Commission's paper on <i>Criminal Prosecution</i> (NZLC PP. 28, 1997)
