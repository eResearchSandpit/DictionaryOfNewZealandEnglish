Quote: Crown entities are not departments or ministries, like the Department of Internal Affairs or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Neither are they state-owned enterprises, like New Zealand Post. The term crown entity has been applied like a mop to most of the other bodies which the crown has set up over the years to carry out little bits of its business. There are about 160 of them... We've divided them into five categories... Crown agents... Independent, quasi-judicial bodies (e.g. the Police Complaints Authority or the Environmental Risk Management Authority)..Trusts (e.g. Road Safety Trust).. Companies (e.g. Radio New Zealand).. Other organisations (e.g. schools).
