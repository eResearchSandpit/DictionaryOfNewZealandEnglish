Quote: A game called Anchorman played by the students at one of the University of Otago's Halls of Residence, requires participants to consume six jugs of ale in four hours without being sick. The reward is an Anchorman's badge. ... Although it has been banned by college authorities ... [it is] regarded as a way of sorting out `Men' from the `chunder bunnies' or `coma kids'. To become an Anchorman is to be like an anchor which stands firm even when completely submerged
