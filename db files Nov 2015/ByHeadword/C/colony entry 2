Quote: Within the country, New Zealand was after 1840 known as <i>the Colony</i>, and subsequently as <i>the Dominion</i>, the title it carried from 1907 until the 1940s or somewhat later. Now it is simply <i>the country</i>, or more formally <i>the nation</i>, and of course <i>home</i> (as opposed to <i>Home</i>) for those Kiwis who are temporarily absent from it.

These five colonies were settled at different times, each upon a totally distinct plan of colonization, and by persons who proceeded direct to their respective colony, either from Great Britain or from the neighbouring Australian colonies, and who rarely passed through any other New Zealand settlement previously to reaching the colony which they now inhabit; and who ... rarely travel from their own colony to any neighbouring settlement.
