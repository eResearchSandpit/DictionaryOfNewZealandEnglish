Quote: When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

Quote: The `wool-shed' where all shearing is done has a row of pens (`catching-pens', they are called) in it reaching from one end to the other, each pen holding some 25 to 30 sheep. Opposite each of these are two shearers, who draw their sheep one by one out of their pens until the pen is exhausted.

Quote: Another job suitable for a new hand is `Sheep O!' The work consists of filling up the `catching pens' when empty. The shearer who takes the last sheep (called the `cobbler') calls out `Sheep O!' when the boy ... immediately fills up the back pen.

Quote: Two shearers usually have one pen to catch their sheep from. They are called catching pens. When the shearer has shorn the sheep, he lets it go into another pen, which is known as a counting-out pen, because it is in these pens that the overseer counts the number of sheep each shearer has shorn.

Quote: In addition to filling up the catching pens, [the sheep-o] weighed the bales and recorded them, with their descriptions in the wool book. <i>Ibid.</i> 129 When an old hand and a young one were sharing a catching pen, the former [130] would let the learner in for the `cobbler', or hard shearing sheep, at the end of every pen, and when the pen had been re-filled, quickly catch and shear all the `rosellas,' or easily shorn sheep, before the unfortunate novice had finished his cobbler.

Quote: The bell rang, the whole procedure stopped, shearers trooped out, half shorn sheep were pushed back into the catching pens. Jimmy Greave the classer hurriedly whispered to William Steuart to desist, but loppies, rousies, and even young Jim, who was assisting to pen up, followed out from the side door to where the shoots from the stands gave the nearest exit, to the level space of the outside turf, that made eventually the [boxing] ring.
