Quote:  ... a sort of little crane-flies (<i>tipula alis incumbentibus</i>), which had plagued us ever since our entrance into Dusky Bay, became remarkably troublesome during the bad weather. They were numerous in the [136] skirts of the woods, not half so large as gnats or musketoes, and our sailors called them sand-flies.
