Quote: Even if no other cattle were on the run, it behoved the station to keep a cow or two for milking purposes, and generally a lad was kept whose duties were to tend and milk the animals, and perhaps to assist in the garden. This lad was called the cowboy, and this was no abuse of the meaning of the term, whereas the American cowboy might have long grey whiskers and have never milked a cow in his life.
