Quote: Mauku is also the name of the cradling fern (<i>Asplenium bulbiferum</i>). There are other forms of the name - mouku and mouki; and as this well-developed fern is one of the common ferns of the bush, and being large-fronded and graceful is well-known, it would be useful as well to use one of the variant names, say mouki, to save confusion with mauku (a species of ti).
