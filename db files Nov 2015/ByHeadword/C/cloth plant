Quote: The third sort of Ahou [cloak] seemed to be made of the Cloth Plant coarse- ly beat out or of a kind of narrow Sedge or course [sic] grass- ... the ends of the stuff of about a foot long were left out so as to form a thick covering layer over layer, and very much resembled what Seamen call thrum-Matts.
