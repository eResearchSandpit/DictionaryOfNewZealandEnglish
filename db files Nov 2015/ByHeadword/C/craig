Quote: CRAIG includes representatives from WoolPro, Merino New Zealand, the shearing contractors association, wool brokers, exporters and merchants. CRAIG registrar, Struan Hulme, said the group was concerned about some lots that had been classed into categories as narrow as 0.1 microns, with little regard for other factors. CRAIG said with some bales weighing just 100 kg greasy (70 kg clean) or less, exporters find them difficult to sell.
