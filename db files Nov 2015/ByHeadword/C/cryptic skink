Quote: 'So for the extensive survey, we're using a basic method of counting how many lizards are captured in a 24-hour period. It's a quick index of population size for species such as common skinks and McCann's skinks and common (brown) geckos. Unfortunately we're unlikely to detect less abundant species such as green skinks, cryptic skinks or jewelled geckos.'
