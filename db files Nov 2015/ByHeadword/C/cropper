Quote: In New Zealand there are two classes of men that are rarely found connected with Agriculture in England, viz:- Contractors and croppers. ... The contractors undertake to do the ploughing, harrowing, sowing and other farm operations at a given price per acre ... The croppers are a class of men who pay a price per acre for the privilege of taking off a crop of corn after the land had been fed a couple of years in clover or grass. ... [6] [Origin of contractors and croppers is: `the great want of the Colony is and has been <i>men</i> not money'; and `the large holdings and the inability of the landowner to work all his land himself']
