Quote: Crossbred descriptions were mainly light conditioned, good average topmaking wools, though a proportion lacked full length and were affected by 'chiv' and light discoloration, thus restricting the supply of specialty types. Much of the offering was affected by vegetable fault, especially in respect to 'chiv' and moit. Good average topmaking pre-lamb shorn crossbreds predominated in the offering, which, because of seasonal faults of slight discoloration and 'chiv' included rather less good to super wools and specialty types than are usually on hand at this time.
