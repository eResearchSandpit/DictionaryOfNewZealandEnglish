Quote: In a rat-chewed diary ... kept by James Busby during the years 1828-38 ... are to be seen references to trade transactions in `Sydney Currency' ... Owing to a shortage of coins at Sydney and Hobart, traders resorted to the issue of promissory notes ... for amounts down to 3d., and these were termed `currency' as distinguished from `sterling', specie or Government money. This originated the term `Currency Lad' [82] (Colonial-born). <i>Ibid.</i> 148 <i>`Colonial Currency.'-</i> In addition to Government notes, known as `sterling currency,' traders and whalers issued currency notes, known as `colonial currency' which circulated throughout Australasia long after the Government notes had been called in [past 1826].
