Quote: The miners always carried their food (crib) to work in a specially designed tin box called a crib tin, together with an enamelled tea billy equipped with a drinking mug. The crib tin was necessary in the damp conditionsm because the mine was overrun with rats as big as bulldogs. The miners looked for a dry spot in a worked-out section of tunnel in which to leave their gear. This was known as the `crib cuddy'.
