Quote: The Auckland Green Gecko is found in the northern half of the North Island, north of Taranaki. The tail is very versatile, being used as a "fifth limb" to climb and for balance. It hunts by night for insects but also likes to sunbathe. The Auckland Green Gecko lives in scrub and forest areas, especially Kanuka and Manuka, also known as tea tree.
