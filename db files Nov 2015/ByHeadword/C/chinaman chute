Quote: <i>Chinaman chutes</i>: These were used for feeding the surface filling into two-and-a-half-ton trucks. They generally consisted of a few planks laid across the drift timbers under which the trucks were placed while the material was `rilled down' from the sloping face above and checked by dropping a plank into position.
