Quote: New Zealand's smallest native lizard, the copper skink (up to 62 mm,, excluding the tail), is widespread in the North Island. It is found in forests, open areas with ground cover, and on the seashore near the high-tide mark. It has taken to life in the suburbs, making itself particularly at home in rock gardens and compost heaps.

Quote: The Cyclodina group of lizards contains more rare species than any other group of New Zealand lizard. The group is also notable for containing the smallest indigenous skink - the copper skink (120mm) - and the largest - the 'presumed extinct' Northland skink (350mm).

Quote: The Copper Skink is very common over much of the North Island.  Sleek, glossy and coppery in colour, it grows to about 10 cms, with a very long tail.  Being nocturnal they are active mainly by night and eat small insects, spiders and similar invertebrates.The Copper Skink does not lay eggs but is a live-bearer.  Usually 3 - 7 in number, the young are born in February - March and are often large at birth, sometimes up to half the adult length.
