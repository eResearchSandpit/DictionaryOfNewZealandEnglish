Quote: Perhaps the most recurrent and universal of rough games in the early period was <i>Cockfighting</i> (K-78). This was a free-for-all contest in which a smaller boy mounted on the back of a bigger boy and the two endeavored [sic] to dislodge all other riders by pushing or [202] pulling them over. ... Sometimes the game was known as a Piggy-back Contest or as Pulling Off. `One trick of the game was to `buck-jump' your rider, which consisted in jerking your elbows so that the rider was lifted over your head' (Naseby, Otago, 1905).

Quote: We had our games [c1907]. A favourite was `Monkey', where the contestant climbed one of the fir trees along one side of the ground (still there at the present day) and did a grand traverse of as many trees as possible. It was characterized by noise, boasting, cheating and an occasional sprained wrist. There was cockfighting in which each of two players, mounted pick-a-back, tried to resist dislodgement.
