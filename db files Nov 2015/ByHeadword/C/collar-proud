Quote: Denis Wederell.. has dug up an unusual term to describe the feeling a lot of people have.. when driven by lack of money to return to paid employment... Denis, confronted with collar-proud to describe this uncomfortable feeling, says he can't find it in his reference books... A fellow with a farming background... said it's a term for the chafing on a draughthorse's neck when it is put in a collar after a long spell off work.
