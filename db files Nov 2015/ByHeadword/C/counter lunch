Quote: He broke off [drinking] to say: `Johnnie, are you off counter lunches? It's a bit late, but I'm half starved. Couldn't you turn on a counter supper for once?' <i>Ibid.</i> 257 All the hotels had dropped their counter lunches [at the start of the Depression], but tha hit custom so heavily that they had to resurrect a ghost of the old hearty piles; that was only between noon and two o'clock, and you had to nip in quickly, or the sere sandwiches and stale pickles had been whisked out of sight. Cheese was a thing of the past.

Something to fill up on ... or to toss on the bar as counter-lunch. Come to think of it, counter-lunch is <i>le mot juste</i>, stifling as it does all desire for other food.
