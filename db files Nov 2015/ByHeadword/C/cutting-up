Quote: The `cutting-up' of a whale, <i>secundum artem</i>, is a process which requires great proficiency, like that of the skilful dissector, who separates the cutis, and with it at once all fat and cellular tissue, from the subjacent muscles. In the whale the blubber is to be regarded as the cutis, in the cellular structure of which the oily matter has been deposited. Shortly after the death of the fish the epidermis comes off in large pieces, looking like oiled and dried satin.
