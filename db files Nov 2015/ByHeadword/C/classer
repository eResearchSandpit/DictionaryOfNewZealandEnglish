Quote: The classer has the key position in the shed and I always feel that in New Zealand his importance has often been underrated. He has full authority over the shed hands and is in complete control of the wool. In addition he can, if he has the right personality, have a very big influence over the shearers, and contribute very much towards the peaceful efficiency of the whole shearing. Besides these qualities of leadership and authority he is expected to be highly skilled in the classing and preparation of wool for sale. <i>Ibid.</i> 28 The classer stands beside the gong ... and when the clang of the old isc blade rings through the shed, the catching pen doors are flung open ...

Quote: A steam whistle ... blew for the commencement and finish of each run. The wool tables for rolling and skirting were in the centre of the woolboard. Close by stood the classer's table, where he sat and classed each fleece before it was carried by a shed hand to its respective bin. <i>Ibid.</i> 136 The classer urged me to pull out and not be such a fool.
