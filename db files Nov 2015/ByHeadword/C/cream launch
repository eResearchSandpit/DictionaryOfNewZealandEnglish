Quote: When the men came home from World War I, they were given the rehabilitation blocks. For an instant cash crop, all they had to do was burn the scrub, clear the land and introduce the dairy cow. Hence the cream launch .. though this boat was the cream-launch, she officially began running the river in 1913, taking the mail up. [cream-launch]
