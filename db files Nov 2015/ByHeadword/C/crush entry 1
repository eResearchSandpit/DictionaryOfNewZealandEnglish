Quote: Big Mick the Speewah ringer, must make skin and trimmings fly/ This season if he means to keep ahead;/ For Barcoo Ben will run him and half a dozen more/ Of the lank Australian crush upon the board,/ And it ain't no use to tell us of the tallies that he shore,/ There'll be records broke this year, you take my word.
