Quote: PLAGIANTHUS LYALLII (<i>Hook., F</i>.) ... `THE HOHERE'. - This very handsome tree is found in the mountainous districts of the Middle Island. ... Owing to the flowering habit of the tree, and its fruit being a depressed sphere, hanging on a long ... stalk, it is commonly known by the settlers as the `Wild Cherry'.
