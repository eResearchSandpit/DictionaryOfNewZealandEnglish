Quote: We still don't know how firm the legal difference is between "customary title" and "customary use", and the government daren't let a court ever rule on this.

Quote: The most pervasive customary right was customary title, which, though unique, almost equated to ownership. It was territorial and the hapu could not have existed without the full use of the land in question. To prove a customary title, a hapu had to show it was in exclusive occupation of the land prior to sovereignty passing and that it had continued to follow customary activities on it ever since.

Quote: What is customary title? Much like an ordinary title to land, customary title confers rights to the holder. These could include the right to use the land for farming or living on. However, customary title arises where the Maori holds land in accordance with tikanga Maori or Maori custom. It is held communally (as opposed to owned) and cannot be alienated (sold or mortgaged) to anyone but the crown.
