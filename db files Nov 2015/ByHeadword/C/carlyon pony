Quote: Cream with a black mane, the breed was evolved through Major Carlyon crossing imported Exmoor sires with local horses. They became widely known as the Carlyon ponies and are held in high repute. Later in my travels I saw a Carlyon stallion at Ahinewairua Station in the Inland Patea: it was a beautiful pony. These Carlyon horses are cream with a black mane and tail ... he has a batch of yearlings by the Carlyon horse out of draught mares ... [Carlyon horse]
