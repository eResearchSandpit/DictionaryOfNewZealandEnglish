Quote: The phrase "cinema of unease" was a too-neat title to sum up an increasingly diverse film practice - it locked the New Zealand tradition into a permanent early-80s of Bruno Lawrence road movies and male self-loathing, with the forces of law and order always closing in (okay, the ultimate "unease" film is therefore <i>Smash Palace</i>).
