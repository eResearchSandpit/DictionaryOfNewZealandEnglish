Quote: Montana would, in the 1960s, expand its operations to a 120-hectare vineyard at Mangatangi in the northern Waikato and would soon launch onto the market a concoction which even today lives on in the national memory of a generation - Cold Duck, along with Montana Pearl, was made from siebel bybrid grapes with a touch of sherry material thrown in. Drunk like cordial at student balls, these two - and another Montana line, an orange-flavoured concoction called Poulet Poulet - possibly led to more acts of sexual intercourse than any other contributing factor in the New Zealand of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Quote: [Montana's] recent release  of the most notorious proto-alcopop, Cold Duck, refreshed memories of an old marketing wheeze. <i>Ibid.</i> 51 The only thing more intriguing than Montana's recent exposure of its dirty duck linen was the media orgy that it provoked, with a raft of bizarre 70s nostalgia riding on the Cold Duck wave... Cold Duck was certainly the most popular of the booze labels that served those grim days when getting legless was the sole purpose of a night out.
