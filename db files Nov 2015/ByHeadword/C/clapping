Quote: Clapping is considered a fault in heading dogs [38] by most trainers in New Zealand. The term describes the habit of some heading dogs particularly those with a strong eye, of lying down every time they stop moving. ... If you decide clapping is a fault you wish to correct, the time to do it is when the dog ... `claps' for the first time.
