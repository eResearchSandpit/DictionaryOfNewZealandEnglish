Quote: GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS: A boobhead is a prisoner; a screw is a warder; a topper is a toady or an informer. The Act or the Collar - The Habitual Criminals Act, under which persons declared habitual criminals can have their sentences increased by the Prisons Board for offences against prison discipline during their incarceration.... That's Joe, they said, doing six years and the Act for shooting a copper. He was the last man in New Zealand to stop a flogging. ... [15] Joe was doing six years and the Collar, which meant he didn't know when he'd get out.
