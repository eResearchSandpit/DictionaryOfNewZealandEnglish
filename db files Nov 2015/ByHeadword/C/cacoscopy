Quote: There seems to be a law that requires movie cameras to be waved about all over the place. No shot lasts more than half a second. Slow motion, jerky slow motion, tortuous graphics. It's visual cacophony, and could well be called cacoscopy, though I can't find that word in the dictionary. Yet.
