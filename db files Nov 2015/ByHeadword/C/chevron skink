Quote: Neilson has already told me how rare it is to see chevron skinks in the wild... So few chevron skinks have been reported that there is no way of estimating the size of their populations... [74] Chevron skinks at Auckland Zoo have been observed to jump up onto the mesh covering of their cage and hang upside down by their feet, which also suggests they would be at home in the forest canopy.
