Quote: All this car-less day nonsense is ludicrous. If the government is really serious about saving 10 per cent of petrol consumption they should simply shoot every tenth motorist.

Quote: <i>carless days</i>: On the 30th July 1979, New Zealand introduced a drastic fuel conservation measure ... This was the banning of the operation of all privately and petrol powered motor vehicles weighing 4,400 lbs or less (except for motor-cycles) for one day per week. That day to be chosen by the owner of the vehicle in question. ... You will see a green sticker with a white X upon it next to the red carless day sticker on the windscreens of exempt vehicles.

Quote: My carless day was Thursday. With oil prices dropping through the sump I can probably scrape the sticker off my windscreen now. Remember carless days, exemption stickers, weekend petrol sales bans, plans for petrol rationing, the Iranians cutting their oil production to a quarter, the somber pleas of the Government to `go easy on energy', the threat of petrol prices going through the garage roof?

Quote: This contributed to a significant drop in the road toll, as did 'carless days' and the halting of weekend petrol sales in 1979.
