Notes: R. Gilberd (milling Okaihau, Northland) The old method of tightening the chain securing logs to trucks is called `twitching' or `taking a twitch.' First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is passed through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch.' `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `pitch.'
