Quote: Perhaps, also, he will help to remind them how good, how strenuous life was `in the good old days,' when their Dominion was still half-savage, still unsettled after the toughest of colonial wars, and before the fire and axe of succeeding generations of peaceful settlers had robbed her of so much of her incomparable possession, the native bush.
