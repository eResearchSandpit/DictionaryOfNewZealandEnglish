Quote: One of the by-products ot the Australian wine industry's recent bout of economic heaving has been the swelling presence of "cleanskins". Cleanskins are bottled wines that bear no branded information.... Cleanskins typically become cleanskins because there is no other market for the wine... On a recent visit to Melbourne, I kept running into recently opened specialist cleanskin retail outlets.
