Quote: When Dad was chopping in the bush and not too far away, Pud and I would often take his crib out to him. This would usually consist of hot scones, hot pie and bread. The food would be placed on a tin plate, then carried in a tea towel tied together at the four corners to form a convenient grip or handle.
