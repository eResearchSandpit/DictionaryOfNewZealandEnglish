Quote: <i>Challenge feeder:</i> An inclined cast-iron disc about two feet in diameter mounted in the chute leading from the stamp hopper to the stamp mortar-box; it rotated slowly in short jerks, actuated by a striking mechanism attached to the camshaft, thus spilling the ore lying on it into the mortar-box at regular intervals and providing a remarkably constant feed.
