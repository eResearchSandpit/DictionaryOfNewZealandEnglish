Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. ... There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies ... and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.
