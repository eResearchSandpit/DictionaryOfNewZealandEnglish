Quote: DODDER (<i>Cuscuta epithymum</i>), or clover dodder, is one of the best known parasites among the following plants, and soon sends up a thin thread-like twining stem. Unless this stem finds a suitable host plant, e.g.; red clover, it dies, but if such a plant is present the stem twines round it, and sends little suckers through its skin, and commences to draw nutriment from it.
