Quote: 4 In these and many other ways the efforts of the Government have been successfully directed to the improvement and civilization of the Maori race. -->1862 Aug 23 Otago Witness 2 [of the natives] He [Mr. Fitzgerald, MP for Ellesmere] then reviewed the present condition of the Maori; it was a state of decay. The civilization that had been going on had been checked, owing in a great degree to the late war. ... The Natives were, however, in a state of retreat from civilization before the wa[r]s, from various causes, such as the loss of power by the old chiefs - a loss that allowed the Natives to fall into a state of political anarchy, because no institutions had been given them in its place. Another cause of decay was, that they had lost the arts of their old life before they had acquired the arts of civilization.
