Quote: Most of the drafting was done in the open by a process known as cutting out. Several men would hold the cattle together in a bend of a boggy creek or a corner of a paddock while the [136] `cutter-out' rode through them, and after spotting the beast that he wanted, would follow it out to the edge of the mob, when the holder would open out and allow both beast and cutter-out to pass through... A second's false timing, and the cutter-out's manoeuvre was ruined. I have had some nice things said about my ancestors by the cutter-out when things do not eventuate as they should have done.
