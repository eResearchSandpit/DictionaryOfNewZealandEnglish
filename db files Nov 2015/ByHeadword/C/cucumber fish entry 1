Quote: SMELT A common little fish often confused with - and caught with - whitebait. He is the bitter, silver fellow the sharp-eyed whitebaiter discards from his nets. Smells like cucumber, hence one of his other names Cucumber-fish. Also called Silvery. ... Several types of smelt occur around New Zealand - Canterbury, Chatham Islands, Rotorua, Sea Foam, Southland and Stokell's - but it takes a real expert to tell them apart.
