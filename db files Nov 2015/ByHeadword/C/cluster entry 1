Quote: "Should at any time there be insufficient priests available for appointment as pastors of all parishes, groups of two or more neighbouring parishes are to be formed into clusters, with one or more priests appointed to serve the cluster, and with pastoral leadership in those parishes without a resident priest being entrusted to a lay man or woman."... Cardinal Williams presented some ideas as to how we might cluster parishes... From all the discussions that day it seemed those present were in favour of clustering soon and of clustering the Archdiocese as a whole.
