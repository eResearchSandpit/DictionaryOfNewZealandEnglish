Quote:  [sc. of land] When the selection [of the N.Z. Company share of the Otago Block] had been made the Crown grant was to be issued, and there was an understanding that if Colonel Wakefield desired still more land he was to have it. This was the origin of what was afterwards known as the depasturage licences, under which settlers were authorised to run cattle and sheep in the adjoining districts.
