Quote: Consumers wanted the standards to be extremely high, but some producers, "especially cowboys" wanted them as low as possible so they "get on board really quickly and make a quick buck." Support for producers converting to organics was requested by many submitters, Mr Ewen-Street said. A simple answer would be a subsidy, but apart from being "a dirty word in New Zealand" there would be no comeback if a "cowboy" did not deliver on his promises.
