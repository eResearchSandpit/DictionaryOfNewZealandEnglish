Quote: New Zealanders are just as sloppy about their use of the term `college'. Here, a high school may find itself honored with the title of `college'. In America, `college' means only one thing - an institute of higher learning above the high school - the New Zealand `university college'. For this reason confusion often crops up - when someone from Arizona reports the very true fact that [50] `five years of college education are necessary before one can become a high school teacher', he means five years of university work - through the M.A. degree. The New Zealander usually thinks he means one year beyond high school, and therefore thinks of American educational standards as being lower than they are.

Quote: College: This is not a term that (with one and a half exceptions) refers to University level institutions, nor does it (as in some British and North American institutions) refer to the component parts of a University. These parts are called Faculties, e.g. the Faculties of Medicine and Law. Most colleges are HIGH SCHOOLS and this is the general term for a high school. The institutions that train teachers are also called Teachers' College.
