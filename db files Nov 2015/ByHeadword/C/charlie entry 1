Quote: Police have seen up to 50 people betting on a single game of `Charlie' in Wellington hotel bars, and are mounting a campaign to halt the gambling. The sudden popularity was inexplicable, but involved large numbers of punters of all ages. Eighty percent of public bars hosted the game from time to time, he thought. `Charlie' is played with three cards. The conductor turns over the middle card and the players bet on whether the other cards will be of a higher or lower value, depending on the value of the middle card.
