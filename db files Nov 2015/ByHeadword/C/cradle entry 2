Quote: If oats or other grain was to be mown, the grass nail was removed and a strong flexible withe of wood was substituted. This was called a cradle and had the effect of leaving behind a skilled mower small sheaves which reduced the gathering and binding of the crop, though this latter job was usually performed by the men.
Notes: [Wellington c1880s]
