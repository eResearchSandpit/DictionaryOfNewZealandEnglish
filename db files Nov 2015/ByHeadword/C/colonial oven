Quote: Our kitchen had a colonial oven embedded in stones cracked flat and plastered with clay. A tunnel was placed at the back on the right and left corner also in clay. The stones and clay were filled in about 6 ft up and the hobs each side on the top of the oven were raised about four inches. At the left side, a crane or arm was erected, and swung in and out. On it were chains and hooks and from it hung our pots, kettles and boilers.

Quote: <i>Colonial oven</i>: A plain oven without divisions, trays or dampers, like a box with the door at one side. It is set a little above the floor of the fireplace so that a fire can be put under it for baking, but most of the cooking is done on an open fire lighted on top if it. (C.)
