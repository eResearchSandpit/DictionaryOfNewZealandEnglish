Quote: The bush costume of the [Artillery] officers in New Zealand [c.1846] consists of a blue serge shirt, coarse trowsers, hobnail boots, and a cabbage-leaf hat or cap; as like the dress of the street orderlies as anything can be. It is a pity that those who identify a soldier with his red coat, gold lace, feathers and trappings, cannot see the reverse of the picture.
