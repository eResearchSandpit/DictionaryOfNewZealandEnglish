Quote: One of the terms.. is one restricted to the New Zealand subantarctic: Cape Expeditioner. During World War II, the New Zealand government sent small numbers of men to Campbell Island and the Auckland Islands as coast-watchers. In order to minimise chances of this action being detected by the enemy, the code name 'Cape Expedition' was given to the project.
