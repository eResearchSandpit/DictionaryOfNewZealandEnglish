Quote: To calm the nervy, a decoy would be tied up on the Bog Roy side, and a shepherd called 'the catcher' would run up, slip a lead over her and pull her across, or step over her, lick her bum and go maa-maa. other shepherds on the shingle riverbanks below poked their 'crooks' through the slats, but over water the catcher was on his own. Ian was tops at it. But Ian was off chasing a racehorse one hot muster, and Dunc was catcher.
