Notes: Jim Cameron writes: Many dictionary definitions of crime/offence are loose, overlapping and sometimes circular, reflecting general usage. But in NZ they also have a precise legal meaning... The definition of a crime is thus procedural, although approximately a crime = a serious offence. See Crimes Act 1961 s2 - the definitions date from the Criminal Code Act 1893.
