Quote: The Waikaka [heading] When the dredging commenced in 1897 more and more people began to settle round Waikaka village and the land on the hill on the east side of the township became a common land where anyone grazed cows and hacks. Finally a large area ... was declared a commonage ... Between 1900 and 1914 this Commonage was cut up into farmlets varying from thirty to fifty acres.
