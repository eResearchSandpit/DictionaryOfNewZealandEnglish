Quote: It may be well to remark that the man who holds the lambs for the operation is called a 'catch.' The 'catch' then takes a lamb, passes his hands between its forelegs, seizes its hindlegs below the hock and places it sitting on the docking-board..the 'catch' should hold the lamb in such a way that its head rests against his breast. The 'catch' should be careful so to release the lamb that he falls on all fours.
