Quote: Terrible pity to see good cow-tucker going to waste like that, you know. <i>Ibid.</i> 156 `Won't you have them [sc. cows] running short of feed?' `Well ... Nobody's got cow-tucker to burn. I started feeding out before the end of April.' `How are you off for hay, then?' `Just about cut out, what the hell do you think?'
