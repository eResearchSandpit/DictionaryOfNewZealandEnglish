Quote: (1) Castrate. <i>Cutting and tailing</i> was the old term for earmarking, castrating and taking the tails off lambs, all of which operations are performed together. <i>Cutting and tailing</i> is still the general name mostly used by shepherds, but owing to more ladies living up country, I suppose [(probably because more women now live up country], is being replaced by <i>tailing</i> or <i>marking. </i>
