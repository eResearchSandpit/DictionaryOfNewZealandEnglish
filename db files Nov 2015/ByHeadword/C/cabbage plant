Quote: ... in many places the undergrowth consisted of young tree [84]ferns and cabbage plants. many of the ferns attain a great height but the palms more rarely, probably for their being cut down at a certain age for the sake of the heart of the young stem which is very good to eat either raw or cooked, being something between the heart of a cabbage and a cocoanut.
Notes: (H.R. Richmond)
