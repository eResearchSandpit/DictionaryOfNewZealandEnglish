Notes: Jim writes: An informant confirms that the term is well-known to Tararua trampers, especially in the form <i>clagged in</i>, meaning that cloud or mist blocks out the surroundings and inhibits or prevents travelling. <i>Clag in</i> is also known and used in Otago, to refer for instance to fog coming over the tops.
