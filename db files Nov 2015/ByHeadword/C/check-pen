Quote: In larger sets of yards one or more of these drafting pens communicate, via a gate, with <i>the check pen(s)</i>: These vary in number corresponding with the number of drafting pens. Since their purpose is to hold sheep while they are being checked over for mistakes in drafting and for treatment, these pens must be small.
