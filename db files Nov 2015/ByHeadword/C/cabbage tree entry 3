There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: The name `cabbage-tree' was given by Captain Cook's people. ... Journal, 10th October, 1774 : `These cabbage-trees or palms were not thicker than a man's leg, and from ten to twenty feet high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree ; like it they have very large pinnated leaves, and are the same sort as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South Wales [vide Hawkesworth Voyages Vol 3]. The cabbage is, properly speaking, the bud of the tree ; each tree producing but one cabbage which is at the crown, where the leaves spring out, and is enclosed in the stem ... -->[Cook, Voyage to Pacific Ocean 1777 Vol II pp 148-9] ... The remarks that the leaves are pinnate, that each tree produces but one cabbage, and that the cutting of it destroys the tree, lead one to suspect that the tree referred to is not a Cordyline. The entry in the Journal was made at Norfolk Island, not New Zealand, but there is no indication in Cook as to what tree is referred to. ... A more definite clue in Banks (Journal of the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Banks during Captain Cook's First Voyage ... 1768-77, London, 1896 p227), where he writes of New zealand [sic] plants ... A footnote identifies the [`cabbage-tree'] as Areca Sapida Soland. ... [Nikau] ... `very closely related to the Norfolk Island A. Baueri which is a larger plant' [Hooker]. [Banks] says nothing of the eating of the young shoots of the Cordyline. It would appear, then, that primarily the term `cabbage-tree', `cabbage-palm' was applied to Areca Baueri, but has become transferred exclusively to Cordyline ... [examples and references to Cordyline and Areca in Colenso and others] ...

Quote: One would suppose that Kirk had forgotten the origin of the name when he says, `Settlers and bushmen generally apply the unmeaning [sic] name of "cabbage-tree"' (Kirk, Forest Flora of NZ p295). Cheeseman, too, says, `Universally known to New Zealand residents by the inappropriate name of "cabbage-tree"' (Cheeseman, Manual NZ Flora p707). Thomas explains the name and errs in doing so : `It receives its name from the arrangement of its leaves in tufts or heads at the ends of the branches' (Clark A Southern Cross Fairy-tale p53). Butler remarks `The cabbage-tree or ti-palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.' The settlers and bushmen followed Cook in using the young heart as a vegetable, and in their naming of the tree ; and when the reason for the name is known its inapproriateness disappears. To one section of the public it will always be the cabbage-tree ; to the other section, let it be lily-palm. `Ti-tree' and ti-palm' should certainly be banned, because of the hopeless confusion with tea-tree. The Canterbury form ti (-tree, -palm) is obs. Originally from Maori name for the tree, `ti', it was confused with tea-tree (`Manuka', Leptospermum sp) see Acland.

It was a most inconvenient name, causing confusion with <i>tea tree</i> (Manuka), one of the commonest Canterbury scrub bushes.
