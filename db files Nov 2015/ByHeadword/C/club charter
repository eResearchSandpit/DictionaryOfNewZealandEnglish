Notes: Jim writes: Largely historical (1881-1989). Such clubs were known as <i>chartered clubs</i>. A special NZ application of <i>charter</i>, in that the charter did not constitute the club or give it a higher status but was no more and no less than a liquor licence. Now replaced by the <i>club licence</i> except for some old chartered clubs. Collins notes chartered club in this sense as <i>NZ</i>.
