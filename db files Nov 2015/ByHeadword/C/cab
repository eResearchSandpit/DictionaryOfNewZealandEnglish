Quote: ... there was a great deal of shame [during the Depression] in the minds of working men ... who had to go with an order from the Charitable Aid Board for groceries up to the local Self Help. If I remember rightly, my parents used to spell out C.A.B. so that I wouldn't know what it meant ... I knew that we were going with a C.A.B. chit to get groceries ...
