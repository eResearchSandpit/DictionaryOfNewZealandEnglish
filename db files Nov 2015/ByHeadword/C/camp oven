Quote: As for culinary arrangements [in camp], there is the indispensable `billy' for tea, and for boiling water generally; a kerosene-tin for carrying and storing water, etc.; and a camp-oven, which is the general cooker. It is an iron pot about fifteen inches diameter, six inches deep, with straightly sloping sides, the top being about an inch or so wider than the bottom. The lid is slightly concave on the lower side, and has a looped handle on top at the centre. The whole is either slung over the fire by means of a big, looped handle, the ends of which are loosely affixed to loops on the outer sides of the oven or stood over coals.

Quote: It took a bit of a search to find camp ovens for sale, but I finally landed this one at Doyles for $29.95... Camp ovens are made of cast-iron so need to be protected from rust... My next project is to improve on the camp oven baking that I've tried so far... My sister's family are also old hands at camp oven cooking on summer holidays,though their oven has gathered dust for a few years now.

Quote: Although a camp oven can also be used as a pot, it special character comes from using it as a small oven, with the top heat provided by embers lifted onto the lid... [Dorothy Leonard] writes that cooking in a camp oven nestled into hot embers with more piled on top is "like cooking in an old coal range without a gauge. Your hand tells you the temperature."

Quote: On the ground in front of the fire would be the great camp ovens; these were twenty-four inches wide and eight or nine inches deep, standing on short legs. Coals of fire were shovelled under the camp oven or poured on top to give the necessary heat. And that's where the cook did his baking.
