Quote: [In working down a big cutting] - a small drive put into the hill. Into this rails were laid for trucks to run on. A hole was then made overhead, into which soil and debris was allowed to slide. The trucks when full were drawn by horses, which, after starting, were quickly unhooked. Once going, the truck gathers momentum and automatically tips itself. It is then returned again and again by the horses and again and again tipped in a like manner, until the work is completed. This device is called `the Chinaman', because it was a Chinaman who is credited with being first to introduce it into New Zealand. 1921 <i>Ibid </i>107 ... by means of `the Chinaman' they were able to load trucks underneath.
