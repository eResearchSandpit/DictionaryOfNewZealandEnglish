Quote: We found one of Cook's Medals amongst a heap of rubbish on Iron Island; it was a composite piece, of the size of a penny, on one side, was the head of George the Third, and the other was a representation of 2 ships & `Resolution and Adventure; sailed from England March 1772'. This I foolishly gave away for a trifle, (which I am sorry for as several of my friends would have liked to have had it). [fn] The idea for these brass medals to commemorate the voyage of the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i> came from Joseph Banks. Measuring 42mm in diameter they were struck by Matthew Boulton for the Admiralty (39, vol 2, p. xxix) and distributed to native people during the voyage (Plates 109 and 110). Cook left some of these medals in a Maori canoe on the beach at Cascade Cove in Dusky Bay in March 1773 (39, vol 2, p.113). The medal found by Boultbee fifty-three years later is the only one known to have been found in Dusky Bay (Plate 113).

Quote: <i>Cook Medals</i>. ... The first medallic link between Great Britain and New Zealand was ... forged by Captain James Cook who arranged (in 1772), with [210] the approval of the Lords of the Admiralty, to strike silver, copper and brass medals bearing, on the obverse, a portrait of King George III, and on the reverse a representation of two sailing ships - <i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Adventure</i> - with which Cook was to undertake his second voyage of discovery.
