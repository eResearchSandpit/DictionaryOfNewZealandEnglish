Quote: Carbonettes (North Island): hard packed BRIQUETS of COKE. Long and hot burning. The biggest bit of culture shock I've experienced in New Zealand was moving from the North Island, where these are sold in every neighborhood store (dairy) and gas (petrol) station, to the South Island and trying to buy some. No one knew what I was talking about.
