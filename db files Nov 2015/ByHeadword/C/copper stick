Notes: Ian Douglas (51 Liverpool St, Wanganui; dougie@xtra.co.nz) says the term used in England 60 years ago was "poss stick" a long wooden stick.  "There was also a 'posser' which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt." John Mihaljevic (jmjm@ihug.co.nz) writes that a BBC World Service My Century documentary (The Invention that Feed Women) broadcast by Radio NZ has a woman born in the East End of London in 1927 describing washdays (presumably the 1930s) and referring to her mother's use of copper sticks. "This was not just any piece of wood, but a specific tool; she described it as a 'one-handled rolling pin'" Alan Burnett (aged 75) writes (2/10/1999) that when he was a child in Scotland "we always spoke of the copper-stick or SPURKLE which was made by cutting a broom-handle in half! and used for poking the boiling clothes.
