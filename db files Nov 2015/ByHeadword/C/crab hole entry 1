Quote: We went down a spur for two miles that was very soft from the late rain, and full of waterholes, called crab-holes. These holes were formed by the large snowgrass tussocks being burnt out roots and all, leaving a hole, or by the uprooting of trees, where the hole was very large ... In some places these holes made by(?) cattle mustering a most hazardous undertaking. In Mr Alex Garvie's report in 1858 he refers to `podge holes,' presumably a variety of `crab-holes.'

Quote:  Mabel and I walked the swamp and lit fires. We both fell into crab-holes a name given to swampy country when full of holes and full of water in wet weather but dry now. These holes are hip deep to me and the poor little wife nearly went out of sight but she stuck to it.
