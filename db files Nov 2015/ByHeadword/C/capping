Quote: Only on one occasion in my high schooldays did my rage manifest itself. And that was very early in my first year, over the business of `capping'. Whatever capping meant (or means) elsewhere, in Greymouth it meant the ceremony by which new boys were initiated into the ways of high school by means of being belted on the rump with the rolled-up caps of older boys, peak outwards. For most Runanga boys this meant being thumped raw all the way to Greymouth on the train, and then being pushed through a tunnel of about 150 boys on the school ground and belted once again.
