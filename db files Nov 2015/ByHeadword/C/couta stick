Quote: BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit.

Quote:  [<i>Ibid</i> 311] Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. [<i>I bid.</i>314] The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw).
