Quote: Since the eighteen-eighties the electoral system had included a `country quota' which, by adding a fictitious twenty-eight per cent to the rural population when electoral boundaries were determined, gave the countryside that much extra political representation.

Quote: COUNTRY QUOTA was a percentage once added to the population of rural electorates to give them what was seen as a fairer balance with urban electorates in general elections. The country quota was first granted in 1881 and was equivalent to one-third of the population added to the actual population of rural constituencies. This was reduced to 18 per cent in 1887 and then increased to 28 per cent in 1889, the figure at which it remained until the country quota was abolished by the Labour Government in 1945.

Quote: The electoral device known as the 'country quota' was first used in New Zealand in 1881 when a 'quota' equivalent to 33 1/3 per cent of the population was added to rural constituencies. In 1887 this was reduced to 18 per cent, but was increased in 1889 to 28 per cent. It remained at this figure until 1945 when it was abolished by the Labour Government. Between 1881 and 1945 the `country quota' was added to the population of rural electorates which, for the purposes of the Electoral Act, meant population other than that contained in a city or borough of over 2,000 inhabitants, or in any area within 5 miles of the chief post offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Dunedin.
