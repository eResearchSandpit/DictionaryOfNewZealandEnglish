Quote: "Prime Canterbury" was mostly the result of Southdown or Border mated to half-bred Merinos... Even with this and other complaints, sheep throve, and put `Canterbury lamb' on the map, despite the fact ... that more lamb, so papered, illuminated, and appreciated by the British public, was often bred in the North Island. Later on New Zealand instituted a rather wonderful system of grading, from about 1882, when frozen lamb weighed 50lbs.
