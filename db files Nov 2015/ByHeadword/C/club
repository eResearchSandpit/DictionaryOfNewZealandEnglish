Quote:  ... we heard a loud hallooing on ... an island, which on this occasion obtained the name of Indian Island; and standing on the shore we perceived one of the natives ... He stood with a club or battle-axe in his hand, ... and behind him ... two women, each of them having a long spear. ... held a long speech ... swing round his club, on which he leaned at other times.

Quote: [sc. a Moriori club] But both their Spears and Clubs were subject to great variety. Some of the Spears were very long and pointed only at one end, without much neatness. Their Clubs were rough pieces of Wood, ... and a very few had two stones lashed on at one end, which gave them the appearance of a double-headed maul.
