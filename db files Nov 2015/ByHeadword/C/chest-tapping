Quote: The disciplinary body for phsyiotherapists is anticipating that members will have to find tens of thousands of dollars because of complaints about the chest-tapping of babies at National Women's Hospital... Thirteen sick, premature babies who received chest-tapping treatment between 1992 and 1994 suffered a rare form of brain damage... The tapping, with a soft latex mask, was used to help remove chest secretions.
