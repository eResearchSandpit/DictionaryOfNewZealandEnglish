Quote: The new Charter era for TVNZ is almost upon us... Others might argue that it will take supernatural powers to make the new Charter work... But there are also dangers in the new set-up - mainly that TYVNZ swaps the orthodoxy of ratings for a new orthodoxy of the Charter, where every mainstream New Zealand programme must account for minority tates and carry the baggage of social engineering.
