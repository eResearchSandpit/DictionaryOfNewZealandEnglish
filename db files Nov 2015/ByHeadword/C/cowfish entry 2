Quote: A Mr A. E. Gibson tried three times to raise whitebait to the adult stage, concluding that they "are what we call cowfish or inanga." <i>Ibid.</i> 61 <i>In March 1932, when coming along at high tide or just after it had receded, I noticed Inanga everywhere amongst the rushes and in one pool which the tride had left, it seemed as if, say two buckets of milk had been thrown in. This was full of fish, evidently just spawning.</i> This is the origin of the name "cowfish" sometimes used for this species.

Quote: The adult minnow [<i>Galaxias attenuatus</i>], which migrates down-stream during February and march, is at this season known to Hokitika fishermen by the seemingly misapplied appellation of `cowfish'. It is, however, on account of the fact that, when captured, milk-like ova or semen comes away from the body of the fish that this name has been so readily adopted.
