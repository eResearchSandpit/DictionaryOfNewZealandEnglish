Quote: `It looks different to me. You've always got to be the boss. Is that just pakeha, or is it being a man? Let me just be myself. Don't try to make me be like you. Then we'll get along fine. But don't try to colonize me. You do it all the time.' Colonize. A strange word for her; must have learnt it in school. Why the English came out here: to colonize New Zealand. That would be pretty hard for them to take : Maori kids, being told how they were colonized.
