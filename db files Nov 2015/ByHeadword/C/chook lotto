Quote: [Hdg] 'Chook lotto' for title... Ford's series leader Marcos Ambrose and Holden's Mark Scaife have joined New Zealand driver Murphy in complaining about the "chook lotto" qualifying concept introduced at Eastern Creek... Skaife's Holden racing team have also dismissed the system as "chook lotto" and "names out of a hat".
