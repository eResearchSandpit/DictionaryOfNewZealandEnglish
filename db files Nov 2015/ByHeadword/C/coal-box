Quote: When the Squadrons had beaten into the `long grass' of adjacent gullies and the Headquarters Sergt. was busy getting his neddies off the lines, he suddenly got an earful of an oncoming shell and immediately camouflaged by trying to look like the of[sic] side of a pack saddle - the only cover handy. The coal-box lobbed about 20 yards away and gently rolled against the other side of the saddle - a dud. P.S. Have often wondered if the Sergeant tip-toed away in case it woke up.
