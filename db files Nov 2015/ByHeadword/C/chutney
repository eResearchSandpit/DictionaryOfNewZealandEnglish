Quote: In New Zealand, chutney, is most often made with fruit, including dried fruit such as raisins. It is usually sweeter than a pickle, and is cooked long enough to develop a thick, jammy consistency. There is a fresh chutney which is made of chopped fresh fruit, herbs or coconut and is served as soon as it is ready. Fresh chutney is closer in style to the original chatni, the Indian word from which chutney is derived, than to the savoury jam that we call chutney, which had its origins in Britain.
