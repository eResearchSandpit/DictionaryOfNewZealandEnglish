Quote: The best means of dealing with Californian thistle where the ground is suitable is continuous cultivation of the plot affected, either by ploughing or grubbing. <i>Ibid.</i> 346 Amongst the many noxious weeds that harass New Zealand agriculture Californian thistle (<i>Cnicus arvensis)</i> is generally ranked as the most widespread and most injurious... Californian thistle is a native of Europe, and is there known as field, creeping, or corn thistle. In New Zealand the name Canadian thistle is also often applied to the plant. Notwithstanding its name of Californian, that State is one of the few in the Union where it is altogether absent. [footnote]
