Quote: <i>Carpet shark Cephaloscyllium isabella </i>Alternative names include swell shark (from its ability to inflate with water or air) and catshark (its eyes are like a cat's). The latter is more appropriate than carpet shark as a common name; the true tropical to subtropical carpet sharks are unrelated.
