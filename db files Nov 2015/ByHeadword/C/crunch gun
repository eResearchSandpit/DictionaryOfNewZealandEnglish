Quote: We call the Hun 210mm a `crunch gun', happy terminology. The giant shell thrown by this gun, slow in flight, is fired very accurately, and it is the supreme cruncher of casas. <i>Ibid.</i>124 `The crunch gun on a road crossing,' says Hadfield to me. He is correct. We call the Hun 210 mm. a `crunch gun,' happy terminology. The giant shell thrown by this gun, slow in flight, is fired very accurately, and it is the supreme cruncher of <i>casas</i>. Turned upon the infantry, it crunches to shreds flesh and bones, mortar and stone, steel and rock without discrimination. It is the ultimate destroyer, the arch weapon.
