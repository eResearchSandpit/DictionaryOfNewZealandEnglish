Quote: I'd like to see them ... racing the chain, that remorseless heartless chain. And when the last is scrubbed and the chain is switched off, going down for a shower ... I'd like to see them on the chain. Even the learners' chain. In that narrow cell of concrete with the lambs swinging in quick time up the ramp from the sticking-pen ... Lambs hooked on to the chain and progressing slowly along while the row of men standing alongside slash and tear and nick with knives while others punch briskets or pull the skins from the swinging carcases. More men rip out the guts and throw the heart and liver on to the small-goods table ... and the skins and innards and hooves and ears all go by chutes to the departments below.
