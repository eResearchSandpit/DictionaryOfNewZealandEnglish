Quote: Despite the fact that by 1820 the Bay of Islands was already "over-run by cow itch", a potent herbal vermifuge, the spiny seeds of which transfix and kill intestinal worms (which plant Maori gave "Marion du Fresne the credit of having left among them" in 1772), early pakeha planting lists barely mention medicinal herbs.
