Quote: I sat up there for an hour before I thought of cooeeing for Gus. I heard Gus cooee back and then he came blundering through the darkness towards me. He had been rambling about since dusk looking for me under the impression that I was bushed. His last `Cooee' brought him within a chain of me, and when he heard me answer he started to go crook.

Quote: <i>Cooee:</i> A call (described in [1898 Morris Austral-English]) The use of the cry seems to be dying out rather; but the word will probably survive in the expression <i>not within cooee</i>, meaning `nowhere near'. I have heard musterers who could not whistle use a cooee to stop their dogs. ([1874 Kennaway Crusts], p.68; [1857 Paul Letters from Canterbury], p.18; [1898 Morris Austral-English])
