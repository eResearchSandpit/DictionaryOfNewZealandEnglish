Quote: "The music of the night is unashamedly camptastic gay anthems," Brown continues, "So Kylie, Geri, Gwen Stefani, Mariah, Madonna, Whitney, Tina Cousins and other such divas will feature heavily, and in a departure from many similar events there will be no drag shows, just blatant camp music, cheap drinks and loads of fun."
