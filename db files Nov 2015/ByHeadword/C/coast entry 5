Quote: The word `Nati' may need explaining. It is used for men and horses on the East Coast - but not by outsiders! It is an abbreviation of the tribal name Ngati Porou. As a name for the numerous wild and half-wild horses of the region it has replaced another Maori colloquialism, `taika'. That name came from `Tiger', the first horse to be seen on the Coast, a piebald stallion given by Tamati Waka Nene to Waka Perohuka of Poverty Bay in exchange for the canoe, Te Toki-a-Tapiri.
