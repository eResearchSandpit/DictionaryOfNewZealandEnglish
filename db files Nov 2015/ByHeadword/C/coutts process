Quote: The new Standard Brewery at Palmerston North is justly claimed to be the world's first brewery to produce its total output by continuous fermentation. ... The process has been patented and is known as the `Coutts' Process after Mr Morton W. Coutts, Technical Director of Dominion Breweries Ltd, under whose guidance the process was initiated and first put into commercial use in 1956.
