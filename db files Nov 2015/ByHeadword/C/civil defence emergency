Notes: Jim Cameron writes: This term originated in the Civil Defence Act 1983. The earlier equivalent 1962-83 was "major disaster". The Britiish concept of civil defence is a response to enemy action; neither <i>civil defence emergency</i> nor its less formal variant <i>civil emergency</i> (as to which see Dominion 2/12/1999 p1), nor <i>state of emergency</i> is in NSOD or Collins.
