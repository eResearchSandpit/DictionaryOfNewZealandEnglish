Quote: Caperberries : You may have noticed them draped over your martini glass in the hottest bars. Quite simply, caperberries are the new olive. Moreover, because they come attached to their stalks, they make an effective seduction tool. One can nibble the delicious, plump green fruit straight from the shaft in a manner that'll get you thrown out of under-aged premises.
