Quote: It is true that this is primarily a trampers' hut, but trampers don't usually carry periodicals in their swags. ... But here the two journals are now, and I wish I knew how often they are read by the other users of this shelter - rabbiters, deer-cullers, roadmen, storm-bound swaggers, and so on.

Quote: When deer were first released in the early days of the colony it was little anticipated what the result would be. When their numbers grew out of hand the government committed itself to doing something about it and so inaugurated the day of the government deer-culler. When the cullers had come and gone they left behind a classic emblem of the hills: the orange-painted, four- or six-bunk Forest Service hut. ... They became home for a generation of cullers and, when these moved out, a later influx of trampers.
