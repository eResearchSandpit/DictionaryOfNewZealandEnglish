Quote: For instance, when auriferous quartz reefs were first discovered in Victoria, a claim for four men was only 24 feet square, and it therefore happened that in some of the richest claims on the Sailor's Gully Reef at Forest Creek the surface claim-holders knocked the bottoms out of their shafts at a depth of about 20 feet - a result which will readily be understood by all who are acquainted with the ordinary angular direction of the `dip' in quartz reefs.
