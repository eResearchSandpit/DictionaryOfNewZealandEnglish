Quote: ..the curing practice here is to cut the mature plant down a little above the ground and split the butt to within 2in. or 3 in. of the end; it is then threaded on to a curing-stick. These sticks are an inch or two over 4 ft long and 1 in. in diameter. If the distance between curing-sticks on the tier-poles is reckoned at 8in, it is now possible to work out the accommodation required for curing the crop.
