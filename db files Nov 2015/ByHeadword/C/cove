Quote: `The Bloke That Ran across a Snag' (also in 1950 Woodhouse Farm and Station Verse 31) So they started in, or Dick did, Brice had work to dodge his blows;/ But he dodged them - how he done it, not a bloke as seen it knows!/ And the other joker maddened when he couldn't touch his man,/ While we coves all laughed and shouted, and the barracking began./

Quote: There is coves and coves! Some I liked partic'lar, and some I would sooner I never knowed,/ But a bloke can't choose the chaps that he's thrown with in the harvest paddock or here in the road./ There was chaps from the other side that I shore with that I'd like to have taken along for mates,/ But we said, `So long!' and we laughed and parted for good and all at the station gates./
