Quote: A chicken tractor is a moveable chicken pen with no base that allows hens to fertilize and scratch over the soil while at the same time eating household scraps and producing organic eggs. I built the chicken tractor last winter out of recycled timber and wire, and added nest boxes made from old wooden nail boxes.
