Quote: At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.
