Quote: 30 Tuesday, 18 April. Mr K spent the weekend on the East Coast, addressing a Jaycees' conference in Hastings, and a Maori Labour Party conference in Gisborne. ... He's told us about being at a Maori gathering when a pakeha said unthinkingly, `He's as cunning as a Maori dog'. It appeared to have gone unnoticed until a Maori remarked, `He's as cunning as a pakeha dog.' Mr K enjoyed that.
