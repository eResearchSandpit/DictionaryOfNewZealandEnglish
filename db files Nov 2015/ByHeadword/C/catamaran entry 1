Quote: ... a kind of sledge, known as a catamaran, or, in bushmen's language, the `cat'. It consisted of two hard wood runners, about thirty feet in length, with two mortised and cross-bolsters about ten feet apart, on which the logs were placed, and well chocked. In order to prevent the runners from catching on the skids they were rounded off with an upwards snipe, and this was done at both ends, thus avoiding the necessity of the turning the cat around for the return trip.

Quote: To transport the timber on these [skidded, i.e. corduroy] roads a `catamaran' would be constructed. This consisted of two heavy hard-wearing pieces of timber, rata for preference, with up-turned ends and 20-30 feet in length. They formed runners, spaced apart by two heavy crosspieces bolted to them. On these the logs lay.

Quote: It was astonishing the tremendous loads they could pull out of the bush along the ground - `snigging', that was called. In many places the logs were brought out on what was called a `cat', which was short for catamaran. A catamaran was a big heavy sledge made of bush timber ... The bushmen would build a special road for them - a corduroy road, or `skidded' road, as we used to call it.
