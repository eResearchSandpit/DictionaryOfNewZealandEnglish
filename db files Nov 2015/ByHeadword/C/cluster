Quote: Clusters are the latest fashion in business development... With Industry New Zealand funding waiting to be claimed, a cluster could also provide a job for an organiser. Or part-time work for more than one person. In that sense, the fad for clusters is a little like the old public service with people paid by the government - which is better than simply getting the dole because the government funding may in turn help to create a self-paying job.
