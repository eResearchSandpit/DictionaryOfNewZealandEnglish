Quote: [Hdg] Become a chokoholic... Auntie May had chokos for Africa and loved the share them. If you visited her during the choko season you would enjoy choko canapes with a glass of sherry, choko soup for lunch and chokos in a white sauce for dinner. Large bags of chokos were given to you on departure.
