Quote: Crevicing: This simple method consisted of scraping out cracks in rock bars or in rock masses once covered by the river. Good gold can be got this way but you must persist until you have scraped out every last particle of dirt and gravel. In fact, in any kind of fossicking always remember that the gold will have worked its way down as far as it can.
