Quote: <i>Catch.</i> Just before stopping time in a wool shed, a shearer tries to finish the sheep he is on and catch another which he can finish at ease after knock-off. This is called <i>getting a catch</i> e.g. `How many more can you do this run?' `Two and a catch.' (C.)

Quote: No man, even if he were actually in the pen could bring another sheep out on the board after the bell had gone [for smoko etc]. For the last 10 minutes of each run, the men would endeavour to select sheep which would enable them to just beat the gong and get an extra sheep. This was known as `getting the catch.' With the old New Zealand hours of 5.30 to 5.30, the day was broken into 6 `runs', and getting a `catch' each time meant another half a dozen sheep to the day's tally.

Quote: A `catch' of course is the sheep a shearer has on the board when the gong goes for time up, he then being allowed to shear or finish it. <i>Ibid.</i>  155 CATCH. The last sheep of a mob. Very often this sheep produces one extra for the tally of the shearer who shears well enough to catch it first. In a tough mob, shearers will acclaim the `catch' as `the one we've been looking for all day.'

Quote: <i>Catch</i>. A sheep that a shearer pulls out from the catching pen. In the few minutes before knock-off, each shearer tries to finish the sheep actually being shorn and catch another one, which, if started before the bell, can be finished at leisure and is an easy addition to one's tally. Aiming to get a sheep before the bell is termed `going for the catch'.
