Quote: <i>Red rock lobster Jasus edwardsii </i>... Closely related to <i>J. novaehollandiae</i> of southern Australia and <i>J. lalandii</i> of South Africa ... `Crayfish' has been regularly used as a common name, although it is more properly applied to freshwater species. Some combination of `red', `spiny', and `rock lobster' is more appropriate.

Quote: Amongst the Crustacea is the <i>koura</i>, which is the general name for both the sea cray fish and the fresh water; the former is nearly two feet long, and abundant on all the rocky shores; the latter is from four to eight inches long. The Rotorua lakes abound with the largest, but near Paparoa, on the Wanganui, I met with one nearly a foot long.
