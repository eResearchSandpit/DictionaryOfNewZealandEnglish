Quote: Captain Cook turned two pigs loose; but it is stated on authority that these pigs left no descendants. One was ridden to death by Maori boys, and the other was killed for sacrilege: he rooted in a tapu burial place. Nevertheless, the settlers still call any wild-pig, especially if lean and bony, a `Captain Cook'.

Quote: The lean-ness and roughness of the wild pig gives it quite a different appearance from the domesticated variety; and hence a gaunt, ill-shaped, or sorry-looking pig is everywhere called in derision a `Captain Cook.'
