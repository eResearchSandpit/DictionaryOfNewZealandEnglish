Quote: The men behind the abortive coup were the remnants of the credit reformers, or Leeites, in the caucus of the 1930s: Mason (who detested Nash), Bill Anderton, and Nordmeyer who, while probably never a creditite, had been numbered in the ranks of the dissidents as an ambitious young `stirrer'.
