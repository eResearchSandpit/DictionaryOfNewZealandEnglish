Notes: Captain Cook's crest, scurvy grass.  A rare plant, Lepidium oleraceum, with celery-like leaves, used by James Cook as a fresh green to combat scurvy. Loosely used, the term scurvy grass covers a range of brassicaceous herbs in New Zealand, but the specific Lepidium oleraceum, now endangered, was in plentiful supply in the time of Cook's visits.

Quote: Cook's Scurvy Grass <i>Lepidium oleraceum</i> nau... It was once common, but is now fairly rare partly due to grazing by stock, and perhaps partly to the appetite of the cabbage white butterfly. <i>Ibid.</i> As its common name suggests, the plant was however used by Captain Cook as a remedy for scurvy, a disease caused by lack of vitamin C in the diet.

Quote:  [=NAU] A voyager on Cook's third voyage in <i>Discovery</i> in 1772, Dr Sparrman, notes that `the green stuffs which were cooked with pease and broth or used as salads, consisted of wild celery (<i>Apium prostratum</i>), wild spinach (<i>Tetragonia expansa</i>) and Cook's scurvy grass (<i>Lepidum oleraceum</i>).' The last mentioned, known as nau by the Maori, has nowadays been virtually eaten out of existence by sheep and cattle.
