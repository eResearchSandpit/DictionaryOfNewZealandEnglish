Quote: The only point I would mention is the scab question. ... I have kept mustering [the Severn Block] to get in the wild sheep and my station diary will show that I have spent about [pounds]300 cleaning it. ... And after the country has been cleaned at my expense, ... you propose ... to place the whole of the Amuri in danger ... At last after enormous effort the Amuri is clean ...
