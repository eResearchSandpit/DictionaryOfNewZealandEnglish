Quote: A rare insect to be found near the track, out to the World War II fortifications, is the Cook Strait click beetle. The Cook Strait click beetles have long lost their ability to click, so have to rely on their bark colouring to merge into the tree trunks from which they eat lichen and oozing sap.
