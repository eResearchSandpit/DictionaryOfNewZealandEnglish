Quote: Where do we go from here? Into the cactus every time. orig. WW2 for the remote desert (cf the blue), but also for any remote place: also used in the Pacific theatre as the code name ofGuadalcanal (fide K.L. Warren, RNZAF 1942), a rough and remote place then: the term perhaps originated in US (cf Am Thes Slang 1942) for `the desert', `the range' -

Quote: <i>Up the boo-ay</i> means `altogether wrong'. This seems to me a commoner meaning for <i>boo-ay</i> than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the<i> Pelican History of New Zealand</i>, with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <i>woop woops</i> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as<i> wook wooks</i>), the sticks, the tea tree and <i>the cactus</i>, some semantic differentiation is not impossible. It must be pointed out that my meaning for <i>up the boo-ay</i> is already supplied by <i> up the chute,</i> however.
