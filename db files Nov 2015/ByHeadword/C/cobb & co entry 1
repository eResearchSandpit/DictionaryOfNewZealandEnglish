Definition:(Cobb and Co. never operated in NZ, but it was usual for coach-line proprietors to use the name Cobb and Co in the proprietary titles of their lines. J.

Quote: Cobb and Co., as a company or business, never operated here, although curiously, the name was used. Cobb and Co. was an Australian company, formed in 1854 by some Americans (including one Freeman Cobb) which operated express waggons out of Melbourne... When the Otago gold discoveries became known in 1860, a Melbourne coach driver, Charles Cole, chartered a ship and brought his coach and horses to Dunedin in October 1861 and set up the first coach line, Cobb and Co., C.C. Cole and Co., proprietors. The name Cobb was used as a traditional one in respect of the "first" coach line, and also as a means of advertising, for which a licence fee was paid in some instances.
