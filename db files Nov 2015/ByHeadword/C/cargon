Quote: [Postal workers'] There was [postal] work [in the 1960s], hard satisfying work. Unloading parcel bags, huge cumbersome containers nicknamed pre-fabs, from a three-door Z. There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars with precision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of cobbers.
