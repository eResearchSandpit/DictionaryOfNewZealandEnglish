Quote: AUTHOR: Then, early in 1960, the CAS in Otago - INTERVIEWER: CAS? Explain. AUTHOR: The Community Arts Service of the Regional Councils for [197] Adult Education. They hardly exist now, except for a little music, but they performed an invaluable service for isolated communities before television. They had opera, theatre, ballet or music three or four times a year; ... a CAS visit was a real communal work-out.
