Quote: If what the [Fishing Industry] Board called 'current retrenchment' continued, 1979 and 1980 catches might be as low as 88,000 and 100,000 tonnes, respectively. Current retrenchment referred to problems being experienced by a number of major South Island companies. Catching less-familiar species was all very well, but they had to be solved.
