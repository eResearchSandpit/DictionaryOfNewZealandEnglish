Definition:Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <i>copper</i>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <i>Maori copper</i>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <i>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <i>- kopa Maori</i> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <i>*kopa Pakeha; </i>

Quote: It having been discovered on board that most of [the bread] which we had in Butts was damp and Mouldy; to day a Copper Oven was brought on Shore and fixed up by the Tent to rebake it.' (5) Whatever is the case, the term seems to be influenced by English copper, which could transliterate as something like <i>*kopara, *kapara</i> in the early 19th century. cf. also Markham's trasliteration of <i>kapura</i> (1834 NZ 38): the Natives told him to his Teeth ... they would put (Corpora) Fire to it.<i> [Note irrelevantly that the English word boiler was transliterated into Maori as paera, its early or dial. variant pron. /bail*/.] 1. (Arranged under predominant spg forms.)</i>
