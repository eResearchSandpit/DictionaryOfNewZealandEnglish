Quote: The offenders who once were confined there,/ Were mostly townsfolk, I've heard say,/ And the Governor treated them kind there,/ And held out inducements to stay;/ For the weather and time had so peppered/ This tumble-down crib, I declare/ That it didn't require a Jack Sheppard/ To find his way quick out of there.

Quote: He [the pioneer pastoralist] has built a domicile of some sort, be it of canvas, calico, bagging, sticks, ferntrees, grass, slabs, mud, clay, stone, or wattle and daub. He may call it various names according to its materials, but three names would not enter his head - i.e., crib, bach, or shack. He may call it a cabin, a shanty, a cottage, a warrie [whare], but probably he would use the commonest term of all - hut.
