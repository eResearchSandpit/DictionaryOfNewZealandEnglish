Quote: The so called road between French's & Barriball's clearing ...[sic] is really the worst part of the line as it is so thickly overgrown [96] with makos &c. The tracks were destroyed by the pigs but there were still traces [of Maori] - one a mako stick cut, & others some hairs of a mat caught in a stick.

Quote: In one of the lately settled bush districts of the Wellington Province, where the clearings were as yet comparatively few and of no very great extent - ... this story opens. <i>Ibid.</i> 8 A large clearing opened out on the right, and a little way back from the road-line stood a slab hut - or whare [e-acute], as it is generally called in New Zealand - of a rather better appearance than ordinary, from the iron chimney of which issued the smoke which the travellers had seen. Farther back from the road were yards and a larger building evidently used as a wool-shed.
