Quote: A colleague assembling a feature article on people using the Internet to sell houses online, reports that one of her sources referred to relationships between real estate agents as co-opertition. She bridled at this peculiar word, but the agent stoutly defended it as common currency among his brethren. It means, he insisted, a praiseworthy mixture of competition and cooperation.
