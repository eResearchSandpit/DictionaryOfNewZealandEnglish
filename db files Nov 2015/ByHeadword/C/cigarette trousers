Quote:  They were accompanied by a dudish looking young man in about the weirdest-looking suit I ever saw. ... It went in at the waist until it was a wonder the poor devil wearing it didn't snap in half with the strain, and the trousers were of the cigarette variety. [ibid 134] The cheap stuff his suit was made of kept on shrinking and shrinking, and his cigarette trousers had climbed nearly up to his knees.
