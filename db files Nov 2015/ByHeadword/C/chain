Quote: In 1932, wages were cut, and the freezing workers struck throughout the country. The butchers didn't believe that they could be replaced, but when the works reopened it was found that the companies had installed the American chain system, with each worker responsible for only one aspect of the process. The butchers were replaced by the unemployed, who initially made a terrible mess of the carcasses. But in time they became competent process workers, as opposed to the tradesmen who had preceded them.
