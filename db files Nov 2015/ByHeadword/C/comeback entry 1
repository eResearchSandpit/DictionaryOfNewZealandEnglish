Quote: `The Returned Heroes' [title] We are a crowd of come-backs!/ We've fought and swung the lead!/But now we're in New Zealand,/ We might as well be dead!/ And one night in the Town Hall/ I heard the Stokers say:/ `Hoch! Hoch! mein Gott,/ What a very wild lot/ Are the Anzacs of today!' [fn] It might be mentioned that `the Stokers' are the ones who `Keep the Home Fires Burning'.
