Quote: On the way down [the Cook River from Tony's Rock] we saw a cuckoo, and his usual companion the `check-shirt' bird. ... The former is the Maori koe-koea (<i>Eudynamys taitensis</i>), and like his English namesake, he makes use of other birds' nests. The `check-shirt' follows him in his migrations, and is often seen with him in the lower hills.
