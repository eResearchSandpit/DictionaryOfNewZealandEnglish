Quote: Other sweets current at the time were `Cupid's Whispers', ... sen sens, cable-twist, ... butter balls, acid drops ... aniseed balls ... mint rock. There were ponfret cakes (licorice stuff ...) and of course `lucky bags' ... in addition to the sweets they contained they had the gambling element. Some of them contained a three-penny bit ... soon clamped down on by the `wowser' of the day.
