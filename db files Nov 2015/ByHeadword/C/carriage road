Quote: With every step, the effects of the enormous glaciation become more manifest, all mountains and hills have not only the <i>roche moutonnee</i>[e1-acute] form, but glacier shelves at different altitudes and lying one above the other, are cut deeply into the hillsides. Some of these are so regular that the settlers have called them carriage roads, devil's highways, or by some similar epithets.
