Quote: <i>Knucklebones</i> (K-34) was played in both Europe and Polynesia, independently at first. In the nineteenth century distinct European [177] and Maori versions were known. More recently, the two types have merged, and today the Maori children, who are mainly responsible for perpetuating the game in New Zealand, include in their games movements borrowed from the European tradition. ... In most of the provinces the game was known as Knucklebones, and it is widely reported as having been played by New Zealand children of European origin until about 1900. Occasionally it was known as Chucks, Chuckstones, Chuckystones, Fingerstones, Hucklebones, Jacks, Jackstones, Knuckles, or Knucklestones. Children still played it here and there throughout the country in 1949, but they knew little about it until plastic knuckles were imported in 1954 in large quantities and revived the game.
