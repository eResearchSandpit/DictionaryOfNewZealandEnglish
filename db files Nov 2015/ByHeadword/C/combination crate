Quote: Combination crates appeared and gone were the days when drivers had to crawl on hands and knees to either load or unload their vehicles. Later still we saw the implementation of triple decker crates which meant between seven hundred and eight hundred lambs could be carted on one unit, or forty-odd cattle beasts.
