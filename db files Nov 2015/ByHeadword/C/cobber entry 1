Quote: Cobber.- `Revival' gives a reminder that the much-used `cobber' is a revival of an old word that had a run in the colonies long years ago. The writer gives an opinion that the term came originally from the cockney quarter of London. `Dinkum' was current at least twenty years ago; the war has given it another lease of life.

Quote: Had Andy and Ponto belonged to a later decade, they would have been described in the jargon of the `Cally' as `cobbers.' The word so exactly hits off their relationship, that I must use it. The bond between cobber and cobber has about it no taint of sentiment.
