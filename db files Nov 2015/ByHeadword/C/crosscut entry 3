Quote: The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referred to tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'. <i>Ibid.</i> 317 <i>Crosscut</i>: A tunnel cutting across the reef system. As the shafts were sunk to new levels a main crosscut was put out from the shaft chamber on each level to cut the reefs approximately at right-angles, after which driving in both directions usually started on the first reef, while crosscutting continued until the farthest reef was opened up. It was usually necessary to make a [318] connection with the level above, near the end of the crosscut, for ventilation.
