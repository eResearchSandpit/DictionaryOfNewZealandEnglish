Quote: `Curlew-shooting' (as it [sc Godwit-shooting] is termed in the colony) sometimes, however, becomes more legitimate sport ... [quoting a New Zealand correspondent of <i>The Field:</i>] `Curlew-shooting has just begun; I had a day last week (early in March). The best locality for this kind of shooting is the upper part of Auckland harbour ... [44] The Curlew feed on the mud-flats after the ebbing tide, and the best plan is to choose the time when the flight commences from one coast to the other.
