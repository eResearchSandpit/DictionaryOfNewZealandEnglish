Notes: Believed to be been used first publicly by Mike Moore on the Holmes Show on 26 November, 1993, during the Moore-Clark "affair" and subsequently picked up by various TV and radio commentators but not so obviously by the papers at the time except for a subsequent rather nasty editorial in the Dom. The (later?)English equivalent appears to be "champagne socialist". Bruce Moore (ANU) says 30/4/1999 in an e-mail that "it's been around for at least 6 years, though we haven't been collecting citations coz it's American."
