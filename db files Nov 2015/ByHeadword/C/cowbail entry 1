Quote: This consisted of a very small cowyard and a corrugated iron cow-bail holding two cows at a time. <i>Ibid.</i> 118 He always came to the cow-bail to collect his milk. <i>Ibid.</i>147 My cow-bail, situated in the middle of a wood, was in excellent order, with a nice concrete yard, easy to clean, and with a tap and hose handy. ...The cows were driven into a small yard and then into the bail, which held two at a time. They walked into position and were not tied up, but a chain hooked around their hindquarters kept them from backing out, and when I had finished milking there was a door in front of their heads which I opened with the aid of a long rope, and the cow walked out into the field again.
