Quote: A head-cooling device designed in New Zealand has become the first treatment to successfully prevent brain damage in oxygen-deprived newborn babies. An International trial of the CoolCap, developed by Auckland University's Liggins Institute, has shown the device significantly reduced the rate of death and disability in babies asphyxiated in the birth process.
