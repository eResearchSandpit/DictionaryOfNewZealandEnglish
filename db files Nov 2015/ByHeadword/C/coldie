Quote: The security man at the gate inspected the bin and took away their grog. I can understand their stopping young men toting a couple of dozen coldies on their back, but two respectable women? What could they possibly do? As they were able to buy two cans inside the Park at inflated prices, I wonder where avarice comes in and commonsense goes out the window?
