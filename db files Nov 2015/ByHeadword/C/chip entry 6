Quote: ... it is no doubt also responsible for the dark coloured varnishes produced from the chip grades. [fn] The terms dust, seeds, chips, nubs, &c., are the names given to certain of the lower kauri gum grades according to the relative sizes of the pieces. From `dust' the size of the fragments increases in the order given, as does also the purity of the grade. Chalk, or `chalky gum,' is a particular grade recovered from swampy country and is characterized by its white or chalky appearance and large water content.

Quote: Lumps of gum weighing half a hundredweight or more have on rare occasions been found, but in general, on the ranges and flats the size varied from an occasional nugget weighing a few pounds down to `nuts' the size of an acorn or smaller. In the peat swamps, however, while large pieces were not uncommon, much of the gum would be smaller still, known as chips.
