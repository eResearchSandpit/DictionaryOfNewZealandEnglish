Quote: [Hdg] Timber yards searched for crazy ants... The crazy ant (Paratrechina longicornis) and yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) cause severe irritation on humans and animals. When disturbed, they run erratically in large numbers... it was possible that crazy ant colonies recently found on Auckland and Mt Maunganui wharves had arrived in New Zealand on sawn timber imported from the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.
