Quote: Here Fitzgerald, the Provincial Superintendent was waiting, and after treating the party to strawberries and cream, took the Bishop and Mrs Harper into Christchurch in his `circulating-medium'. This curiously named dogcart the Superintendent had made himself. It had a pair of wheels 8 or 9 feet high, and though generally driven tandem, Fitzgerald sometimes used in it 3 or even 4 horses.
