Quote: Some breeders claim that the new breed, Corriedale, is a class of sheep which embraces these desired qualities and possesses a fixity of type. The generally accepted meaning of the Corriedale is a sheep resulting from the fourth cross of half-bred Lincoln-merino, and the rams Lincoln. The progeny of these is half-bred. These in turn are bred, half-breds to half-breds, for four generations, and a Corriedale is the result. It was Mr. James Little, of Allandale, Waikari, Canterbury, who gave sheep bred on these lines the distinctive name of `Corriedale.'
