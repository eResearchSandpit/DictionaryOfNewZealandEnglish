Quote: When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

Quote: The `wool-shed' where all shearing is done has a row of pens (`catching-pens' they are called) in it reaching from one end to the other, each pen holding some 25-30 sheep. Opposite each of these are two shearers, who draw their sheep one by one out of their pen until the pen is exhausted. Naturally each man tries to pick a sheep that looks easy to shear, so the last one is generally a great ugly brute with matted wool and his fleece full of sand. This fellow is invariably nicknamed the `cobbler.'

Quote: The `cobbler' used to be the last sheep in a shearing pen probably because he `sticks to the last.' - being usually rough-fleeced or burry or dirty, or otherwise objectionable.... But now we are told that `cobbler is an obs term for a learner'- who would also naturally be `last' to finish his task; [instead of the last sheep in the pen].

Quote: Another job suitable for a new hand is `Sheep O!' The work consists of filling up the `catching pens' when empty. The shearer who takes the last sheep (called the `cobbler') calls out `Sheep O!' when the boy ... immediately fills up the back pen.

Quote: <i>Cobbler</i>. Shearers' slang. Worst sheep to shear in a pen. Two shearers usually catch out of one pen and each takes the easiest sheep he can find, and so downwards until only the hardest and roughest sheep is left. (See [1898 Morris Austral-English] for derivation.)

Quote:  ... `cobbler', a hard-shearing sheep ... <i>Ibid.</i> 129 When an old hand and a young one were sharing a catching pen, the former [130] would let the learner in for the `cobbler', or hard shearing sheep, at the end of every pen, and when the pen had been re-filled, quickly catch and shear all the `rosellas,' or easily shorn sheep, before the unfortunate novice had finished his cobbler.

Quote: Cobbler: The last sheep in a shearer's pen is called the cobbler. It is usually a tough one - hard shearing - and consequently any very hard shearing sheep are called cobblers.

Quote: <i>cobbler</i>: The last sheep left in the catching pen (because it was difficult to shear) is called the `cobbler', a play on `the cobbler's last'. Naturally shearers like to make this their `bell sheep'. It was a simple transfer to use the term `cobbler' or `sandy cobbler' to describe a rough hard sheep at any time. .
