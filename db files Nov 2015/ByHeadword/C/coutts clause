Quote: Protocol Clause 13.12: "Forbids a sailor to swap teams if he had been "contracted, engaged, paid or otherwise engaged" by a team for 180 days since the last cup... The old rule stated that after January 2000, a competitor ahall not engage any person in any capacity who has sailed on another competitor's yacht. It now reads "from March 2 this year a person contracted, employed, paid or otherwise engaged by a competitor, may not be engaged by another competitor." The change was quickly dubbed the "Coutts Clause" and means Coutts, one of the most effective America's Cup skippers in history, is probably out of the preparation for the 2007 challenge in Valencia.
