Quote:  ... the latter is always skirted and classed, whereas the black fleece was rolled up just as taken from the sheep's back, the belly-pieces being also left in. ... For example, white wool divides, when skirted by the roller at the wool-table, thus: Belly pieces, say, 6d. per pound; first pieces, 8d. per pound; ... fragments or locks, 4d. per pound.

Quote: A steam whistle ... blew for the commencement and finish of each run. The wool tables for rolling and skirting were in the centre of the woolboard. Close by stood the classer's table, where he sat and classed each fleece before it was carried by a shed hand to its respective bin.
