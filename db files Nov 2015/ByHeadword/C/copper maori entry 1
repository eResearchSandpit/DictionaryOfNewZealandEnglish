Quote: Coppre [<i>kopa</i>] Mourie, or the Native Ovens are described I rather think in Captain Cookes Voyages. They are done this way. They scratch a hole 8 or 10 inches deep and two Feet in Diameter and then light the Fire in the hole; when the fire is at its best. They cover it all over with Stones The size of Potatoes or what you would put on the roads in England. They are well heated and [when] the fire dies down a wet cloth of Mat is put round the edge. The Potatoes having been scraped with Shells, are laid on the hot stones. A small Calebash of Water is thrown over the stones & Potatoes and fire first taken out, a tremendous steam arises, and a wet mat is laid over all and then covered up with six or seven inches of Earth, left for three quarters of an hour, and then they are beautifully done so you see these Potaotes Pies. The Natives now begin to use Iron pots, known to them by the name of, `Go on Shores,'* from the circumstance of Boats going up and down the Rivers, coming to an Anchor and going on Shore to Cook, but the Natives prefer the Old plan and I think they are right.

Quote: [Maori copper [one of the first times Chudleigh spells <i>Maori</i> correctly : usually Mouray]] We roasted half a sheep in a Maori copper, that is first dig a hole in the ground in proportion to the thing you want to cook. Line the bottom and sides with stones as big as a breakfast cup then light a fire over them till they are quite red hot throwing in more loose stones to put on the top. Then take out all the ashes, wrap your meat in green grass put it in the pit, throw the loose stones on top and cover the whole with sods of grass, clay or anything that will keep the steam in, three or four hours will cook your meat to perfection.

Quote: ~ This spelling has been influence by the English word <i>Copper</i>, but it is really a corruption of a Maori word. There is a difference of opinion amongst Maori scholars what this word is. Some say <i>Kapura</i>, a common fire used for cooking, in contradistinction to a `chief's fire,' at which he sat sat, and which would not be allowed to be defiled with food. Others say <i>Kopa</i>. The Maori word <i>Kopa</i> was (1) <i>adj</i> meaning <i>bent</i>, (2)<i> angle</i> or <i>corner</i>, and (3) the native oven, or more strictly the hole scooped out for the oven.
