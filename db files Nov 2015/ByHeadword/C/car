Quote: The Car scheme was aimed at individuals rather than groups. In 1930, Shelley persuaded the Carnegie Corporation of New York to provide him with enough money, over a period of years, to set up a travelling library. A small van was purchased and, with a pun, was labelled Car, for Canterbury Adult Rural education scheme.
