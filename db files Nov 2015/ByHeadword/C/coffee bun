Notes: Jim writes: The standard name in Wellington in the 1940s for what I had known as <i>sally lunn</i> (in British dictionaries)- a small round bun whose top was covered with icing and (often) desiccated coconut. <i>Coffee bun</i> is not recorded in the OED or any other dictionary I have seen. Its use as a NZ term may be worth investigation. DEH adds : I agree but I think of it as a large round cake-sized bun.
