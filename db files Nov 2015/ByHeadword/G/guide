Quote:  The guide's eyes sparkle, Hitchcok's are opaque... "In the era in which I was guiding, the people did't come to stay for an night and go away the next morning"... In the 1930s the guides were licensed by the Tourism Department and had to pass stringent tests set by the department and iwi of knowledge and fluency of Maori and English.
