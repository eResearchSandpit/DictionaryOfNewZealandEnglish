Quote:  If the inhabitants of Ryde, Australiam, can openm a Granny Smith Memorial Park to celbrate their wodl-famous applle variety, then surely Greytown hcan do the same with the Gala, which was developed there in the 1920s by J H Kidd, who cossed Golden Delicious with his own Kidd's Orange Red, itself a cross of Cox's Orange and Red Delicious. He first releaed it in 1934,  and it was introduced to the US in 1981.
