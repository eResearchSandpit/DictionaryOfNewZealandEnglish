[34] This name is applied both to the skipper (<i>Scombresox Forsteri</i>) and to the ihi or half-beak, which are allied fishes representing those of the same names in the British seas. The representatives of the former genus, however, though common in England, appear to be rare in these seas, while the half-beak, which is of rare occurrence in the British seas, is common all round New Zealand, and is the ordinary gar-fish that is so highly appreciated, especially in Auckland and Dunedin.

Quote:  In England the name is applied to any fish of the family <i>Belone Vulgaris</i>. In Melbourne the <i>Garfish</i> is a true one, <i>Belone ferox</i>, Gunth., called in Sydney `Long Tom.' In Sydney,  Tasmania, and New Zealand it is <i>Hemirhamphus intermedius</i>, Cantor.; and in New South Wales, generally `Guard-fish,' and it is the river-fish <i>H. regularis</i>, Gunth., family <i>Sombresocida</i>. Some say that the name was originally `Guard-fish,' and it is still  sometimes so spelt. But the word is derived from <i>Gar</i>, in Anglo-Saxon, which meant spear, dart, javelin, and the allusion is to the long spear-like projection of the fish's jaws. Called by the <i>Sydney fishermen</i> Ballahoo, <i>and in Auckland</i> the Piper (q.v.).
