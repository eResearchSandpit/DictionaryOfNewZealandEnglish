Quote:  He [Captain Toms] was a very old whaler ... he had had most of the principal bones of his body broken by whales flukes but when I met him he was what the whalers called `gallid' or afraid even of the sight of a whale. I expect his nerves were hurt when his bones were broken.

Quote:   [glossary] Gallied - An alarmed or frightened whale. These often take off at high speed, or sound for extended lengths of time. Often gallied whales will adapt zig-zag swimming patterns under water, No Perano chasers were equipped with sonar, which meant that the erratic movements of a

whale underwater were much more difficult for them to follow.
