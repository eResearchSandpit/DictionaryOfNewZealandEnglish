Quote:  Geckos may be various shades of brown or grey, but the North Island green gecko, or kakariki, is the commonest in the Urewera. Its Maori name comes from the chattering sound it makes, like that of its namesakes, the red and yellow-crowned parakeets.

Quote:  NEW ZEALAND is home to two types of geckos, which have generally been described as green (<i>Naultinus</i> genus), and brown (<i>Hoplodctylus</i> genus) geckos. .. Green geckos are relatively easy to distinguish due to their diurnal life-style and their Kermit-green colour schemes, which can include white, yellow or gold stripes, or diamonds on their backs.
