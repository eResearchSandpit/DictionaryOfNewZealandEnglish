Quote:  The Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS) will receive $5 million per year over the next decade for its "Geonet" project, to be spend on modernising and expanding the array of instruments that, since the 70s, has monitored disturbances below the Taupo volcanic region and off the coast of the lower North Island.
