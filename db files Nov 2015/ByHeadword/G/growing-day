Quote:  From this data we may conclude that every variety of wheat has a definite amount of growth to make, which occupies a definite number of normal "growing-days" (according to the variety grown) .. the remedy lies, when spring-sowing, in the selection of a variety which will not require a greater number of "growing-days" in a normal season.. Each variety of wheat, grown under normal conditions, will require a certain number of "growing-days" after seeding before it is fully developed..The number of growing days required varies according to the variety.
