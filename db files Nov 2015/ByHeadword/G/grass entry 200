Quote:  A kind of carpet grass was also in abundance. It grows in a dense mass and when one walks across it, especially on a steep slope, caution has to be exercised, for, if one slipped, he would go skating for yards, gathering speed all the way, as if he had slipped on ice. This carpet grass was like a very minute rush and grew thicker than grass on a well-grassed lawn.
