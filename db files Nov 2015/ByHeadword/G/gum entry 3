Quote:  Note. In speaking of Mercury Bay I had forgot to mention that the Mangrove trees found there produce a resinous substance very much like rosin, something of this kind I am told is found in both the East and West Indias.

The `resinous substance' was kauri gum ,the exudation of the great kauri tree, Agathis australis, washed down the river ..., or caught in the mangroves on the way.]
