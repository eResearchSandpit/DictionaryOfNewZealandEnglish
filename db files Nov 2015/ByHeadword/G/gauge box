Quote:  `When other and more accurate means of measuring water are not conveniently available, it may be done by using gauge boxes of the dimensions ... `The gauge box shall be 12 feet long, 20 inches or 40 inches wide, inside measurements ... in accordance with the undermentioned table ... In other words, if the depth of the pressure above the board, above the top of the aperture, is five inches, the aperture is twenty inches wide, and two inches deep, the number of sluice heads discharged is one.'
