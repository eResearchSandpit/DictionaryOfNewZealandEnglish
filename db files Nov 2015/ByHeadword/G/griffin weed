Quote:  Vervain (<i>Verbena officinalis</i>), a species few would suspect of harm, but which by overrunning grass has proved a nuisance in a small way, is an alien of note. It has invaded us from the north, a quarter from which comparatively few road-plants have come. Its proper name has been temporarily lost, it has been renamed, and, what must be almost unique in popular botanical nomenclature, that name again lost and the plant locally rechristened ; finally, it has resumed its correct designation. This alien from southern England appeared near Frazertown in the late 'seventies. It was first noticed on a station belonging to Mr Nairn; there it began to spread, and there it became known as Nairn's weed; the station then became the property of the late Mr Griffin. Now Mr Griffin, as chairman of the Wairoa County Council, touched the business and bosom of every up-country settler in the district. People knew him who did not know and had never known his predecessor; his office advertised the plant : presently, even in the [299] immediate vicinity of its origin, the earlier designation was dropped, the later one assumed. It became known up and down the east coast as `Griffin's Weed'.
