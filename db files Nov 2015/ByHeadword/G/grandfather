Quote:  Your correspondent correctly notes that in 1998 the council introduced a policy which meant higher fees and also undertook to "grandfather" current fees for 10 years. It is also correct that the council adopted a new policy this year which does not include this "grandfathering" fee... The new policy is consistent and fair and that means "grandfathering" of the traditional fees is no longer necessary.

Quote:  Brenda Walker wants to know what the dickens a local council was talking about in saying road encroachment fees would be grandfathered. The city fathers had undertaken to grandfather current fees for 10 years to defer the burden on those who had to pay them. I don't see the point in using this obscure term, except to show how knowledgeable you are, since the meaning is simply to defer the darn things. The technical meaning of a grandfather clause is temporary exemption from a law for people who were doing whatever they were doing at the time when legislation was passed. Originally, it referred to laws restricting voting to those who had the franchise before the  American Civil War.
