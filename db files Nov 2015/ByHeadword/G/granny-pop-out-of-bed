Quote:  There is a triffid climbing over my back fence; that twining, strangling convolvulus known as bindweed - or more companionably by children as Granny-Pop-Out-of-Bed (a reference to the admittedly attractive, delicate, white flowers that make a satisfying pop when squeezed between the fingers). <i>Calystegia sylvatica</i> is its botanical name and a plague on all its houses!
