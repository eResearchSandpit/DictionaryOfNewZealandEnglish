Quote:  [reference to shifting house on Wellington Coast 1850s] I do not [34] know how many real carriers we had, but altogether they [the Maoris] looked quite a large company each man ready to put his `goovy' (Maori carrying girdle) as we called it, round the load appointed, and get it on to his shoulders.
