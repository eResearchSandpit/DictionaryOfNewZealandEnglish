Quote:  Geysers appear to be very short-lived in geological time. Today, you can find in the scrub at Whakarewarewa about 65 geyser vents but in historical time there has never been more than about 16 playing at the same time... We have destroyed about 150 geysers in New Zealand in the last few decades and we were on the brink of losing them all.
