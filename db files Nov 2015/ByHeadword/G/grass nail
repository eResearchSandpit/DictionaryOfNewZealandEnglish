Quote:   If grass were to be mown, a stout piece of round iron, much more in diameter then a No. 7 wire, was fastened through the butt of the blade and a hole on the upper end was set to contain an ordinary screw into the wooden snaith. This gave stiffness to the blade and also gathered the cut grass in its sweep toward the winrow for the wooden rakes in the hands of the sun-bonneted women who followed. The stay was termed a grass nail.
