Quote:   <i>Sporobolus elongatus</i> is generally known as `Rat's-tail grass' as far south as Lake Taupo; but at Port Waikato it is called `Chilean-grass,' as it is erroneously supposed to have been introduced with the so-called `Chilian groundsel' <i>Erigeron canadensis</i>, a plant which appears to have been brought to this colony with grass seed from South America.

Quote:  fn Chilian grass or Rat's-tail (<i>Sporobolus indicus</i>), according to the late Bishop Williams, `made its first appearance at the Bay of Islands in 1840, shortly after the arrival of a ship called the <i>Surabayo</i>, which, while on a voyage from Valparaiso to Sydney laden with horses and forage, put into the Bay of Islands in a disabled state, and was there condemned and her cargo sold. From the Bay of Islands the plant spread south to Auckland. There, whilst on a holiday in the 'nineties, it was noticed by Harry Young flourishing on light sandy lands.
