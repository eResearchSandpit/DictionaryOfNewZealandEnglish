Quote:  Mrs Shannahan has been using a mobility scooter since she lost both legs in 1999.... Mrs Shannahan said the term "grey racer" was fitting for many who rumbled through Masterton streets. While the most hi-tech scooters could only reach a speed of 10kmh, that was enough to cause harm to pedestrians.
