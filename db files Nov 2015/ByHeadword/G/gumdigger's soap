Quote:  Golden Tainui or Kumarahou (Pomaderris kumeraho) - Another fast growing 2-3m high shrub, northern in origin, but certainly at home in Wellington's clay soils... Gum Diggers Soap is another name for this species. When water is added to leaves and rubbed in the hand, a lather forms.  Seemingly utilised by the gum diggers of old to clean their hands.
