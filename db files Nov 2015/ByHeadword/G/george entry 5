Quote:  The copper or the soldier, / The schoolboy or the guide, / The driver of the gharry,

In which you take a ride.. / No matter who, or what he is, / To us, he's just plain, George.

Quote:  Talking about George (and one does a lot of it out here), it would be interesting to know why every New Zealander, irrespective of the wishes of his godfathers ... should be honoured by his sovereign's patronymic. The NZEF, not to be out-done, describes every Abdul and Hamid as `George', so that between the two the slogan `let George do it', once applied to a well-known New Zealand politician [sc. George Forbes] and to an even better known Australian comedian [George ?], is eminently applicable.
