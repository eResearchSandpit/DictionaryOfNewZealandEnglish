Quote:  Smith played himself and was hired to front and direct a documentary about the fictional town of Ureroa which came under national spotlight because of its notorious residents - The Gooey Duck. The Gooey Duck, a shellfish with a long phallic-like siphon, was hailed as an alternative to Viagra and road-tested by Smith. Seated in a country tavern, Smith selected a battered love mussel from a pile of greasies, ingested it, clapped eyes on Jenny on screen, became viciously aroused, clutched his privates and rushed to the men's to relieve himself.

Quote:  Well, we did at least manage two days [of birthday party], a follow-up dinner being necessary to finish up the leftover seafood, including a quantity of geoduck from Golden Bay. Pronounced "gooey duck", it is admittedly not the sexiest name for a little-known shellfish which, in its natural state, borders upon the obscene; it comprises a shell with a long fat siphon tube and really, ought not to appear in public without a pair of underpants.

Quote:  New Zealand has two native species of the peculiar bi-valve, named after a North Indian word for "to dig deep". The geoduck lives about half a metre beneath the seabed, it extends two long siphons up to the sea floor to act as feeding and water tubes. It is these tubes that are highly sought after in the gourmet world of seafood.
