Quote:  GALINSOGA (<i>Galinsoga parviflora </i> and <i>G. quadriradiata </i>) ... Galinsoga was found by botanists in Peru 200 years ago and taken to London and Paris. It later escaped to become a weed in Europe and other parts of the world. Although recorded in New Zealand in 1896, galinsoga has a limited distribution and is still spreading.
