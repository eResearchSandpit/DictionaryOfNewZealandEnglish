Quote:  After the first few years of settlement [on Banks Peninsula], Orchards were planted, and when `orchard grass' was first sown in 1853, little was it dreamt that it would bring wealth in its trail. It was this grass, cocksfoot, that has made Banks Peninsula known wherever pastures are sown throughout the Empire.
