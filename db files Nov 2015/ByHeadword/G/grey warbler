Quote:  Of the bronze-winged Cuckoo, he tells us that, like its relative at home, it makes use of the nests of other birds, and, of course, relieves itself of the care of providing for its young.   No bird appears to suffer so much from the imposition of this parasite as the Piripiri or Grey Warbler.

the Huia. The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.
