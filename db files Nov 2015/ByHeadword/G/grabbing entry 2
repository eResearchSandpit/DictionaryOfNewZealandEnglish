Quote:  [Quoting Stan Williamson of Moutere on killing wild sheep in Marlborough in 1921). The method was what was known to musterers as `grabbing'. A small mob would be collected as conditions permitted with the heading dog, .... The dog then ran the sheep in behind a bank, fallen tree or boulder on the river bed where they were soon killed.
