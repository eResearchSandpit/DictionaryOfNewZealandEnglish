The Porbeagle (<i>Lamna nasus</i>) has long sharp teeth, each with a small cusp at the base on either side; the Mako (<i>Isurus glaucus</i>) has teeth of similar shape without the cusps, and the Great White Shark (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>) has large triangular teeth with serrated edges. -

Quote:   This delicacy of the English-speaking world is referred to in other circles as `shark and taties', `Maori roast', or `greasies' - understanding all depends on knowing the convention. Once the convention is established, it is just a matter of stating one's preference for two meat patties and a scoop, over a stuffed frankfurter.
