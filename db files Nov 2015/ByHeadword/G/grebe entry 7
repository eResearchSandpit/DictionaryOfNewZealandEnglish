Quote:  Their long white necks, distinctive ruff of chestnut with black edges about the neck, and double black crest on the top of their heads made them unlike any other bird we had seen. Once home we searched through our book of New Zealand birds and located only a single candidate: the southern (or Australasian) crested grebe, <i>Podiceps cristatus australis</i>, a subspecies of the great crested grebe found in Europe, Africa and Asia.
