Quote:  Now, it must be remembered that a Goldfields Warden has large discretionary powers - for if he was to be guided by law, and law only, he would be unfit for his position, for the exigencies of a goldfield, especially on new rushes, calls forth the exercise of that valuable commodity called "common sense," though in many instances this may seem opposed to the strict reading of the law, therefore a Goldfields Warden is allowed some latitude in what may be called the equities of a case.
