Quote:  The Woods was probably the first string binder tried here. [in 1880s]. It was known as the `goose-neck' binder because it had a very long circular arm resembling the neck of a goose,

which threw the sheaves away so effectively that in some cases when opening up a paddock, they went right over the fence.
