Quote:  New Zealand Post was going to shrivel up and die unless the government.. relieved it of the need to deliver "granny mail" (that means our letters)... [17] NZ Post is still with us, still solvent - despite all the money it has lost on (d) - and still delivering us, its embarrassingly pedestrian local owners, our granny mail.
