Quote:  Sir George Grey thought [the Hokioi] might be the extinct New Zealand Eagle, <i>Harpagornis moorei</i>, excavated by von Haast at Glenmark in 1871... A giant eagle, <i>hokoi</i>, features in several Maori legends. One describes a cloaked Maori moving through the forest being mistaken for a moa and carried off by the eagle.
