Quote:  ... many strange and exciting stories of the area were told me by my since departed friend, Fred Simmons, or Fossicking Fred, as he was affectionately called by his workmates, on account of his ability to trace their hideouts, and either bring in or destroy wild or domestic animals that had gone outlaw. <i>Ibid.</i> 111 One station holder, after several attempts had been made to muster some hundreds of domestic cattle that had gone outlaw, offered [pound]1 a head for them, to anyone delivering them at the Station yards.
