Quote:  There are four kinds [of wetas]: the <i>bush-weta, </i> the <i>cave-weta</i>, smaller in body with very long legs and feelers - the rock-weta found under rocks on mountain sides, <i>ground-weta</i>, as small as a cricket and found buried under the soil. ... The male has a huge horny mandibled head, the female a long stout ovipositor which has been stigmatised as a sting and earned for the insect the undeserved names, scorpion, and herself and her mate wood-devil and taipo.
