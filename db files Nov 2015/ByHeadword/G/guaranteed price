Notes: The words are not used in the 1936 Milk Marketing Act which in 1936 was actually the Primary Produce Act and only later in amendments labelled Milk Marketing Act. The act talks about fixing prices and says that "the general purpose shall be to assure to the producer a net return.. equivalent to the return he would have received if such dairy-produce had been acquired by the Crown for export in accordance with the foregoing purposes of this Part of this Act." [Primary produce Marketing Act 1936: NZ Statutes 1 Edw. VIII. Session I 5/70]
