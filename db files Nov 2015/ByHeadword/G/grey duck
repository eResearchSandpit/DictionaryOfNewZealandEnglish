Quote:  I have seen the rarest kind of mountain duck swimming within five yards of me ... as though I had no soul for roast duck seasoning. There are several ducks - the paradise duck is commonest. ... Then there are the grey duck and the mountain duck - rarer, less striking in their personal appearance, and better eating.
