Quote:  Effect a few improvements in the Town,/ And get the gratings properly laid down./ Not in that curous gridiron style,/ To catch the heels of every poor file -/ <i>Ibid.</i>13 The Tay-street gridirons are a vile delusion and a snare./ Dee-street as yet with gratings I observe is not supplied.
