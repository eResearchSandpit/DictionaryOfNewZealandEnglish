Quote:  Presently we may emerge from the forest upon some moor-like tableland in the heart of the ranges, where we again meet with a characteristic flora composed largely of heath-like Gaultherias, white gentians, blue ground-lilies, yellow forget-me-nots  [fn <i>Myosotis australis</i>], native daisies [fn <i>Brachycome Sinclairii</i>], creeping veronicas, and white-flowered Pimeleas, with magnificent clumps of the larger Spaniard.
