Notes: ca1951 May 17 Feilding Freezing Works terms p.c. Colin Gordon The carcases are washed and wiped by a wiper, then a stringer, generally a boy, puts strings on the front legs and necks, and they go over to  the clock which counts them. The carcases then go to the pusher-up who pushes them along to the scales to be weighed and graded. A  stamper stamps the carcases and a  ticket-boy puts a grade ticket on them out at the scales after the  grader has graded them for weight and size.
