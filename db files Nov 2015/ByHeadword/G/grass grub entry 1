Quote:  The depredations of the subterranean grass caterpillar [<i>Oxycanus </i>sp.] in the rye-grass and clover pastures, particularly in ... the east coast of the South Island, have been recognized for some years as demanding control measures. The damage ... is probably only second in importance to that done by the true `grass grub,' <i>Odontria zealandica</i>. Until recently, practically all damage done to pasture was attributed to <i>Odontria</i>, [310] and only recently have farmers commenced to distinguish between the two pests, and to refer to [<i>Oxycanus</i>] as `grass caterpillar,' or `<i>Porina</i> caterpillar.' It is unfortunate that the generic name <i>Porina</i>, which was coming into general use, must now  be changed to <i>Oxycanus</i>, since the name <i>Porina</i> is preoccupied as a molluscan genus.
