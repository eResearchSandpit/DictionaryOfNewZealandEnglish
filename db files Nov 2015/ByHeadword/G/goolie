Quote:  BRUCE BYRNE 54. An Australian from Nhill in Victoria and resident locally for about 15 years. Worked for Greytown Borough Council. `I w's scared at first, diggin' graves. Now I lie in 'em for size!' Introduced a new word into the District - `Goulie' for the large stones that abound in the local soil.  [M. Burton's note for H.NZDQ (May 1984)] `The word `goulie' was a colloquialism in Nhill and is now common among council workers in Greytown.'
