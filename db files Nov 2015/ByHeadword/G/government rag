Quote:  Shinplasters.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,'  vide `The Australian,' 19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650  The Numismatist, 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to
facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.'

Quote:  The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as  `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past.  Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.
