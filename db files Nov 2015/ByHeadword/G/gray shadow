Quote:  Travelling from Wellington on the little coaster ... they made a good trip through the ... Pelorus Sound, where sported the playful gray fish `Pelorus Jack' (science often disputed whether he was a porpoise or his exact species). ... [155] For years this famous fish continued ..., and was the only fish in the world protected by Act of Parliament. Eventually the famous `Gray Shadow' disappeared, and the Dominion mourned his loss.
