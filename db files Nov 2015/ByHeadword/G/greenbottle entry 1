Quote:   Blue drew himself up to his full five feet four and took a long, reflective swallow of beer. `Oh, the ones we've got left now aren't too bad. We got shot of all greenbottles earlier [in the Watersiders Union after the 1951 lockout] in the piece. Took a bit of working though. We blokes from the old union had to play it quiet for a while when they let us back on the wharf. And man, were we glad to get back.' <i>Ibid.</i> 82 `WHAT IS A GREENBOTTLE THEN?' I ask ... `Don't know can rightly give you a winning ticket on that one, `said Charley. Sort of like a blue bottle trying to fly on one wing. As Bill, he'll put you right;' Bill blew on his tea while he considered. `Our Clanger's a greenbottle sometimes - and then again sometimes he's not. Come to think of it most people down here act like bottles now and then. Except me of course. Tell what, ask Curly. He's a bit of an intellectual.' For the fourth time I repeated my question. But Curly just smiled and said, `You'll learn, boy. Take a look in
the mirror for the starter ...' .
