Quote:  G.E.J.: Can any `Kia Ora Coo-ee-ite' dig up anything to beat this for the pure and unadulterated? A certain New Zealand Regiment, camped on the Jordan flats, recently came under the eagle eye of brother `Jacko', who immediately went `butcher's hook' or `ram's horn' and launched forth much frightfulness by lugging a 5.9 up on to one of the spare hills and chucking ironmongery promiscuously about the landscape.
