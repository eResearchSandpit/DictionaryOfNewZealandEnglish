Quote:  Speaking of the Moonlight Ranges (Taringatura) he [Mr Roberts] says: - `The snowgrass was very rank and in flower, a greenish white, like rye grass. The speargrass was a great nuisance. There was a large celmesia, or cotton plant, growing very abundantly, the leaves long and narrow with a soft down on the under part of the leaf and a white flower like a large moon daisy.'

<i>Ibid.</i>  23 July 6. - I set out on foot ... and the long wet snowgrass soaked me to the waist. I crossed a swamp jumping from one Maori-head to another, but some were too weak to carry me, so I frequently slipped down into the mud, ... <i>Ibid.</i> Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote:  Snowgrass, Snow tussock.- <i> Danthonia [flavescens] </i>and <i>D. [rubra]</i>.) There are two kinds but shepherds do not distinguish between them. In Southland the kind they have there looks redder and is called locally <i>red tussock</i>. Sheep do not care for it, but it is so big that it sticks out of snow well and gives them a nibble. (C.)   `The grass is coarse and cold-looking--great tufts of what is called snowgrass ... [which] grows in a clump sometimes five or six feet in diameter and four or five feet high; sheep and cattle pick at it when they are hungry, but seldom touch it while they can get anything else. Its seed is like that of oats. It is an unhappy-looking grass, if grass it be.'`[Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],pp.74-5.
