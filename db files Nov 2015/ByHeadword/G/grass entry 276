Quote:  SOFT BROME (<i>Bromus mollis</i>). In common with several other weeds this is familiarly called goose grass, a name which on account of the confusion engendered by its use, had better be entirely dropped. It is also mistakenly called barley grass. It occurs in pastures and waste places in nearly every locality.
