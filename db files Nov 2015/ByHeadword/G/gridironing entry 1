Quote:  The system of gridironing in the early days was a practice largely followed by purchasers of land. Strips of land were taken up which made it impossible for an outsider to come in between, thus enabling as man to hold a larger area of country than at the time he could pay for.

Quote:  Gridironing ... a term used in the province of Canterbury, New Zealand. A man purchased land in the shape of a gridiron, knowing that nobody would take the intermediate strips, which later he could purchase at his leisure. In other provinces free-selection (q.v.) was only allowed after survey.

Quote:  It was thought that the free-trade foolishness had died in New Zealand; that it had been buried with plural voting, the public soup kitchen, the conservative property tax, land gridironing, and other swindles and unpleasantnesses.

Quote:  Some of the runholders now thought of two new devices to preserve their estates. The first consisted of buying a series of 20 acre sections fronting on a road, [123] so spaced as to leave between them sections of 19 acres. Under the Waste Lands Regulations, none of less than 20 acres could be bought except by having it put up to auction. Few people would go to the trouble of having this done; and anyone who did was in all probability a man of small means, who stood little chance of outbidding the runholder. It usually happened, therefore, that all these 19-acre sections were retained without having to be purchased. This was known as `gridironing.'

Quote:  When investigating the change from pastoral lease to freehold in any locality, the student, brought up on Pember Reeves (see e.g. S.E.I. [State Experiments 1902] 234) searches immediately for evidences of the methods by which the runholder retained his grasp of the land. These practices called gridironing and spotting can be defended: there is no need to do so here. If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it.

Quote:   `Gridironing' was the practice of buying twenty acre sections fronting on a road, so spaced as to leave sections of 19 acres between them, and as these had to be auctioned the small farmer stood little chance of out bidding the runholder who usually retained them without having to purchase them. `Spotting' was buying up key positions, fertile land, and leaving the barren, water courses, entrances to valleys, road lines ...

Quote:  Where land was auctioned the system known as `grid-ironing' was useful: the leaseholder would buy a series of sections each of, say, twenty acres along a frontage, leaving perhaps eighteen acres between sections. Since no one but a poor man would want so small an area, the leaseholder could count on outbidding any rival.

Quote:  The runholder was protected against intruders: cottages, fences and homesteads gave him a pre-emptive right over a set number of contiguous acres. Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land - Sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years.

Quote:  A [112] powerful landowner ... had for years dominated the Haast Valley and his cattle wandered and grazed rent-free over the lush valleys and river flats - rent-free because he had leased all the access. This practice, called grid-ironing, was not uncommon and was undertaken by numerous big landowners.
