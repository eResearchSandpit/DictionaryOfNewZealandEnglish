Notes: 17  /  10  /   2004  Sunday (Sunday Star Times Magazine  Page 8) What is guerilla shopping? It's a strategic, premeditated way to shop for people who hate carparks, crowds and fluorescent lights, but find themselves in need of consumer goods. The aim is to get in, get the loot and get out quickly.
