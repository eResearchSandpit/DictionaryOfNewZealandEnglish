Quote:  Then there is the gateway effect... This leads them to smoke more and eventually leads them to the point where marijuana just doesn't do anything for them anymore, so they have to move through the gateway onto hard drugs...To apply the "logic" of the "gateway effect" one would have to concede that if you have a cup of coffee then you will inevitably go on to drink alcohol, smoke cannabis and end up on the P.
