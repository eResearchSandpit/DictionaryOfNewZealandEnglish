Quote:  When the business's part-owner went to sort that out, the grievant, who was standing by the door, alledgedly hassled and grabbed him... Here, an investigation meeting took place but it was unusual in that it proceeded without the grievant or her representative being present... The lessons to be learnt from these two cases involving drinking grievants is that, except in truly exceptional circumstances, a proper investigation must be carried out before an individal is dismissed.

Quote:  The Employment Tribunal, and the Employment Court on appeal, upheld their claims and awarded between three and six momnths pay for reasonable notice and $11,000 to $15,000 compensation for humiliation and distress to each grievant... As regards compensation for humilation aqnjd distress, the Court of Appeal held that the awards made to the grievants failed to distinguish between the impact of not having a job and that of the manner in which the terminations of employment were implemented... "After exercising the element of job loss, we consider that [an award] of $7000 to each [grievent] would have been appropriate," the Court of Appeal said.
