Quote:  There were over a thousand diggers ... waiting to see the result of the prospect when we bottomed. We ... struck very good gold ... We built a paddock, rigged up a windlass, and got several very good washings out of this shaft ... <i>Ibid.</i> 64 There was no ground to be got there. ... There was good gold there, but the claims were all taken up. <i>Ibid.</i> 142 From there [Molyneux] I went to Gabriel's Gully, where I opened a claim and got good gold. '
