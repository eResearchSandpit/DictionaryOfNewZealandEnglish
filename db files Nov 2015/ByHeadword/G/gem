Quote:  The outstanding favourite is the gem, ginger-flavoured; as for its specialised container, the gem-iron (unknown to any dictionary I have consulted, including my own production), I can now report that there are sufficient gem-irons in our kitchens to provide the navy with the makings of the hull of the frigate they are looking for... These gem-irons are not for scrap.
