Quote:  For half an hour, Paul Holmes swung his rhetorical cudgels on behalf of New Zealand's reluctant godwits... The mums and dads of the godwits (or as Tony Simpson prefers to call them, the "halfwits") can shake their heads sadly over their gin and tonics and intone indignantly upon the destructive effects "this government's policies" are having on the future of the nation.
