Quote:  It is gone now, replaced by a modern Welling Tin ... The Bank of New Zealand building, a black glass giant known colloquially as Darth Vader's Pencil Case, is monumental both to old unionism and public/private enterprise. ... You can also see the 'Govermnment Village", a piquant name: stone Parliament; recently restored, old massive, wooden Government Buildings...; and new plastic Beehive.
