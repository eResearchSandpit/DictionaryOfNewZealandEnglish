Quote:  The <i>Fringillidae </i>, or Finch family, has two species; one of them, the Kataitai or ground-lark, is the most numerous bird in the country. It rarely sings unless its nest is approached, when it rises in the air a short distance and sings, evidently for the purpose of drawing off the danger.
