Quote:  At the Speight's brewery in Otago, magnificent kauri gyles - or vats - made for Speight's by coopers in 1945 were dusted off after 30 years in storage to create a range of Porter and a new

Pilsener, Pale Ale and a brew dubbed Distinction Ale. It's one of only two breweries in the world to use a wooden gyle - the other is in England.
