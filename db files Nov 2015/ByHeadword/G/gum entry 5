Quote:  If [the gum] is perfectly cleaned and of good quality, [the digger] sells it as `rescraped' or `first-class gum', the proportionate value of which is nearly double that of ordinary - that is, `half-scraped'. Then there is `three-quarter scraped]', a quality and value intermediate; `inferior ordinary' and `washed nuts' completing the list, be the gum white, black or bush.

Quote:  The terms dust, seeds, chips, nubs, & c. are the names given to certain of the lower kauri gum grades according to the relative sizes of the pieces. From `dust' the size of the fraqments increases in the order given, as does also the purity of the grade. Chalk, or `chalky gum,' is a particular grade recovered from swampy country and is characterized by its white or chalky appearance and large water content.
