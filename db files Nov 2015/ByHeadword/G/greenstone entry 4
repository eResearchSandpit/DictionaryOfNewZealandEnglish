Quote:  The greenstone trails that penetrated the wild mountain backbone of the South Island ... were the routeways for the precious pounamu that was carried to all corners of the land ... the arteries for the lifeblood of a people who depended on finely worked stone for their survival... [23] Poaching greenstone is as much a tradition for West Coasters as owning it is for Ngai Tahu... The greenstone is in places so high, so wild, so remote that helicopters are the only way of getting it out in any quantity.
