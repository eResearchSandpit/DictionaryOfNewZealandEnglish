Quote:  I took that to mean, if you're driving your high-performance Australian sedan around in commuter traffic, you are unlikely to get 'green-stickered'... If a vehicle's exhaust is louder than the original fitted by the manufacturer, the vehicle can be 'green-stickered' by Police, indicating that it requires a new Warrant of Fitness.
