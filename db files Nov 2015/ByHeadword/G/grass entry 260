Quote:  <i>Blue-grass.- ([Agropyrum scabrum]</i>) A beautiful grass [blue wheat grass] on which horses are said to have worked as well as on oats. It was supposed to have been pretty well eaten out of any accessible place in the first 25 years of the settlement, though Professor Wall tells me it is still abundant if you know where to look for it.
