Quote:  [Hdg] Te Papa displays colossus squid. Wellingtonians can now see one of the deep sea's most elusive and rare creatures, a colossus squid, at Te Papa. Regarded as the biggest and most aggressive of the giant squid species, it will be displayed for two weeks before being returned to the non-display collection.... Te Papa mollusc collection curator Bruce Marshall said many people would never have another chance to see the colossus. It has rows of swivelling hooks on the tips of its tentacles and reputedly has the biggest eyes in the animal kingdom.

Quote:  I had an unforgettable sighting in 1963 while we were living at Puyseger Point Lighthouse Station in Fiordland. Two or there hours before a major storm hit I watched with binoculars for about 10 minutes the amazing sight of a huge sperm whale (estimated length 60 ft) leaping, time and again, almost completely airborne with his body surrounded by the tentacles of a giant squid. The tentacles appered to me to be almost as long as the whale, though possibly my memory tricks me.
