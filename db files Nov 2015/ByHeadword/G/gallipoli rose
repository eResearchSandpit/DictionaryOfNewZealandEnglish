Quote:  Soldiers who survived the battle at Gallipoli in World War I came home with seeds of a little bush growing wild there that covered itself in rose-like flowers. They called it the Gallipoli rose... The plant's real name is <i>cistus</i>, covering about 20 evergreen species native to dry, stony soils throughout the Mediterranean. Common names include rock rose and sun rose. Another common name is gum cistus because the leaves of some species are sticky to the touch.
