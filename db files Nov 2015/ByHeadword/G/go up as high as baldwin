Quote:  All countries have their slang expressions, and New Zealand is no exception to the rule. `To go up for a skate' is one colonial idiom, and `To go up as high as [index to common names 283-293], baldfish 598-90 ' is another. Both colloquialisms are similar in meaning, but `To go up as high as Baldwin' had its origin in the 90's, after a visit to this country of the balloonist, Professor Baldwin. <i>Ibid.</i> 68 ... Poor Captain Lorraine [a balloonist killed in an accident]. He met with disaster. To use a colloqual expression `He went up as high as Baldwin'.
Notes:  [c1890's]
