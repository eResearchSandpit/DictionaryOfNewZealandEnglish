Quote:  New Zealand trade commissioner Don MacLean.. said millions of dollars of seafood, mainly live crayfish, was smuggled in to China from Hong Kong annually, using so-called grey channels to avoid tariffs of up to 15 per cent.... The unofficial trade between Hong Kong and China, through the "grey channel", was increasing.
