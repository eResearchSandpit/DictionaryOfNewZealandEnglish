Quote:  Some months ago I wrote the `Lone Hand' I would not renew my subscription if they published fraud advertisements, and specified Kugalman's soap and a hair restorer. They replied, in the `Bulletin', that both articles were good, and said I would not use them because I was `incurably bald and hopelessly unclean.' Now see me get home on them.

Quote:  Queen Mary objects to cigarette smoking by women, and, whilst a recent quest in a country house, got home nicely on two up-to-date dames who had smoked cigarettes in her presence

without asking her permission ... On this occasion, after dinner, Mary stood up and knitted for a solid hour, until the cigarette smokers, pleading fatigue retired to bed.
