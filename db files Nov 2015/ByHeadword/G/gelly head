Quote:  The miners [at Martha Mine c1907] often suffered from severe headaches, known as [5] `gelly heads', caused by the fumes from blasting in confined spaces and from handling the `gelly'. ... If [the nitro-glycerine] came into contact with the miners' hands, and they then wiped the sweat from their foreheads, they would get a terrible headache.
