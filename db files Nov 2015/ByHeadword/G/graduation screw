Quote:  A tax of a penny in the pound was levied on the unimproved value of all landed properties over 500 [pounds] in value; holdings worth over 5,000 [pounds] paid a graduated tax commencing at an eight of a penny in the pound ... The Government hoped that `the graduation screw', as the landowners called the tax, would `burst up' the estates by making it costly to retain large, undeveloped properties.
