Quote:  GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI)  <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South
Islanders as Spotty  (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen.

Quote:  It is unfortunate that the Butterfish [<i>Corridodax pullus</i>] has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish ... <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish <i>Corridodax pullus</i> Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish ...

Quote:  Parochialism runs strong in most of us, and many will note indignantly the absence of a familiar local name. The difficulty is that Stewart Island butterfish = Wellington spotty, while Wellington butterfish = Stewart Island greenbone. <i>Ibid.</i> 224  Family SCARIDAE includes <i>Odax vittatus</i>, one of many kinds of `kelp fish', and the greenbone (if I may use its apt southern name),  otherwise <i>Corridodax pullus</i> ... , a handsome fish with its long graceful fins.

Quote:  Tuamarina:  for at  east 20 years, the usual term used by Picton fishermen for what are usually in Wellington called `butterfish'. What G.R. would normally term `butterfish' is a fish like a large spottie (=? KELPFISH). (A `kelpie' is something quite different again)

Quote:  BUTTERFISH (Greenbone, marari) <i>Odax pullus  (Coridodax pullus, Odax vittatus)</i> ... Small individuals have a markedly different colour pattern from that of the adults and until recently were thought to belong to a separate species named the  kelpfish, [266] <i>Odax vittatus</i>. These young fish are yellow-brown with a line of white dashes running down each side ... [Butterfish] are an excellent eating fish, with delicate tasty flesh that prompted the name butterfish ...
