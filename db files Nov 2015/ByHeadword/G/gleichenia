Quote:  The Gleichenias [51] are a very distinct kind, with their ladder-like fronds set in umbrella shape. Hymenophyllums, or filmy Ferns, are very curious. Adiantums, or Maiden-hairs, are in infinite variety. The Todeas are very beautiful, especially <i> Todea superba</i>, which is commonly called Prince of Wales' Feather.
