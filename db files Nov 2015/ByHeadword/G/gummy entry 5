Quote:  <i>Mustelus antarcticus</i>. Synonyms: <i>Galeus antarcticus</i> and <i>Galeorhinus antarcticus</i>. The smooth-hound, or gummy (<i>Mustelus antarcticus</i>) ... is one of the small sharks commonly taken by trawlers around new Zealand, and popularly termed `dogfish.' The family is distinguished by the blunt pavement-like teeth - hence the popular name `gummy,' in use in Australia, where the species is also common.
