Quote:  For its size the kauri has little leaf fall, and with nothing going back into the ground it takes heavy toll of the country. It seems that the kauri gum, which over the years or centuries has

permeated the soil, has also had an adverse effect on fertility. Another theory is that in this high-rainfall country excessive leaching of the denuded areas has done considerable harm.

Whatever the causes this burnt kauri country - known as `gum country' - was considered to be of little value.
