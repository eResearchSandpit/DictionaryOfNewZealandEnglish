Quote:  Petrol heads, bogans, and gruffs - these names mean one thing to west Auckland comedian Ewen Gilmour : "westies". Gilmour believes westies live all over the country. No matter where they live they share a love of tight black jeans, the smell of burning rubber and the feel of a leather jacket. Being a westie is about lifestyle, not location.

Quote:  In Auckland we're Westies, but in Wellington they're called Bogans, in Christchurch Gruffs and in Wainuiomata they're called locals.
