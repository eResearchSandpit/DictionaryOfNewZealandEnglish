Quote:  Totokepio is the `little diver' of the settler to distinguish it from the `big diver' (the crested grebe). The Canterbury compiler spells it as given, but in Southland the name is Totokipio, and if taken in sections To-toki-pio it is easy to pronounce. The kamana or crested grebe is not mentioned.
