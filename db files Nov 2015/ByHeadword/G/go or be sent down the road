Quote:  To be sent down the road .... Expressions heard used in Central Otago and Fiord country Otago, by people engaged in gold-mining or bush work. In the beginning, I should imagine, it was a literal description of what happened to the man - since there was only one road leading out of the community ... It is now used in isolated communities to describe someone being dismissed, even if he can get another job that keeps him in the community.

Quote:  boot: can be used for the things you hike in, and there is an expression `to put the boot in' which means metaphorically to kick someone, as `then he really put the boot in and sent him down the road' (fired him); or gave him the boot. However, the commonest use of boot refers to what you would call the TRUNK of your car. <i>Ibid.</i> 89 sent down the road: To be relieved of the necessity of returning to your place of employment as a result of involuntary separation from your employer. FIRED.
