Quote:  [Allom made the note when he borrowed the MS from Jollie's wife, and made this comment on Jollie's account of buying the best parts out of a run in 1856] This was probably about the beginning of the grid-iron process of picking the eyes out of the country, so much practised afterwards.

Such methods were partially justified by the runholders' insecurity of tenure.
