Quote:  The word `gorge' hardly defines it. It is really a valley with most precipitous sides .... The road is what is called a bluff road, that is, it is cut out of the side of the precipice.

Quote:  Gorge.-A correspondent has been good enough to remind me of a usage of this word which I believe is peculiar to Canterbury: i.e., any main valley above the (technically correct)

g. of a river. For instance, musterers always speak of Hakatere, Mespotamia, Manuka Point, Lake Heron, etc., etc., as being in the Ashburton, Rakaia or Rangitata  G. This usage goes back to at least 1894. As my correspondent says, `misty gorges are particularly prevalent in the MacKenzie Country'; so I suppose the usage will become poetical.
