Quote:  Winstone Wallboards Limited is the owner of a number of registered trademarks including the word GIB(R), which is often incorrectly used as an alternative to the word plasterboard or drywall as a verb or proper noun. Examples of incorrect uses of the word GIB(R) would be, "gib stopper, gibbing, gib stopping, or gib plastering." In these examples the correct term would be "plasterboard stopper, plastering, plasterboard stopping or plasterboard plastering".
