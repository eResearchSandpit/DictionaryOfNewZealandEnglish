Notes: Jane Godfrey notes that Truth (1910 first half of year) tells about a kid in Hastings yelling out to mark Twain during his visit (and who had just died about the time of Truth's article) `Get your hair cut'. Twain immediately made for the nearest barber's and obliged. (Truth says the story is apocryphal.)
