Quote:  GLOBE-FISH <i>Contusus richei </i>(Freminville) ... It has several other popular names such as Balloon-fish and Mouse-fish. In America it is known as Rabbit-fish and Stink-fish. The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. The names Globe-fish and Balloon-fish were given because of the animal's habit of inflating itself with air to such an extent that the body was like a lamp globe or an inflated balloon. The Mouse-fish is the most popular among some fishermen and when the fish is distended it does present a striking resemblance to a mouse, with its cunning looking face. The name Rabbit-fish in America is so given because its teeth are like those of a rabbit. The most witty name, Publican-fish given to it by Australian fishermen, is said to have originated from the resemblance of an inflated Globe-fish to the rotundity of many successful publicans.
