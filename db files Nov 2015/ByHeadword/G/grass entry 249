Quote:  So to cope with the rituals of tramping, its pains and camaraderie, a slang language has developed to suit. Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.
