Quote:  We've had the Great Helmsman. Now we've got the Great Debater.It's the latest moniker attached to Opposition leader Don Brash who started his leadership as "24/7" - an ironic reference to his inaccessibility after promising reporters he would field calls at all hours of the day and night. The Great Debater is not meant any more kindly. It's Winston Peters' latest stratagem to call attention to Dr Brash's absences from Parliament.
