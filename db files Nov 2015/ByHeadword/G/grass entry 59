Quote:  On the mountains of both islands the WIRY DANTHONIA  (<i>D. setifolia</i>), so called because of the stiff, erect, acicular leaves, is the commoner species over wide areas. In Marlborough it is sometimes termed the NEEDLE GRASS, a name that is also and more aptly applied to a smaller cushion-forming plant of limestone country in the north of the South Island known as <i>Poa acicularifolia. </i>
