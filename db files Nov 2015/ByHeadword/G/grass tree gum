Notes: [JD notes: Curious. Seems to refer to cabbage tree which doesn't exude gum. Only tree that really does is kauri. HWO: could this be a confusion of the neinei `grass-tree' growing on kauri, with kauri gum also found in crotches of kauri trees and phs associated with neinei.??]

Quote:  Some friends ... have written us to send them from New Zealand two or three tons of `Grass Tree Gum' (or Gum <i>Acroides</i>). This gum ... is said to grow in quantities in New Zealand. ... The Grass Tree, we believe, chiefly grows in low swampy places; and may be known by its peculiar stumpy stem covered with a kind of grass. When cut ... the gum exudes plentifully; and ... it has an aromatic quality. ... we may - provided a regular supply can be insured - soon see New Zealand Grass Tree Gum commanding a good quotation in the London Price Lists.
