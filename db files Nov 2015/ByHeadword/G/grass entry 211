Quote:  Like the narrow plains of the Waikauroa, it grows only the wiry tree grass or something [225] similar, and <i>Phormium tenax</i>, no aniseed, perennial groundsel, or milk thistle, and very little couchgrass, ...  the prevailing species of trees are remo [rimu], totara, and tall manuka, all indicative of inferior soil.... The bush-like woods on the east side are of white birch, likewise no recommendation of the soil, but the chief objection to the district is, that the prairie soil affords scarcely any food for cattle ... it grows only the wiry tree grass [tussock] ... and <i>Phormium tenax</i> [flax], no aniseed, perennial groundsel, or milk thistle, and very little couch grass.

Quote:  The name `couch' is often applied to any grass that spreads by means of underground rhizomes, but the following species are the ones that are most frequently termed `couch-grass': (1) Smooth-stalked meadow grass or Kentucky blue-grass  (<i>Poa pratensis</i>); (2) fiorin (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>); (3)  twitch (<i>Agropyron repens</i>); (4) Indian doob-grass (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>); (5) buffalo-grass (<i>Stenotaphrum glabrum</i>). As the term `couch-grass' is a general one, it is better not to apply it to any single species.
