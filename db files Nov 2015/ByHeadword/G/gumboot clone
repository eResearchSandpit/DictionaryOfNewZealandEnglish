Quote:  I'd always meant to have a yarn to Willie about the 'gumboot' or 'Abel' clone and foolishly kept putting it off. The gumboot clone (a clone in this case is simply a vine cutting) was so called because it was discovered inside the gumboot of a returning Kiwi by a customs officer at Auckland airport. It is seen as important to have a mixture of different clones to make great pinot and Ata Rangi owes about a third of its content to the gumboot clone.
