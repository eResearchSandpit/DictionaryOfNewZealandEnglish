Quote:  In 1908 [Cosgrove] was instrumental in setting up the Girl Peace Scouts, an equivalent to Scouts for girls... With this background, Cosgrove would appear to be arranging for a joint meeting between Woodend or Rangiora Girl Peace Scouts and the Peace Scouts of East Belt methodist, sometime during or after 1908.

Quote:  In 1909 Colonel Cosgrove, a New Zealander who had fought in the Boer War and had there met Sir Baden-Powell, as he was then known, and had talked with him about his ideas on Scouting, thought that the girls of New Zealand should have some Movement of their own. Scouting had already found its way to New Zealand, but there was no talk of Guiding for girls. So Colonel Cosgrove called his Movement "The Girl Peace Scouts"... The girls wore khaki dresses, which were very long, but no one seemed to mind. They had hats which turned up at the sides, carried staves on all occasions, and they always had a bugler! Troop flags and haversacks were also part of the uniform. The girls did not believe in anything too tame, and had fearsome emblems such as curlews, moreporks, and peewits for their patrols. The knots were three pieces of ribbon tied in bows, to remind the girls of their threefold promise. The enrolment badge was very similar to the Girl Guide badge of to-day, with the letters P.S. (peace scout) on it... In October 1923 came official word that the Girl Guides' Association of New Zealand.. had been duly registered in London with Imperial  headquarters.
