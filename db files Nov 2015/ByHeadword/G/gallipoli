Quote:  [cp ANZAC] We thought [Cape Helles] was going to be something of a holiday from the Anzac sector. By then, well into May, I was no longer elated about war, especially Gallipolli. <i>Ibid.</i> 97  ... a sickening sideshow of World War I which is remembered, where recalled elsewhere at all, under the name of Gallipoli. For many New Zealanders, though, Gallipoli has remained as potent a placename as any in the outside world, a name as familiar as Taupo or Timaru, but one which chills the heart.
