Quote:  There were not the same opportunities here, so the class of wayfarers so frequently known as sundowners in Australia were always called swaggers in Otago. These `gentlemen of the swag' were not in evidence until after the gold diggings broke out, and after that time they seemed to call more at farmhouses than at the big stations, which were more out of the way.
