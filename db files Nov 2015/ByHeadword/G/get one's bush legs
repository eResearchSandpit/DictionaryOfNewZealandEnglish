Quote:  The recruits from Wellington know nothing of the bush ...They were falling over logs and vines; a man needs to get his bush-legs just as a sea passenger needs to get [211] his sea-legs; he must learn where to place his feet andhow to get through the bush with the greatest speed and the least trouble.
