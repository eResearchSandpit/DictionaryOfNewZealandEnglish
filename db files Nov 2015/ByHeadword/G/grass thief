Quote:  All told there were from 1,500 to 2,00 strangers each year, some 500 to 800 of those belonging to one or two men in the back country known to be 'grass thieves,' that is men who deliberately turned sheep out on to blocks of our country ..The grass thieves thought we were hard on them, but after the Station disposed of the blocks adjoining them, they found our successors were far more severe, and this sort of thing quickly came to an end.
