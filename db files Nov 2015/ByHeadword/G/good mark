Notes: 1845. R. Howitt, `Australian,' `I wondered often what was the meaning of this, amongst many other peculiar colonial phrases, `Is the man a good mark?' I heard it casually from the lips of apparently respectable setters, as they rode on the highways, `Such and such a one is a good mark,' simply a person who pays his men their wages, without delays or draw-backs; a man to whom you may sell anything safely; for there are in the colony people who are regularly summoned before the magistrates by every servant they employ for wages. They seem to like to do everything publicly, legally, and so become notoriously not `good marks.'' ca1941 He's OK. A good mark up to about 50 quid ca1949 You're lucky to get him for the job. He's a good mark.
