Quote:  The sober-sided settler .... hardly even has a good word for him; `He's only a gumdigger', is an expression I have commonly heard used, to imply that the individual indicated was a person of no importance. The title `gumdigger' itself may have something to do with the matter. It is not a nice word, and looks too much like `gravedigger' at first sight
