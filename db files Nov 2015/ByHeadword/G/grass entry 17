Quote:  Allom `Stockfarming in the Wairarapa' [The porcupine grass] when young, is devoured by sheep with avidity, and the root is a favorite and agreeable food both with natives and stockmen. But when the grass is fully grown ... the stems .... closely resemble the quills of the porcupine and are pretty nearly as formidable to the legs of the stockmen. Porcupine grass is abundant in the Wairarapa.

When young, it is devoured by sheep ... and the root is a favourite and agreeable food both with natives and stockmen. But [127] when this grass is fully grown, ... the stems, as its name implies, closely resemble the quills of a porcupine, and are pretty nearly as formidable to the legs of the stockmen. ... is abundant in the Wairarapa ... cf.
