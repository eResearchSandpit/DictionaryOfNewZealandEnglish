Quote:  Milford Haven [west coast sounds] is a wild romantic looking place, ... the woods are abundantly supplied with game, as woodhens, green birds, emus etc - these birds are of large size, they lay their eggs in holes in the ground ... and as they cannot fly, they are easily overtaken with dogs.

<i>Ibid.</i> 104  The birds are not  remarkably musical - the linnets are rather so; The Bell-Bird, is of a purple colour, with a white spot on the breast, shaped like a bell. The Saddle back, is a brown bird with a bright red spot on its back like a saddle, these two last species, are about the size of a thrush. There are green parroquets, large hawks, and several kinds of wild ducks, besides Emus, greenbirds and woodhens, which are birds of excellent flavour.

Quote:  Near the mouth of the Middle Fiord [of Te Anau], they picked up a stone tomahawk and shot a `native emu'. The bird is described as being `curious among the feathered tribe, having neither wings nor tail'. Caples goes on to say that `Other night-loving birds, such as the keewee and green-bird promenaded around our camp all night.' ... [104] However I favour the conclusion

that their `native emu' was the large type of kiwi (roa).
