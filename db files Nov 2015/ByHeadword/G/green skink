Quote:  'So for the extensive survey, we're using a basic method of counting how many lizards are captured in a 24-hour period. It's a quick index of population size for species such as common skinks and McCann's skinks and common (brown) geckos. Unfortunately we're unlikely to detect less abundant species such as green skinks, cryptic skinks or jewelled geckos.'

Quote:  Fruit is an important element in the diet of many skinks... Like a bird, this green skink will help disperse the seeds of the <i>Melicytus</i> bush in which it is feeding. An inhabitant of Otago, Southland and Stewart Island, the green skink frequents tussock, scrub, boulder fields and areas of coastal vegetation.
