Quote:  `Work' is `graft'; salary, or wage is `screw'; `rubbers' are named `goloshes'; a silk-hat is a `bell-topper'. `Lollies' is the colonial term for confectionery etc ... `Coo-ee' (prolonged) is used as a long-distance call, instead of `hello'. In ringing up a telephone, instead of `Hello, central,' people here ask, `Are you there' or `Is that exchange' - Then give the number required as in London `shouting means treating'. Being `had' is a term used here when a person feels he has been imposed upon or cheated.
