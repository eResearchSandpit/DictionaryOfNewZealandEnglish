Quote:  We shook these in the water and chased the fish downstream. In this way we caught hosts of `creekies' (minnows) and bullies and sometimes enough whitebait for a fritter each for tea. As well, we went fishing for `guffy' from the rocks. Often we caught a crayfish and at low tide sometimes several. ... (1890; Akaroa)

Quote:  SPOTTY (PAEKIRIKIRI) <i>Pseudolabrus (Lunolabrus) celidotus</i>  (Bloch and Schneider) ... [<i>ibid.</i> 275] The name Spotty is derived from the presence of spots on each side of the fish. The name Butterfish used in the North Island for them is from the yellow or buttery colouring on the undersurface. In Canterbury they are called Guffy, but for what reason I have yet to learn. It is a very pretty fish, more especially when seen in the water.
