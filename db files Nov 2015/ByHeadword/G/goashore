Quote:  T'souduckey [on Tuki's chart] A three-legged iron pot for boiling. The word is probably a re-formation of Maori  koohua, attracted to the forms of English collocations go-ashore etc. The phonology of koohua > go(a)shore can be explained: Maori /k/ perceived as a [g] realisation Maori /o:/ perceived as a [ou]  Maori /h/ realised in tribal dialect as [ ] and perceived as  /ua/ perceived as  See the spelling goahore, an intermediate form.

Quote:  The Natives now begin to use Iron pots, known to them by the name of, `Go on Shores,' from the circumstance of Boats going up and down the Rivers, coming to an Anchor and going on Shore to Cook, but the Natives prefer the Old plan [sc coppre Mouries, hangis] and I think they are right.  [fn ed.] Elsewhere Markham uses the more usual `go ashore', probably a corruption of the Maori `kohua', a vessel for boiling food by means of heated stones. <i>Ibid.</i> 57 We went to Showracky to get some more `Go ashores' or Iron pots, for Household purposes, tin pannikins to drink out of.

Quote:  note [reference to arbitrary names given people by the Maoris].  The New Zealanders, for example, observing that the sailors on board the whaling vessels that touched at their ports uniformly carried an iron pot with them to cook their provisions when they went on shore, conceived the words Go ashore, which they were accustomed to hear when preparations were making for landing, was the proper name for an iron pot and they have accordingly been adopted as such in the New Zealand [Maori] language.

Quote:  Go-ashore: This [common utensil] was a round kettle-like pot of considerable dimensions with legs like a camp oven and with a handle to enable it to be hung over the fire. This was commonly called a `go-ashore'. Just how it got its name is not quite clear but the accepted explanation is as follows:- Early in the `white' history of New Zealand, some Maoris were anxious to know the name of the utensil. The white man addressed was not so much concerned about the enquiry as about landing, so instructed his companies to `go ashore'. Mistaking the instruction for an answer to their question the Maoris applied the name `goashore' to this particular kind of kettle. Whatever the origin of the name, the `go-ashore' was a valued part of the early settlers' equipment.
