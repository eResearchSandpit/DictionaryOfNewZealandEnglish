Quote:  Auckland University professor of psychology Graham Vaughan suggests that speed dating is perhaps a recycled idea from back in the days of Gay Gordons dances. "The pattern is the same," he says. "It's a very simple one. Everyone is up on the dance floor with a partner, you did a bit of a jig together for 30 second or so, then you all change partners in sequence, until you hopefully get all the way around the hall."
