Quote:  GALLIPOLI DAY [title] The keeping of Gallipoli Day, originally called Anzac Day, is now an institution on Cairo. It was instituted by the Anzacs, but there were other heroes besides the Australian and New Zealand troops on Gallipoli; and it is in memory of all who fell on the spot, or who were later carried, after terrible sufferings, to their last resting place in Old Cairo, that we now keep the Day.
