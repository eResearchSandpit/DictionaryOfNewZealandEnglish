Quote:  The second digester has observation glasses which allow the operator to see when it is full of whale oil and glax. (Glax is the cooked meat and bones and the water.) When it gets to a certain level, the whale oil is blown into a pre-heat tank and the gluewater at the bottom of the digester is blown away.
