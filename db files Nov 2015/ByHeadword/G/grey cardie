Quote:  There's no knowing what a knee is capable of and the doings of a breast are terrifying to contemplate. But when you combine them with large dangly earrings, you're in territory where a grey cardie would just have to close his eyes, hold his breath, and pray to the god of grey cardies... Prebble solemnly explained, as a grey cardie would, how he knew the score. He knew that earrings are a trouser-tease; he'd seen her little game; she wouldn't be lifting his cardie as easily as all <i>that</i>.
