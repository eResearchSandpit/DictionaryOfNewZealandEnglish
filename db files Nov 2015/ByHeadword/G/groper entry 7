The first on the list of marketable fishes is the hapuku, or whapuku of the Maoris (<i>Hectoria gigas</i> of Count Castelnau), or habuka, as the name is generally pronounced by Europeans, who in the south, apply the name groper to the same fish. It is also occasionally called the cod-fish, which is altogether erroneous, as it is more properly the representative of the sea-perch of European seas.
