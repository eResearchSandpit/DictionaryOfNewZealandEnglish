Quote:  Too exhausted to don sodden gear and face yet another four hours in ice-cold rain, I girl-out on a stored sail and skip a watch, leaving the fleet-footed and seemingly fearless sailors to steer us expertly through the worst of the night, and re-emerge as Auckland comes into view on Tuesday morning.
