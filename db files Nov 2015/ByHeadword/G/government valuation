Quote:  'What's the GV?' is the first question most buyers ask when they're in the market for a new house. Actually, as of 1998 there is no such thing. The job of valuing properties moved out of the government arena three years ago. The valuation of properties became contestable, and the former Government  Valuation Department became a business called Quotable Value New Zealand (QV). However, councils right around the country are still required by law to put what is now called a Rateable Value on properties, and in Nelson city the tender for this work was won by QV. It is to be emphasized that the valuations are carried out totally independently of the council, with the property owner having the right to dispute the valuation with the valuer before they are set.

Quote:  Government valuations, often used as a selling tool, did not necessarily reflect current market value. A home in Breaker Bay which recently sold for $235,000 above its GV was an example of that.
