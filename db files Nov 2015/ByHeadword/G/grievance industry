Quote:  By accepting compensation [the Chinese community] would, in a single action, have joined the "grievance industry" - an activity synonymous with failure, inertia, and an unwillingness to accept a responsibility for one's own outcomes. The Maori grievance industry is unique as Maori are the indigenous people, and have a fulcrum of newly enacted laws around which to litigate, and they clearly suffer severe handicaps which they do not seem to be able to unilaterally resolve... Of concern is that we now have a large Pacific Islands minority coat-tailing the Maori grievance industry.
