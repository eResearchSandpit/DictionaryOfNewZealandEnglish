Quote:  Exporter H Dawson Wool has found carpet and bedding manufacturers prepared to pay a premium for wool from GrowBulk and other high-bulk sheep... The GrowBulk project started in 1982 when, with the Wool Board's help, AgResearch scientist Roland Sumner began screening rams throughout New Zealand looking for high-bulk wools... Gore farmer Donald Morrison, who took on some GrowBulks as a trial in 1997, said they had far exceeded his expectations.
