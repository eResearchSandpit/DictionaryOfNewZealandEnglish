Quote:  [Caption] Guides and Brownies Sampling Biscuits before setting out on their annual Biscuit Sales...  1957 First Biscuit Week to earn Funds.<i> Ibid</i> 68 [Caption] Guides preparing for Biscuit Week... In 1957 it was decided to try out the Canadian and U.S.A. schemes for raising money by the sale of special Guide Biscuits. Messrs Cadbury Fry & Hudson consented to make the biscuits and share with Dominion Headquarters the responsibility of such a venture.
Notes:  In the Guide literature of this time they are just referred to as Biscuits - especially in the financial statements. Sometime between then and 1976 they picked up the "Girl Guide" soubriquet, probably from the public even though or possibly because the boxes were so labelled, probably by someone at Cadbury Fry & Hudson.

Quote:  Who among us can forget our early encounters with biscuits?... Jammy Shrewsburys, with their glorious chewy texture, and Girl Guide biscuits, which one ate in the time-honoured way of nibbling around the rim first, then working methodically towards the central medallion.
