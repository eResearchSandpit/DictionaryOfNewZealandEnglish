Quote:  The Maori name kumukumu [for Red Gurnard, <i>Corrupiscis kumu</i>] is often shortened by Europeans to `Kumu'. The Gurnards often make a grunting or growling noise when taken out of the water, and in some countries they are called `Growlers' on account of this peculiarity. The

grunting noise is caused by the escape of air from the air-bladder through the pneumatic duct.
