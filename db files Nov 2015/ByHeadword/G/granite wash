Quote:  In the Manuherikia Valley the gravel beds belonging to the series are termed, among the miners, the "granite" and the "granite wash"; though it is almost needless to say that any portion of the formation is quite innocent of <i>granite</i>, and none bears any resemblance to that rock except it be in the <i>hardness</i> of some of the cemented beds of quartz gravel.

Quote:  .. the alluvial miners thought they were dealing with superficial alluvial deposits; they called the conglomerates the `granite wash'. Deeper workings showed that the beds dipped steeply, and the gold continued downwards, the conglomerates were then called `deep leads', probably in the belief that they resembled the deep leads of Victoria.
