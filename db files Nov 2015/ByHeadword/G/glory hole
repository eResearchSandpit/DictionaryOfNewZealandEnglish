Quote:  ... he strode briskly, a quarter-filled sack of skids and gambols [94] over his shoulder, along the siding, stepping over the bright blotches of blood with the hovering blow-flies outside the `glory hole'....Chunks of wool-denuded meat [from the slipe master] were tossed into a barrow and, at intervals, wheeled to the `glory-hole'.
