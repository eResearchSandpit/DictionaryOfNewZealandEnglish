Quote:  There are three creeks in succession on this line of road - tributaries of the Kawarau River. The first is very small, and in a dry season merely drips from the rocks, and is called `Crying Jenny.' The second, which tumbles down from the mountains impetuously and with great noise, is `Roaring Meg.' The third, being a sluggish stream, has received, by popular assent, the designation of `Gentle Annie.'

Quote:  Amongst others who left [the Dunstan rush for Kawarau, c1862] were the members of a theatrical or concert party, and among them was a girl who sang a song called `Gentle Annie' and this name was sometimes jokingly applied to her. Going over the hills some of the rest were grouching, but she tramped on lugging her swag ... singing to cheer them on. The creek was  called after her because of her brave spirit. That was said to be the reason of the name Gentle Annie, but I never heard how Roaring Meg got its name. There is a yarn nowadays that both were called after barmaids ...

Quote:   There are now several bonnie burns coming down the mountain sides to the river, the largest of which are the famous Roaring Meg and Gentle Annie; and a visitor ... may wash his colours of gold from almost anywhere while his wee wife boils the billy. <i>Ibid.,</i> 53 ... Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of the stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few
miles further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself.

Quote:  THE NAME Gentle Annie evokes many things - rivers, mountain roads, hills - in all parts of the country. Gentle Annie is an elusive figure in our folklore; sometimes an object of tender love songs, she is also known, in the company of Roaring Meg, as a colourful figure in the bars of goldrush Queenstown.
