Quote:  We looked in vain to see what is said to be seen on the hard sand between Opotiki and Wakatane - a green and white penguin, the Korora, (sphemscus minor) taking a pipi shell to a great height, from whence it lets it fall on the beach, and then descends itself to pick out the flesh from the broken fragments of the shell.
