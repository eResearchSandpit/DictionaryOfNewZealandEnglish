Quote:  The homeless man cuts himself off from friends and family in the very early stages of the disease [of alcoholism], unlike his more settled counterparts. Often he does this by taking what is known in the treatment centres as a `geographical'. In their terms [sc. alcoholic vagrants'] it means continually making a fresh start in another town. ... Some reasons for taking a geographical are quite practical. ... Often those who haven't done many geographicals, or who haven't slept out much, don't think they are true alcoholics ...
