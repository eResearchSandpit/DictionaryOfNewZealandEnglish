Quote:  The fish, known as the `rattail' or Coelinchorus, were caught off the coast of ... Taranaki, in the orange roughy grounds at a depth of 800m ... The rattail also known as the grenadier is closely

related to the codfish family, feeding on the bottom of the ocean ... Of the 40 known species of Coelinchorus 11 of them seem to be indigenous only to New Zealand says Mr Paulins.
