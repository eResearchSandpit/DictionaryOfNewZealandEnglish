Quote:  "The consultation considers an alternative which would allow 'grandparenting' of foods containing genetically modified foods," Dr Durham said. "Grandparenting would mean that as long as biotechnology companies lodged their applications with FSANZ by 30 April, and had approval from overseas authorities that their product was safe they could keep selling their products until the full assessment was complete."

Quote:  What do the changes to the income thresholds mean for the group of superannuitants whose CSC eligibility was grandparented last year? Last year superannuitants who were affected by the 1 April increase to the New Zealand super had their CSC eligibility 'grandparented' to ensure they did not lose their CSC simply as a result of the cost of living adjustment. However, the grandparenting provision will be phased out over time until it is no longer needed.
