Quote:  I might say with propriety that six eighths of all the European houses are nothing more than grogeries. Here are in capital letters over the door `Tap'. One in particular so-called Hotel, a man and his family the only occupants, over the door a large sign one third as large as the front, with bold letters `Victoria Hotel.' Her Majesty must feel proud to have her name in blazon letters embellishing a house, where all kinds of satanical devices are practiced with [sic] impunity.
