Quote:  Plants belonging to [<i>Dracophyllum</i>] are generally known to colonists as grass-trees, though this term is also applied in Otago to the lancewood (<i>Pseudopanax</i>). The name is doubtless due to the long grass-like leaves of most of the species.  The broad-leaved species, <i>D. Traversii </i> of the South Island, and <i>D. latifolium </i>... of the Auckland, province, are known as nei-nei, and might almost be mistaken for a kind of cabbage-tree.
