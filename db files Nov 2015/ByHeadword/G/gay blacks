Quote:  In response to 2006 being a huge year for the Gay, Bi, Lesbian and Transgender ("GBLT") calendar, a group has been formed in Wellington & Christchurch named the Gay Blacks. This group consists of those intending to travel to the Gay Games, Chicago and Outgames, Montreal in July/August 2006.



The Gay Blacks will aim to assist those who wish to compete at either one or both of the games by providing:

- A co-ordinated approach to a team uniform

- Access to information on travel and accomodation opportunities

- Be a reference point for those people intending to participate both before and during the games
