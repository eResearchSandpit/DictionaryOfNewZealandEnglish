Quote:  Four years later, that rhetoric is being put to the test as her government negotiates to extend a seemingly arcane World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement, known as the General Agreement on Trade in Services or the GATS... The aim of the GATS is to lock open all New Zealand's services - including education, health, broadcasting, tourism, waste management, postal services, transport, energy, telecommunications and potentially water - to foreign companies.
