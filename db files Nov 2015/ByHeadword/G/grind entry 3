Quote:  Woolshed terms.-The water pot is a tin of water (usually disinfected) which a shearer has tied by him to wet his shears in. To  gap shears is to make (accidentally) a g. in the edge.  Sweat rag: kept by the shearer to wipe his brow. To grind (shears) is always used without the noun. A shearer never `grinds his shears.'
