Quote:  Jerry Fail... attended the sale on the Culverden estate, and bought most of the `gummies' for breeding purposes at as low a price as 1s 3d a-piece. A rumor [sic] that he is to have the barren ancients filled [sic] with false teeth is entirely without foundation.

Quote:  Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A

sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb  is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a  ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female  lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram  lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until  cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a  two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a  four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an  eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

<i>Ibid.</i>  96 Gummy. An old sheep that has lost all its teeth and reached the end of its useful existence.
