Quote:  A couple of close relatives casually used the word gatekeeper to refer to interfering pests who delete information from a data base... Today's gatekeeper is a person who controls the flow of information in a large organisation, deciding what is passed upwards to the executive levels or to a parent company, and downward to subordinate staff or subsidiary companies... I can see the gatekeeper now, grey-suited, in a windowless office, cackling softly, drunk with power and righteousness, accessing databases and sorting out the bits to be sent on their way up or down.
