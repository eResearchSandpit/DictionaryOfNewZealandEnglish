Quote:  <i>Gurnet</i> ... [<i>Gurnard</i> cross-referenced to<i> Gurnet</i>]  The species of <i>Trigla</i> found in British waters, called <i>Gurnards</i> are of the family of <i>Cottidae.</i> The word <i>Gurnet</i> is an obsolete or provincial form of Gurnard, revived in Australia, and  applied to the fish <i>Centropogon scorpaenoides</i>, Guich., family  <i>Scorpaenidae</i>. The original word <i>Gurnard</i> is retained in New Zealand, and applied to the new species <i>Trigla kumu (kumu</>being the Maori name), family <i>Cottidae</i>. The <i>Flying Gurnet</i> is <i>Trigla polyommata</i>, Richards., found on all the Australian coasts from New South Wales to Western Australia, family <i>Cottidae</i>. It is a distinct species, not included in the British species. They have large pectoral fins, but are not known to possess the power of supporting themselves in the air like the `flying fish' which belong to other genera. Sir Fredk. McCoy says that <i>Sebastes Percoides</i>, Richards., is called Gurnet, or Garnet-perch, by the fishermen and dealers, as well as the more common <i>Neosebastes scorpaenoides,</i>  Guich., and <i>Scorpaena panda</i>, Richards.
