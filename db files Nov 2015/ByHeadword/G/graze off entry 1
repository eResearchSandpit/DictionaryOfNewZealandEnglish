Quote:  .. such pastures not only grow a great deal more feed, but recover more rapidly after grazing off and come away earlier in the spring  .. it should be possible to start grazing off the spelled paddocks and carry the whole herd through the rest of the winter on grass alone. The more forward paddocks should be grazed off first .. the whole of the area originally spelled will have been grazed off by mid-August
