Quote:  The giant tussock grass, commonly called `pampas,' has had various botanical names, including

<i>Arundo selloana, Gynerium argenteum, Cortaderia  argentea</i>, and <i>Cortaderia selloana</i>. It is a native of the northern parts of Argentine ... and not the `pampas' as might be conjectured. ... The differences between pampas and the closely related native New Zealand toetoe have been described by Dr. H.H. Allan and V.D. Zotov in the New Zealand Journal of Agriculture, Vol. 50, p.274.
