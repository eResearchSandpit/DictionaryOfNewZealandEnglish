Quote:  The roach, originally from Western Australia, was thought to live only around the Gisborne and Auckland areas but some appear to have found their way south. The family which found them in Upper Hutt thought they were strange `beetles' but National Museum entomologist Ricardo Palma identified them as genus drymaplaneta, commonly known as the Gisborne cockroach. They are thought to have lived in Gisborne since the late 1960s.
