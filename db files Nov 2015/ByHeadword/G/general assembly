Quote:  For the government of the Colony as a whole there were constituted the two Houses which at present exist - the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives, together constituting the General Assembly. The councillors were nominated by the Governor, in this respect resembling the old nominee system. They held their seats for life. As showing the fear and detestation in which the word `nominee' was held, Mr. Fox and others who assisted in passing the measure viewed the relating clauses as the great blots of the Act.

Quote:  I was in Auckland attending the session of the Genl. Assembly. I went as representative of Omata, a district possessing now, 5 houses and a stockade. To add to the pleasures of the war we had a desperate political conflict. The two parties which divide us are the Ultra provincial and the General Govt. parties called opprobriously the Centralisers. The difference ... is no doubt the old difference under a new face, England or America?
