Quote:  The couple have developed the Greeline Composite sheep, a genetic package which at this stage comprises quarter East Friesian, three-eighths Texel and three-eighths Coopworth. ... Dunlop says driving the decision to develop the Greeline is the increasing emphasis being placed on and value being derived from lamb production. ... One of the results of the changing relativities between the returns from lamb meat and crossbred wool has been the development over the past decade of composite breed options such as the Greeline that followed the availability in New Zealand of the Texel and East Friesian.
