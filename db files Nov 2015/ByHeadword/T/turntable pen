Quote:  The sloping surface which gives a slide in from the side of a bath, the tipping pen in which the floor moves from the horizontal to a steep angle, and the turntable pen, all have the common purpose of getting the sheep into the bath with a minimum of effort and with little risk of injury to the sheep.
