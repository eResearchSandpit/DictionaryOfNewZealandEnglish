Quote:  [Hdg] Tapanui flu remains a mystery. Right now no one really knows what ME (myalgic emphysema or Tapanui flu) is all about, despite the fervent beliefs of some doctors and many patients who have been pigeon-holed in the appropriate diagnostic box.

Quote:  I first became aware of the debilitating nature of this in the early 80s when a workmate's daughter went down with what they then called Tapanbui flu just before whe was due to leave for the UK on her OE...

It has been called many names: Tapanui flu, myalgic encephalomyelitis and immune  dysfunction syndrome but it now seems that the medics in this country and Australia have settled on the term Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).
