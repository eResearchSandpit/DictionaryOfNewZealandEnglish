Quote:  Some of the smaller tussock (<i>Poa colensoi</i>), alpine fescue tussock (<i>Festuca matthewsii</i>) and bristle tussock (<i>Notodanthonia asetifolia</i>), have become aggressive in this way. Bristle tussock now now dominates in parts of Marlborough and North Canterbury while the other two are more important in inland areas of South Canterbury and Otago.
