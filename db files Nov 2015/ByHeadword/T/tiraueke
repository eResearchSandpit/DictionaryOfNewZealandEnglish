Quote:  Another bird, the tierawaki (Jeterus rufisater, Less.), is very common. It is as large as a blackbird, of a jet-black plumage, with red-brown coverlets of the wings and tail. It has two small orange-coloured appendages at the base of the beak. This bird is seen on the lower branches of trees, is very lively, and has a loud penetrating note. It always screams when anything attracts its attention - huei, huei, tierawak, tierawak. It feeds principally on fleshy berries, but also on coleopterous insects.
