Quote:  `Tin Hat.' - `Thicknut' asks: Can anyone tell me why the `Heads' are called `Tinhats'? Are they any relation to the beings known in mythology as `tin gods'? [The terms `Tin Hat' and `Brass Hat' were current years before the war began, especially `Tin Hat.' Probably the expression had its origin in the metallic headgear worn by some of the military units in pre-war days. There is no evidence (at least no etymological evidence) that `tin-hat' is a corruption of `tin-head,' as one cynic has suggested.]
