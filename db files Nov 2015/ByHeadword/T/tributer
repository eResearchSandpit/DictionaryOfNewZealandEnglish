Quote:  A good deal of antimony-ore occurred in this mine, and gold film or `paint' on clay selvages was frequently met with, doubtless indicating secondary enrichment. Mining at Boatman's has declined very much, and work is now limited to intermittent tributers and occasional prospectors.

Quote:   As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Quote:  The pitches will be offered to enable tributers to earn 40s. a week, and they expect that this will be an inducement to many miners to abandon the precarious occupation of gold digging, which has so long suspended their works.

Quote:  The member for Thames points out that it is alleged that the price paid by the Banks is not commensurate with the rates realised in Great Britain and America and as a result mining in New Zealand is handicapped and private claim holders and tributers who are not in a position to export, are especially placed to disadvantage.

Quote:  All who have worked underground, and have had to try the presence of copper, which often exists in the shape of a rich black oxide, very profitable to the tributer, will be aware how that rude chemist moistens the sooty substance and applies it to the flame of his candle, and how satisfied he is, if the green flame appears, that the true metal exists in his ore, and that he is not deceived by the black oxide of iron, and other more worthless substances.
