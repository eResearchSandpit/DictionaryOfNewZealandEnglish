Quote:  The timber-dealer in conducting his raft down the river at flood tide (<i>tai parre</i>[e-acute],) drops an anchor, (a heavy piece of wood or bag of stones) at the end of the flood

(<i>tai pakoa</i>[a1-acute]) in deep water, that he may be enabled to pursue his route at the finish of the ebb (<i>tai timu</i>.)
