Quote:  The great labour of growing taro maori (the old pre-European variety) caused it to be abandoned when the taro Merekena was introduced. The latter is hardy, prolific, runs wild in fact, and easily cultivated, but it is very inferior in flavour and flouriness to taro maori. I don't think I have seen taro maori for thirty years.
