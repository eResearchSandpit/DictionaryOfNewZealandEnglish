Quote:  Winston has won the ballot, something of a coup so close to an election, though his version does little more than delete the offensive phrase "treaty principles" from 27 acts.

Quote:  He then laid into "the elements within our leadership" who, he says, are prepared to sell Treaty rights for cash - "mixing the kai with the tapu", as he put it, "having their hands in the hangi".

Quote:  The imposition of the so-called "Treaty process" upon New Zealanders, by an unholy alliance of left-wing social engineers and Maori activists, was actually a covert declaration of war against the better part of all things European in this country.

Quote:  `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi.

As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued

Quote:  She sees the Treaty process as a disincentive, however, because it has created an expectation in some quarters that really big benefits are on the way... The Treaty process has reinforced the iwi model, perhaps because iwi are nice, neat compartmentable boxes into which you can put things, such as apologies and reparations, whereas urban Maori are a comparatively ill-defined lot.
