Quote:  Among the trees Mr. Traill pointed out [on Stewart Island], was what he called a `Ti Mi' tree, and which he said was only found growing in one place in New Zealand, that being Mokai, on the west coast of the North Island. He stated that the Maori tradition about it was this - that the first Maoris who visited New Zealand came in a large canoe built of `Ti Mi' wood, and they landed at Mokaia, where there is a good harbour. canoe got broken up, and some of the planks took root and grew.' Paulin WWC, pp. 33-4. [Andersen notes:] The canoe referred to was the `Tainui', and the tree is said to be the karaka or kopi. White Ancient History Maori (1890), vol. 4, p. 38. Ti Mi is probably intended for tainui: this tree is said to have sprung from the skids of the `Tainui' canoe. Cheeseman Manual NZ Flora (1906), p. 100.
