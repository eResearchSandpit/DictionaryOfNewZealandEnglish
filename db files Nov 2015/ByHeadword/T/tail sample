Quote:  <i>Tail samples</i>: Regular samples of the tailings were taken to check that maximum recovery of precious minerals was being obtained. The values contained in the tailings did not usually exceed half a pennyweight of gold per ton of ore, except in the concentrate tailing, which it was uneconomic to grind to the degree of fineness required to recover the last six pennyweights (0.3 oz) per ton. Overall recovery was usually over 90% of the values.
