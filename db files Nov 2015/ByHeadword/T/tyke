Notes: Bob Cotterall writes that the word, as referring to Catholics, was "In Auckland in common use round the 1900's, and came from the number of Yorkshire Catholics in  circulation. Very common in  referring to Catholic rugby teams. USE IN PRINT. Bishop Cleary was displeased on finding the sentence "...but Tykes came again" in a report of a rugby match that appeared in the SHC Magazine round about 1929, 1930, 1931 or 1932, and referred, in "<i>The Month</i>" to (I think) '..an unpleasant epithet. Anyhow, it's there, in  print, round about 1929-32 in the Sacred Heart annual mag." ca1930 W.H. Orsman
