Quote:  An early contender, with more than a  dash of local character, was certainly Taniwha soap. A by-product of one of the country's defining features, the meatworks, its very name conjured up mythical monsters, while the label displayed a bevy of topless mermaids lathering up against a backdrop of smoking volcanoes.
