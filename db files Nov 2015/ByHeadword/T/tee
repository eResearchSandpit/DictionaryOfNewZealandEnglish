Notes: ca1951 R. Gilberd (Okaihau) [?definition] 2. <i>`Swinging T' </i>- a foot with a length of wire attached which is either stapled to the post above the ground or twisted onto the bottom wire. 3. <i>`Anchored T' -</i> similar to a `swinging T', but no post is used. The anchor wire is twisted around each wire in turn, holding them at correct elevation. It is used where posts have to be packed to the fence-line, e.g. in the Gisborne district.
