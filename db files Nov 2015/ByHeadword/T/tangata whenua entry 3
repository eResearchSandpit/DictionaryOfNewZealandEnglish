Quote:  Tangata whenua - `whenua' (q.v.) is the placenta which was usually buried in a special place which would not be walked over and thus defiled by anyone. Thus a person's spiritual well being was linked with the land belonged to. `Tangata whenua' thus refers to the `people belonging to the land', who have therefore the right to live there according to their own traditions and values.
