Quote:  The bags - which have been in use since The Correspondence School (TCS) started in 1922 - are a quaint reminder of a pastoral, low-tech New Zealand that has faded quickly in the past two decades... Eight in 10 of TCS's secondary students are dual-enrolled, and 98 per cent of New Zealand's secondary schools use the service.
