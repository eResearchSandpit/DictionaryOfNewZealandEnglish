Quote:  The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Quote:  Fine-wool sheep, expecially Merinos, are much slower than crossbred sheep. Wrinkles, dense wool, trimmings, all have a bearing on shearing. <i>Ibid.</i> 9

Quote:  Reaching the end of the walk, and things just going fair, he returned and again said to the tall Moree Myall, `You are still cutting too often - go easy,' but the light limbed Australian continued to strip the `Basil' from the unfortunate stud ewe he was shearing. Standing by, the Moree native engaged in taking off the trimmings around the udder, then deliberately swept the glistening steel of his razor shears across the teats of the stud ewe, and deliberately shore them off level with the belly line.
