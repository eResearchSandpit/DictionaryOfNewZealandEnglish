Quote:  All the clubs have added a race for the new Takapuna one-design class... The first boat is now ready for launching... Some difficulty is being experienced in getting the sails, owing to a shortage of the necessary silk cloth.

Quote:  Next to the X class. is the Z class, or what are often referred to as the Cornwall Cup boats. They owe their existence to a small band of Takapuna yachtsmen who planned the first boat, with much the same idea in their minds as did George Honour when he built the first of the 14-foot square bilge boats, namely, low first cost, ease of construction, and an ever-watchful eye on speed and performance under Auckland harbour weather conditions.  The yachts were originally designed for the Takapuna Boating Club but owing to their popularity from the outset the type was quickly adopted by many other yacht clubs throughout New Zealand... From small beginnings the Takapuna one-design  class rapidly expanded.

Quote:  The Z class, or "Zeddie" as it was affectionately known, was another class which was designed as a low cost sailing boat to get the boys into something safer than the tin canoes or derelict dinghies in which they cruised Shoal Bay. Ibid. 114 The Takapuna Boating Club which was then situated at Bayswater, was the sponsoring club and the yachts were often referred to as the "Takapuna Class".

Quote:  On the other hand to be in a fleet of Takapunas and come about the weather mark, in a cloud of blossoming spinnakers and fly away before the breeze in a surge of foam was a roundabout which made up for the swing.
