Quote:  The Director [of Repatriation] .. soon after the passing of the Repatriation Act in 1918, set out, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, to establish a training-farm at Tauherenikau, in the Wairarapa district, where returned soldiers suffering from chest trouble could be trained in poultry-keeping, bee-keeping, horticulture and general light farming so as to enable them to take up small holdings of their own under the Discharged Soldiers Settlement Act. The accompanying photographs afford a very good idea of the training-farm.
