Quote:  A lump of wood of little or no great significance is thus transformed through the art process, by building words (korero) into it and by contact with people, into ting Maoris class as a taonga, or in full, he taonga tuku iho. The dictionary describes taonga as 'property', or as 'anything highly prized' (Williams 1971: 381). Thus a taonga tuku iho is a highly prized object that has been handed down from the ancestors. <i>Ibid.</i> 22 In the popular sense a taonga is a highly prized possession to which is attached korero (text or story). An example is a whakapapa (genealogy) staff.
