Quote:  It is true that this is primarily a trampers' hut, but trampers don't usually carry periodicals in their swags. ... But here the two journals are now, and I wish I knew how often they are read by the other users of this shelter - rabbiters, deer-cullers, roadmen, storm-bound swaggers, and so on.
