Quote:  Somewhat similar in general appearance save that the crest consists of elongated drooping feathers is the Tufted Penguin, which never breeds on the mainland but frequents the Snares, Antipodes, Auckland, Campbell, and Macquarrie [sic] Islands, and is even found within the Antarctic Circle, as is recorded by Scott, Shackleton, and Mawson.
