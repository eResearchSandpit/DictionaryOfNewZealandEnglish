Quote:  Trying houses. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/37 There was much stench from whale-oil, but this was disregarded, so great was the interest I felt in the whole process. After I had inspected the trying-houses, in cleaning which a native of Australia was occupied, of whose intelligence and quickness his master spoke very highly, I went through the village.
