Quote:  <i>tawhiri,</i> a tree (Pittosporum tenuifolium); so called because small branches were broken off to wave welcome while calling out haeremai to approaching visitors: tawhiri means to beckon. The tree has smallish chocolate-coloured flowers very fragrant in summer evenings and nights, when the bowers of the trees too are a-flutter with the visiting lady-moths: also called ko[o]hu[u]hu[u] and tawhiwhi.
