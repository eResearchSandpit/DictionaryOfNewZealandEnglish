Now the Wetherstone diggings were very quiet, so that I objected to men being put up and let go to alarm the place - for I anticipated robbing this banker sooner or later, and that would do me.

In the United States, the word has a definite meaning - a district, subordinate to a country, the inhabitants having power to regulate their local affairs; in Australia, the word has no such definite meaning. It may be large or small, and sometimes consists of little more than the post-office, the public-house, and the general store or shop.

Quote:  Townships are formed here and there as settlement proceeds; - at first a store and post office, a cottage or a blacksmith's shop perhaps; then a hotel, another store, and again another hotel. <i>Ibid.</i> 20  Sanguine in their anticipations, and bountifully provident for the wants of posterity, the promoters of these bush townships - whether it were the Government, private companies or individuals, or a supplementing of the former by the latter - made the boundaries of them wide enough for all possible future requirements, and gave ample scope for prospective development. This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates

Quote:  During our short history villages have come and gone, have flourished and then decayed, and some once again flourished. There is a story behind all these happenings. These many widely-scattered urban oases in the rural desert have been known for all their short lives as `townships'. A very ugly name coming down to us from the old digging days. Village' or just `town' are now gaining ground over the ugly old name, and rightly so. You could scarcely talk of beautifying a township, but could get quite enthusiastic over improving a village.

The natives will make a strange word out of `township'.
