Quote:  <i>Trevally,</i> or <i>Trevalli,</i> or<i> Trevalla</i>, or <i>Travale, n.</i> an Australian fish. In various localities the name is applied to several fishes, which are most of them of the family <i>Carangidae</i>, or <i>Horse-Mackerels.</i> An Old-World name for the Horse-mackerels is <i>Cavalli</i> (Ital. <i>cavallo</i>, a little horse). ... The Maori name for the <i>Trevally</i> is

<i>Awara<i> [sic, ?Arara[sic]], and in Auckland it is sometimes called the <i>Yellow-Tail</i> (q.v.). See also quotation, 1886. Gunther says, the genus <i>Teuthis</i> is readily recognised by the peculiar structure of the ventral fins, which have an outer and an inner spine and three soft rays between.

Quote:  TREVALLY (ARAARA) <i>Usacaranx lutescens</i> (Richardson) For some unknown reason small Warehou sold on the Dunedin Fish Market and in the shops of Dunedin were called Trevally and the same fish with the same markings when grown to eighteen or twenty-four inches in length were known as Warehou. Just how and when these small Warehou received the name Trevally no one seems to know. .../ [T]he old time Maori was recognised as a student of Nature and much more observant than the Pakeha, who blindly follows other and called fish by all sorts of names without ever stopping to think - as for instance when they call Seaperch the John Dory. Each fish is totally different. The misuse of common names of fish in New Zealand is most glaring but the mistake of calling the young Warehou by the name of Trevally is not made in the North Island, as both species are caught there; only odd Trevally are caught south of Cook Strait.

Known simply as trevally in New Zealand, being the only species present; called white or silver trevally in southern Australia ... Our trevally was known for a long time as <i>Caranx lutescens,</i> and distinct from though obviously related to an Australian species. In 1974 it was recognised that there was a single somewhat variable Australasian species, <i>Caranx georgianus </i>(for a while <i>Usacaranx</i>), which took this name by historical precedence.
