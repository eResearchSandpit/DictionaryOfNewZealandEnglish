Quote:  <i>tui</i>, a bird (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), the most characteristic of the smaller Maori birds, kept by the Maori as a pet and by them taught to speak, it being an excellent mimic, and so by the settlers called the mocking-bird, shortened to mockie, and called parson-bird because of the two white curled tufts of feathers at its throat. Then, [check parson-bird inclusion - not in Journ Polyn Soc ref???] because some folk thought mockie was short for makomako, a name of the bell-bird (korimako) in some parts, some thought it was the korimako which was the mimic, and hence both birds have been called the mocking-birds.
