Quote:  <i>Sterna ... frontalis [? striata] </i>... It pursues schools of small fish close to the coasts of New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, and as the kahawai fish also feed on the same class of food, the tern is a useful indicator to fishermen of their presence. Hence its name of kahawai bird. Kahawai Bird. Sea Swallow, Tom Noddy. TARA.
