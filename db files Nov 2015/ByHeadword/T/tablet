Quote:  Inside the station they had the big red metal boxes that work the old-fashioned tablet signalling system. If you ever wonder what drivers are picking up or unloading on the end of a curved piece of wood, it is the tablet or biscuit. A train cannot get through a section of rail without the biscuit matching the one in the red metal box, which is connected to the manually operated signals. Automatic signals are phasing this system in to rural museums.
