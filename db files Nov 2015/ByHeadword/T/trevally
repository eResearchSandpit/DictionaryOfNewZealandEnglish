Quote:  WAREHOU <i>Seriolella brama</i>(Gunther) In Otago, commercial and sport fishermen, auctioneers, retailers, consumers of fish and readers generally have for many years been giving the name Trevally

(Usacaranx lutescens) to small Warehou up to twelve inches in length. It is to be hoped that this misnomer will continue to be replaced by the proper name of Warehou.

Quote:  The Warehou is a southern fish becoming less plentiful in the North Island. It is known as the Trevally, and sold under this name, in Dunedin and Christchurch. It is an excellent food fish, and is always in good demand. It is also found in Australia where it is known as the `Whario' a corruption of the Maori name Wharehou, and in Tasmania it is sold as `Snogtail' Trevally. <i>Ibid.</i> 170 Warehou Seriolella brama Trevally; Sea Bream
