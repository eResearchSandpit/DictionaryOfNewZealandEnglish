Quote:  The brigade, however, seemed to have some inspiration or other which its own brains and tongues did not supply, but as their "distinguished organ," to quote Mr Williams' sarcastic phrase, seldom meets the eye of any but a Timaruvian, their dogged obstinacy in retrogade policy was perplexing to the public.

Quote:  We have just as ardent a desire to see a cable laid between Australia and New Zealand as any Timaruvian breathing, and shall hail with delight the day on which the work is begun (which day we believe is not far distant), but we certainly do object in the strongest manner possible to the way in which the railway is spoken of.
