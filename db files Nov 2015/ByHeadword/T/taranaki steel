Quote:  The landing [at Onehunga] used to be effected through heavy surf upon the black sand of the seashore....This sand is composed of a very fine haematite iron ore, which many projectors have made vain efforts to utilise commercially, and out of which a small quantity of what is known as `Taranaki Steel' is made, used chiefly for surgical instruments.
