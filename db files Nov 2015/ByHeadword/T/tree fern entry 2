Quote:  The great uncoiling fronts [of the mamuku] are thickly clothed with dark brown scales ... It is these scales which gave the name black tree-fern in contradistinction to the name silver tree-fern given to the ponga (Cyathea dealbata) with its silvery-undersided fronds.

Quote:   ... we can be sure that the beauty-loving soul of the ancient Maori delighted whole-heartedly in these lovely inhabitants of the New Zealand bush. However, his interest in the different tree ferns was certainly not purely aesthetic. Take, for instance, the mamaku, or `black tree fern'

(<i>Cyathea medullaris</i>). This is one of the largest and most handsome of all our tree ferns. It can be distinguished by the black stalks of the fronds and the leaf scars that form a definite pattern all round the slender black stem.
