Quote:  Catching butcher-boys was good fun ... You chose a piece of footpath where there was no tar-sealing and looked for little round holes in the earth. When you found a hole, you pushed the soft end of a grass stalk into it ... As soon as it moved you pulled it out and caught a small white grub clinging to the end with its nippers.
