Quote:  `The jade, the pounamu ... It's a beautiful stone ... Look,' he said, holding up a long hooked ear-drop of pearly translucence, `that's tau tau and the stone is called inanga. And this, the pekapeka - they say the shape comes from the bat. This is for the ear, too - the mako, like a shark's tooth ... And these,' - he ran his fingers along a row of ... nephrite adzes - `toki. See this one' - he held the heavy red-mottled adze in his palm - `that's the red kind, totoweka, woodhen's blood. The deep green, that's kawakawa.'
