Quote:  <i>Cnemiornis calcitrans</i>. - Tarepo. (Kaimanawa Range?) A large bird is mentioned in the Transactions of the N.Z. Institute by, I believe, Mr. T. Cockburn Hood, as having been killed by a settler's dogs; which bird, if I remember rightly, was supposed by the writer to be a Tarepo.

Quote:  This discovery (I mean of the bone, for the living bird never materialised, although explorers found plenty of caves) was made on the east coast, where the natives called the bird the "tarepo." Four years later, on the west coast, he found a perfect cemetery of these bones and heard the bird called for the first time the "moa" - the natives, very singularly, never having heard the name used by their brethren on the other side of the island.
