Quote:   `When your dog gets the sheep `home', he must bring them right into the circle, on the far side if possible, and hold them perfectly still - yourself, the sheep, and the dog all in line: the sheep looking at the dog and the dog looking at the sheep, although the dog doesn't have to be in the ring. This is called the `twelve o'clock hold'.
