Notes: Jim writes: In relation to curtains or drapes there is no entry for these words in any dictionary I have seen., <i>Track</i> may be covered, though imprecisely, under one of the general definitions but <i>tracking</i> is not. Both words are in standard use in NZ. They seem likely to be international English but may be worth checking out.
