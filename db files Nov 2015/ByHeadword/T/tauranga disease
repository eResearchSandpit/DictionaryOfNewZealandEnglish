Quote:  [Hdg] "Tauranga" or "Bush Disease". This peculiar wasting disease, which is confined to the tract of land lying in the vicinity of Tauranga, and extending from there to Rotorua and Lichfield, was made the subject of an investigation by Mr. Park three years ago... It appears that both sheep and cattle will do well and put on condition for the first few months after being placed on this diseased country, but as time goes on a gradual wasting sets in, which ends in death if they are not removed to another district.

Quote:  It would seem that to deal thoroughly with the matter much more time and research will have to be given to it, than the examination of a few sheep or lambs can accomplish, though done by as able an expert as Professor Thomas; whose instructions, as to parasitical disease, seem to have been carried out as well as opportunity allowed, and yet disclosed nothing specially distinct in the Tauranga disease.
