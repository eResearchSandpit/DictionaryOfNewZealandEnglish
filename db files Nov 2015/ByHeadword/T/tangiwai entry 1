Quote:  There are two kinds of greenstone, that which is commonly seen, and which is named the ponamoo, and another sort more glassy and transparent named tuggewai. The ponamoo is exceedingly hard, and has an irregular fracture. The tuggewai is much softer, of a more transparent green, and divides easily into plates.

Quote:  Among the Maori, considerations of aesthetic interest helped quite materially ... to decide

the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu</i>, the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the <i>inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.

Quote:  A material similar in appearance to greenstone, but known to the geologists as bowenite and to the Maori as tangiwai, is widely used in the same manner as greenstone. Some pieces are quite translucent while others show the characteristic yellow-brown colouration. Bowenite is a softer material than greenstone.

Quote:  One of the party, who in past years had seen a great deal of work by the Maoris in greenstone, and had a good knowledge of the stone, disputed somewhat hotly Captain Hutton's ruling. The Maoris call this kind tangiwai, an allusion to the water contained in it.

Quote:  Tangiwai is clear like glass, and ranges from olive-gree to bluish green.  Most tangiwai is sourced from two isolated areas at Piopiotahi (Milford Sound).  Koko-tangiwai, the longer name for this stone, referes to a deep sorrow that is never completely healed.
