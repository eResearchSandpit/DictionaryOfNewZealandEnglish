Quote:  [On the attack on the Ngati Paoa at Whakatiwai.] The object of this attack was to balance an `utu' account. ... [sic] Ngati Paoa say this account had been previously squared, and the killings which happened at this attack were murders. The other side deny this and say that the balance was against them previously, but the deaths of the three men who fell wound up the account and the whole proceeding was `tika'(correct).
