Quote:  The only true mackerels recorded from Canterbury are the Pacific Bonito (<i>Sarda chiliensis</i>) and the large-scaled Tunny (<i>Gasterochisma melampus</i>) which may reach a length of 6 feet; but a related family includes the well-known Barracouta (<i>Thyrsites atun</i>), the King Barracouta, <i>Jordanidia solandrii </i>(often known locally as Kingfish, but not to be confused with the North Island Kingfish which is a form or Yellowtail) and the elongated, silvery-hued frost fish (<i>Lepidopus caudatus</i>) whose curious stranding habits can hardly yet be said to be satisfactorily explained.

Quote:  TUNAS ... Tuna were generally known as `tunny' until the discovery of a potentially big export market to America, where tuna is rated a luxury fish. The name as then changed to conform with that used in America. Since then Southern Bluefin tuna, Yellowfin tuna and Striped, or Skipjack, tuna have been developed into important export fishes. In New Zealand the Albacore has become an important commercial fish.
