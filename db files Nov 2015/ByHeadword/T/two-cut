Quote:  My advice to all is to concentrate on shearing to a pattern, keeping the comb on the sheep, watching yourself for `two-cut' and keeping it to a minimum. <i>Ibid.</i> 158 TWO-CUT. This happens where the staple of wool is cut above its base on the sheep, making it necessary for the handpiece to come back and trim off a short piece of wool that has been cut before. Such short pieces are of little value.
