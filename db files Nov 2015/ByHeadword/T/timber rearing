Quote:  <i>Timber rearing</i>: Usually a wall at the end of a stope partitioning off the ladderway and consisting of 5 ft slabs nailed vertically to stulls wedged between the walls. Also used to make the central `box' in a three-compartment rise. Sometimes cribbing was used instead of building a rearing.
