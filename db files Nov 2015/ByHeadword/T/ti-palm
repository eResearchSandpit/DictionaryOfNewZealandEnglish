Quote:  The appearance of Ti palms on the Canterbury plains is very remarkable. They rise amidst the short rich grass with their thick stalks and graceful crest; often when one looks up suddenly from the ground, startling with their likeness to men. One of our wags remarked of these plants, that they looked `like men as trees walking'. A less observant youth having lost his way a few nights ago, in the neighbourhood of the capital, was cheered in the loneliness of the prairie, by the appearance of a man approaching. He took off his hat, (not having yet forgotten the courteous address of the old country,) and accosted the stranger, `I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell me which is the way to Christchurch.' It was a Ti palm.

Quote:  The distinctive marks which characterise it as not English are the occasional Ti palms, which have a very tropical appearance, and the luxuriance [34] of the Phormium tenax. <i>Ibid.</i> ix/132 The cabbage-tree or ti palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.
