Quote:  Tamariki, Tamarikitanga - children were traditionally openly cared for, and shared particularly by both parents and grandparents; they had the advantage of being able to expect similar care and protection from not just close kin, but other parents within the hapu (larger kinship group). They were encouraged to become independent and responsible as quickly as possible. One detrimental effect of urbanisation on the economic realities of today is the breakdown evident in such caring.
