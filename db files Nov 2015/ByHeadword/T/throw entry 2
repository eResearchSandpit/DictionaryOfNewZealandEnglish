Quote:  Bill hadn't learned to pick up and throw a fleece, and he felt the anger of a fleeco was directed at him for not getting stuck in when the shearer cried, `Wool away!' ... Fleecos hated this; it made the fleece difficult to throw. The aim was to stand by as the shearer made his last blow, gather the fleece into a compact armful, and throw it like a tablecloth on the wooltable, weather side up.
