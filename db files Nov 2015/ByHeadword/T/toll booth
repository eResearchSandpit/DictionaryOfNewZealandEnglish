Quote:  What then was United States ambassador Paul Cleveland doing emerging from a public telephone toll booth at one of Wellington's post offices. Handing over a large sum of cash to pay for what the teller announced was a 15-minute toll call, he seemed sheepish on discovering he had been observed.
