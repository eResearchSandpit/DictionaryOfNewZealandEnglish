Quote:  In 1875 G.G.Stead (1841-1908), the famous race-horse owner, bought a half-share in Redwood's racing stud. Under the partnership agreement Stead managed the business side while the training was put in the hands of E. Cutts. The horses were raced in the name of one or other of the partners. This arrangement, which proved immensely successful, lasted into the 1890s and was terminated when Stead bought out Redwood's share of the stud. During his lifetime Henry Redwood was known as `the Father of the New Zealand Turf.'

Quote:  <i>they're off, Mr Cutts!</i> the race has begun; Partridge identifies as a variant of `they're off', said the monkey', usually indicating start of a horse race, hence as something that has come loose; often with addition: `when he looked into the lawnmower and carelessly lost his testicles.' This addition may explain Mr Cutts. NZA.
