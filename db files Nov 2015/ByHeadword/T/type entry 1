Quote:  [Mount Ruapehu] Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking'. The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers, show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd-bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist! They were treated with loftiest contempt. I suppose I come under the heading `odd-bod', vouched for by a `type' ...
