Quote:  A trialist is also someone, within whom hope springs eternal. that the sheep will be all right this year, that the dog isn't going to get 'trial happy' after the third trial, and the judge will always look as kindly at your run as you do yourself.

Quote:  "TRIAL Happy"... This is what a man tags his dog when said dog does not listen. Dog is pat to "taking over" meaning dog thinks he knows what he is doing so shall do it their way, knowing full well that "BOSS" can't reprimand him.
