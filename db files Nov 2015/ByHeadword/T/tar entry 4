Quote:  This figure comes from Traffic Accident Reports (TAR) filled out by the police after every accident involving injury they attend... Kippenburger says there are many corners on rural roads that drivers don't manage to negotiate even at 80km/h, and these will probably be recorded as excessive speed on a TAR sheet.
