Quote:  <i>Tutu</i>, or <i>Toot, n</i>. Maori name for a shrub or small tree, <i>Coriaria ruscifolia,</i> Linn., or <i>C. sarmentosa,</i> Forst., of New Zealand, widely distributed. It bears greenish flowers, and shiny pulpy black berries. From these the Maoris make a wine resembling light claret, taking care to strain out and not to crush the seeds, which are poisonous, with an action similar to that of strychnine. It goes also by the name of <i>Wineberry-bush</i>, and the Maori name is Anglicised into <i>Toot.</i> In Maori, the final <i>u</i> is swallowed rather than pronounced. In English names derived from the Maori, a vowel after a mute letter is not sounded. It is called in the North Island <i>Tupakihi.</i> In Maori, the verb <i>tutu</i> means to be hit, wounded, or vehemently wild, and the name of the plant thus seems to be connected with the effects produced by its poison. To `eat your toot': used as a slang phrase; to become acclimatised, to settle down into colonial ways.

Quote:  The toot-plant, tutu or tupakihi of the Maoris ... is a small bush, one of the most common and widely distributed shrubs of the islands. It produces a sort of `hoven' or narcotic effect on sheep and cattle, when too greedily eaten. It bears a fruit, which is produced in clusters, not unlike a bunch of currants, with the seed external, of a purple colour. The poisonous portion of the plant to man are the seeds and seed-stalks, while their dark purple pulp is utterly innocuous and edible. The natives express from the berries an agreeable violet juice (carefully avoiding the seed), called native wine.
