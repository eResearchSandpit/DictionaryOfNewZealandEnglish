Notes: (from tpk.govt.nz) Due to the large population and land area, TRAION has implemented Takiwa (natural geographical groupings) to assist with the management of issues relating to the population and the marae that fall into the Ngapuhi catchment area. There are also two Taurahere (urban groupings) since 80% of the tribe live outside the traditional Ngapuhi boundaries (40% in Auckland alone). The TRAION structure is grassroots focussed with the marae and all who whakapapa to these marae being the main drivers for the vision, and for the tribal immortality of Ngapuhi.
