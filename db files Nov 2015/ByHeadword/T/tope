Quote:  TOPE OR SCHOOL SHARK <i>Notogaleus rhinophanes</i> (Peron) The origin of the vernacular name Tope is not certain, but local fishermen who followed this occupation in Britain, said this name is a corruption of `top' in allusion to its well-known habit of following the lines to the top of the water and then snatching off Whiting or other hooked fish in full view of the helpless fisherman. Other New Zealand common names are Southern Tope and School Shark.
