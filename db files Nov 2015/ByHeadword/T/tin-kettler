Quote:  <i>A Tin-kettling Episode</i>: The detestable practice of tin-kettling a newly-married couple [with kerosine tins] doesn't seem to die out like other barbarities in this country; it is a relic of by-gone days. ... The origin of the custom has never been authoritatively determined and whether it is an English or purely Colonial custom ... doesn't appear to be known. However, the tin-kettlers expect the happy bridegroom to stop the din by handing them cakes and ale. ... It is only the idiotic low-class class of people who would go banging tin-cans opposite a man's house after dark ... .

Quote:  I was married in Greymouth in 1937 ... a crowd of children and young adults arrived, armed with noisemakers ... But, six months ago, here in Rotorua, my young neighbour remarried and I was surprised and delighted to see and hear the `tin-kettlers' arrive when the young couple returned from their honeymoon.

Quote:  `The local farmers put their heads together and planned a tin-kettling party. In the hands of people were carried an assortment of pots and kettles, wooden and metal spoons, kerosene tins containing stones as a rattle, old-fashioned car horns ... The tin-kettling was not complete until the house was circled by the tin-kettlers.'

Quote:  The "tin-kettlers" are made up by the male friends of those just married, amounting sometimes, if the bridegroom is popular, to fifty persons, the "tin-kettles" used being generally kerosene tins, which are beaten with sticks, sometimes small stones are put in the tin, and the thing is shaken, drums are beaten, pipes played, and everything done which can tend to make a noise.
