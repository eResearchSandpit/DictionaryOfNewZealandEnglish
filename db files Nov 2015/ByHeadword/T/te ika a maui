Quote:  Chants that emphasized the points of a weighty speech in the runanga-house, short ditties that maidens carolled forth about the pa, war songs that fired the hearts of warriors on the march-these were heard through the length and breadth of Te Ika-a-Maui, Maori poets vieing one with another to compose songs suitable for the occasion.
