Quote:  New Zealand has no large fresh-water fish. The only exception is the<i> tuna</i>, or eel; there are many varieties of it, and almost all the other fresh-water fish partake more or less of a similar character. The number of names given to this fish, and the careful way they have noticed every little difference between one and another, clearly shows the great value the natives put upon it. <i>Ibid.</i> 498  The principal ones are the<i> tuna</i>, eel, the <i>pipiharau</i>, lamprey, the <i>kokopu,</i> and <i>inanga ... </i>
