Quote:  Fighting above Anzac Cove in late April 1915 would be similar to fighting today on the gorse and scrub-covered slopes around Wellington Harbour and the Hutt. It `was very thick and stood about 5ft high and was of a laurel leaf type very like `Tote' that is found in New Zealand.' It was such scrub that the Anzacs laid in their coffin trenches.
