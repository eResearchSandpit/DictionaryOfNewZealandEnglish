Quote:  <i>Taipo</i>, for instance, of course one knows its meaning, though it has been adopted chiefly as a name as common as `Dash' or `Nero' for New Zealand dogs; all the same the writers upon Maori superstitions seem to have no knowledge of it. Polach [sic], Dieffenbach, Nicholas, Yates, call their evil spirits <i>whiros</i> or <i>atuas</i>. Tepo, the place of darkness, is the nearest they have come to it. I think myself it is South Island Maori, often differing a little in spelling and use; and so very much the larger proportion of New Zealand literature is the literature of the North.'

Quote:  a New Zealand word for devil, often applied by settlers to a vicious horse or as a name for a dog. There is a dangerous river, the Taipo, on the west coast. There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says -

-->`No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying, `Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' -->On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his `Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - -->`Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <i>tae</i>, to arrive; <i>po</i>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on `Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - -->`Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.'

Terapuhi was still shaking with fear, but gradually he recovered and said, `Tae-po does sometimes come like that, and not do any harm, but I told you this is a bad place.' <i>Ibid.</i>96 Tae-po, an evil spirit, from the verb <i>tae</i>, to arrive, and <i>po</i>, night or darkness. An evil nocturnal visitor, incorrectly (as a rule), put as one word, Taipo, which is of course meaningless.

Quote:  <i>taipo,</i> supernatural being; goblin: used by the Maori believing it to be Pakeha, and by the Pakeha believing it to be Maori; often spelt taepo, which also is not a Maori word: so taipo is a word coined by no one knows whom... <i>taipo</i>, see the remarks following the word in list 2. There is a Maori remark that may be quoted here: Haere ra! E tama E! Mou te tai ata, moku te tai po (Farewell! O son! lit. Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence. So near is the approach of the ridiculous to the sublime.
