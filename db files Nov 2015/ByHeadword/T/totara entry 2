In Maori, the accent falls on the first syllable; but in English use it is often placed on the second, and from Mr. Polack's spelling it must have been so as early as 1840. Called also <i>Mahogany-pine</i>. There are several other species, e.g. <i>P. vivalis</i>, Hook, the <i>Mountain Totara</i>; called also <i>Mahogany Pine</i>.
