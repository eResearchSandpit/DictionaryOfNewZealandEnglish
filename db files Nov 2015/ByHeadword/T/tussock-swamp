Quote:  Hence, next to bush and swamp-land proper (on alluvial clays), Flax-land is regarded as the most desirable for agricultural purposes. `Flax-swamps' are frequently as common as `Tussock-swamps,' though their soil is far from being so wet or watery. Like the `Tussock-swamps,' they are frequently very `tussocky' - causing walking thereon to be extremely ... fatiguing.
