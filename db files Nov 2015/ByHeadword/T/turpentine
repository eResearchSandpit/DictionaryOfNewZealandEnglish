Quote:  Turpentine - Pittosporum eugenioides. This is the largest of the mapau family; it sometimes attains a height of 40 feet, with a diameter of 24 inches. The bark is thin, and of a light colour; the leaves are silvery green, and the flowers pale yellow... The bark exudes a thick gum, and the juice of the leaves, which is somewhat similar, was formerly used by the Maoris as a perfume, but I fear it is too resinous for European tastes.
