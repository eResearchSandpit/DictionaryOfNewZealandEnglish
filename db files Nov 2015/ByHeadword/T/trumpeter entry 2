Though officially recognised, the bastard trumpeter appears to be identical to the young blue moki ... On the other hand the copper moki seems to be a valid species - although referred to here as <i>Latridopsis forsteri</i> <i>ibid.</i> 247 COPPER MOKI (Bastard trumpeter) <i>Latridopsis forsteri (Latridopsis aerosa)</i> ... The body is silvery with four fine zig-zag horizontal bands of pink or olive tinged pink along the back ... They are most abundant around Stewart Island and become progressively less common further north ...
