Quote:  We know that Parliament is perceived as a place of conflict and struggle as it is evident in how our people refer to the institution with terms such as * Te ana o te raiona - the den of the lion. * Te mura o te ahi - a reference to the flash of fire on a battlefield. * Te waha o te taniwha - the mouth of the taniwha.
