Definition:with TAI PARI perhaps indicative of the change in time and place of Pakeha vernacular knowledge of Maori Williams 361 <i>Tai (i) ... Sea.: timu `ebb(ing)'</i> (he tai timu<i> `low water'); pari</i> `flowing (of the tide)'.  Both were intelligible to many English speakers up to at least the 1930s, and possibly the 1950s in the North Island, as witness the following joke first heard by me as a child in Havelock (South Island) possibly from an original King Country version; and first mentioned as early as 1845 by Walter Brodie in <i>The State of New Zealand </i>where it is attributed to Mr [?initial] Williams.

Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.

(<i>tai pakoa</i>[a1-acute]) in deep water, that he may be enabled to pursue his route at the finish of the ebb (<i>tai timu</i>.)
