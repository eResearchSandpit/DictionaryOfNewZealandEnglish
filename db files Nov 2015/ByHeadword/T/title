Quote:  Some New Zealand land law terms are uncommon  or  unknown  in  England. (Conversely the term title deeds is not much used here either by lawyers or laymen.  Instead we talk of the title or certificate of title, in the concrete sense of a document which is a copy of the registry entry in the Land Transfer Office.
