Notes: Jim writes: (In DNZE with 1902 citation... There are references to the use of house tanks before 1870 (though not the words <i>tank stand</i> or <i>tank water</i>) in Maclean.. The earliest recorded use might thus be pushed much further back.

Quote:  In the 1880s big corrugated iron tanks came on the market which were cheap enough for most households, and large enough to store water for the biggest of families. The round, corrugated tank became a characteristic of villa houses, sitting out the back on its high wooden stand hard up under the eaves, so that water would flow naturally through the outlet pipe in the bottom to the house.
