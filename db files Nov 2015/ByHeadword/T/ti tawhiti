Quote:  Among the varieties of Cordyline grown by Maoris was one, variously known as ti tawhiti, ti kowhiti and ti para by tribes of the Taranaki, Wanganui and east coast regions respectively... The lack of a documented history, the unusual dwarf suckering habit, and the observation that it had never been  recorded to flower suggested to us that Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk' could be the forgotten ti tawhiti... <i>Ibid.</i> 49 The name ti tawhiti is translated as "the ti from a distant place" or alternatively "the ti from Tahiti".
