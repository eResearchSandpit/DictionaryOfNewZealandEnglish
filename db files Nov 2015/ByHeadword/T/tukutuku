Quote:  The gate across the road into the Nga Hau e Wha Christchurch National marae is chained and double- padlocked. Behind the palisade fence the weeds are knee high. The whare nui is boarded up ... None of its carvings and tukutuku are in place and the carvings are still tapu. The whare wananga beside it, meant to house the kohanga reo, lies uncompleted, torn building paper flapping.
