Quote:  Timberbelt is a term coined in New Zealand to describe a belt of trees designed to emphasise the production of timber; they may also have some sheltering function. Utilisation of timberbelts is not yet widespread but they are increasingly evident in regions where they are being promoted (eg Wairarapa and Canterbury.)
