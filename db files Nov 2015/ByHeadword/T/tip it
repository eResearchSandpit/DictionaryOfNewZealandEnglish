Quote:  [In the Lyttelton Gaol]"Tip it' is something after the style of eggs in the bush. You have one button and some two or three fellows play another two or three. One side guesses which hand of the others contains the button. If they don't guess right it scores one against them. If they do, they take the button and the others guess.
