Quote:  We have a new word in the language. On Wednesday I heard some Lower Hutt schoolboys discussing the birthday of one of their number. When he was asked what sort of presents he'd got, the birthday boy recited a list, and about half-way through he said, "and I got some new tukus"... I look forward to the next edition of the Oxford New Zealand Dictionary, for the inevitable entry:tuku n. pl (Colloq.) 1. underpants, worn by males, usu. decorative. [abbrev. of Tukuroirangi, Maori]. 2. v. intr. (sl). 1. offer to sell an interview on a matter of importance when a Member of Parliament.
