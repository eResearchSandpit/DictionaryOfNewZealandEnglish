Quote:  The `Milk-tree' of the Nelson and Wellington colonists is described by Mr. Bidwill and Dr. Sinclair as producing a milk which is used with tea, and is equally suitable for the purpose with that of the cow; it is also drunk as it flows from the tree, and is good and sweet, but has a vegetable after-taste. - A large tree, 60 feet high, ... often extremely like <i>Carpodetus Serratus.</i> ... Nat. name `Towai', <i>Raoul. </i>
