Quote:  On the 11th of June we started from the cave, called by the natives Te-ana-o Matuku, respecting which they tell a very interesting tale of a large ngarara, a monster in the form of an enormous lizard, which formerly lived here, and devoured all who attempted to pass. Since they have become Christians, however, they have called it by another name, Te whare Taipo (the Devil's house), probably referring the formation of the cave, of which I shall speak more fully in the geological part of my report, to supernatural agency rather than to the hand of nature.

Quote:  [Mitai Tuture records] Te Maiharoa went ahead to Awakino to kill the `taipo' of that place and I think he killed two there. Taipo is the name used now but we called [47] those evil spirits atua then [c1860s].
