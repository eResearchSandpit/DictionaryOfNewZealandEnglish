Quote:  The last and hardest task (I thought) was the `tarring', as it was called. Each bag was placed in a basket, the totara bark stripped and placed around the bag for protection. Each bag was then tied securely with flax and twine, branded with our private brand and stacked in the storehouse to await the half time boat.
