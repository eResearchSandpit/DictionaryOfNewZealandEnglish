Quote:  As a teamster, Pop was required (when working the team) to have 'tight chains' from 8am until 5.30pm. That means that the harness chains had to be tight (horses working), and prior to 8am the horses had to be caught, fed, prepared - and after 5.30pm the opposite applied, so I am not sure just how long his day was.
