Quote:  The direct descendant of the tin mill is the combine harvester, or header, of today, the only real difference between the two being that the mill lacks an engine, cutter bar and self-motivation. Jim's got four tin mills but uses only two, one on each farm.

Quote:  Next to the header harvester, the `tin' mill did the mill [sc. threshing] men most disservice. This smaller style of mill came in with the tractor by which it was drawn and driven. The `tin' mill only needed seven or eight men to operate it, and its output was no more than half that of the `big' mill. But within a short time these small mills became so popular that many farmers bought their own and could thresh their grain exactly when it suited them and their crops. The `tin' mill and the `Sunshine' header thus put an effective end to the era of the mill men [in South Canterbury].
