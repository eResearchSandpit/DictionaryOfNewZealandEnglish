Quote:  Each mill employed ten or thirteen men, three breaking down the stack, then a 'turner' who set the sheaves the right way for the 'feeder,' the man who had the skilled task of cutting the binding and letting the sheaves slide down his arm into the mill at an even rate.

Quote:  The usual gang for stack threshing [c1900] was 12 men. The boss kept steam up and attended to the mill adjustments and lubrication, three men worked in the bag hole, the bag-rammer, the bag-sower, and the bag-carrier; two men were on top of the mill, a band cutter and a man to turn the sheaves to the band cutter: two men were on the stack forking to the `turner', and then there was the chaffy, two men on the straw stack, a builder and a straw `walloper' and last of all, the water joey. Threshing out of the stock required an even larger gang, usually about three more men.
