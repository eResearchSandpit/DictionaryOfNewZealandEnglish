Quote:  (in the context of a story about some female university students tidying up the backyard of their flat, 20-year-old Greta File is quoted as saying: "We'll all attack it at once, and get it all done. The lawns, a couple of car-loads to the tip and a wee tiki around a garden centre to find some plants we like."
