Quote:  The old method of tightening the chain securing the logs to trucks is called `twitching', or `taking a twitch'. First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is pased through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When the chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch'. `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `hitch'.
