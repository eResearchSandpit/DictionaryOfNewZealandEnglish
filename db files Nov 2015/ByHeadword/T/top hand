Quote:  Like most bushmen, his axe-work was a mighty necessary part of his makeup (and Old Dad was a `top hand'). If he wasn't a good man on the end of a saw - some blokes were `jockeys', they rode it - well, he wouldn't last long in the bush as far as his work was concerned ...
Notes:  (Bob Edwards, bushman)
