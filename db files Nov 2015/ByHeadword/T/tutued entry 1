Quote:  [1879 Kati Kati] Our cow, a recent purchase, was found next day staggering about, wheeling round and round in a most alarming fashion. Luckily, a half-caste passing by saw her, and said, `Your cow is 'tutu'd'; give me a sharp knife,' and promptly bled her by cutting her ears, when she fell down exhausted, but did not die, as many of our cows did from time to time later on, when having eaten too greedily of a poisonous native plant `tutu.'
