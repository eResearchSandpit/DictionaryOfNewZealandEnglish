Quote:  Recently I bought some carrots from my greengrocer.   I was indignant to find that they had been weighed with great bunches of tops, which added somewhat to their weight, particularly as they had gone to seed.   When I asked that the carrots should be weighed without this top-hamper, I was told that they had been bought from the Internal Marketing Department in that condition so they were obliged to sell them with the tops on to avoid loss to themselves.
