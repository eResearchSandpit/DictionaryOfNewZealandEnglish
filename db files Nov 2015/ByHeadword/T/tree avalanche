Quote:  I find that the drowned trees had probably come from what the Fiordlanders call a tree avalanche. Because Fiordland was so thoroughly gouged by glaciers, there is virtually no topsoil on the steeper valley sides. Even the fully-grown forest has only the precarious hold of a woven skin of roots that stretch over rock. This net has a weak grip and if one section tears free it can peel the forest from the cliff-faces in great strips. The fall of just one tree can trigger a tree avalanche.
