Quote:  "Taihoa" does not mean careful consideration, prudent and wise advancement, careful deliberation, putting on the brake, chewing things over, although it may be used for these reasons.  English-ised, this word corresponds to our own adverb 'by-and-by'- postponing indefinitely for any reason or for no reason at all what may be said or done at once.  It has always meant this and can never mean anything else, whether applied to the occasional or habitual procrastinations of a pakeha,Maori chief, or honourable Parliamentarian grievously pestered by urgent petitions of insatiate constitutents.
