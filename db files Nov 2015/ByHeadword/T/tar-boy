Quote:  <i>Tar.</i>- In the old days<i> t.</i> was always put on sheep cut by the shears. Nowadays some carbolic dip, kerosene, or Condy's is used; but it is always called<i> t</i>. When he cuts a sheep the shearer calls out `<i>T</i>., boy,<i>t</i>. on the leg', and a fleecepicker or broomie dabs the disinfectant on with a <i>t.stick</i> and puts it back in the <i>t. pot.</i> Patterson writes of `The tar boy, the cook, and the slushy, The sweeper that swept the board', but I do not think a tarboy was ever employed specially in New Zealand sheds.

Quote:  ... I was allowed to miss school to help in the shed by picking up the bellywool and removing the pizzle stains from the wether bellywool. I was also `tar-boy', which meant putting dabs of Stockholm tar on any cuts inflicted by the shearers.

Quote:  tar: Stockholm tar was once used as an antiseptic sealer on cuts, and although this has been generally replaced by improved antiseptics and special powders against flies, these new substances are still referred to as `tar'. At one time in the big sheds when any shearer called `tar' there was a tarboy to dab the cut, but now this is usually by the nearest shedhand.

Quote:  But the shearer is up and busy two or three minutes before the time, has taken his shears from the tar-boy, or "picker up," who has been practicing a little through the leisure, has given the blades a final touch with the stone, thrown the coat off his shoulders, and stripped and eager as a wrestler at the call of "time," stands at the door of his pen.
