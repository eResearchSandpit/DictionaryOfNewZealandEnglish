Quote:  <i>ma[a]nuka</i>, a shrub (Leptospermum scoparium), commonly called tea-tree, because Cook's people used the fresh young leaves infused for tea; but very often mis-spelt ti-tree - ti being something totally different, the cabbage tree (Cordyline). The tree-manuka is kanuka, with smaller leaves and smaller flowers than the scrub-manuka, and it is the kanuka that is usually sold for firewood.
