Quote:  The constant outflow of crushed quartz and water from the stamp boxes is received on a table, having on it grooves or ripples, containing quicksilver and a large extent of amalgamated copper plates smoothly nailed on. This may be called the silver table; ... The flow then passes over blanket tables, which arrest mechanically all the heavier particles. <i>Ibid.</i> 179 The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.
