Quote:  On May 13 [1867], the City Council received a report from a committee on planting, recommending planting the Belts in the following manner. A footpath, 10 ft. wide on each side of the Belt, two roadways running parallel to the footpaths, each half a chain in width, leaving 46 ft. clear in the middle of the Belt, to be planted with trees, so as to allow a 10 ft. grass-walk down the centre of each block between the intersecting streets. Each block was to be planted with one variety of tree.

Quote:  The Town Belt was originally 1500 acres in extent. It is now only about 1100 acres (430 hectares). But this is land that was supposed to be "<i>reserved for the enjoyment of the public and not to be built upon</i>"... A need arose, an itch had to be scratched, and the Town Belt was the best/cheapest/least politically-damaging option available.

Quote:  "It is indeed desirable that the whole of the town inland should be separated from the country sections by a broad belt of land which you will declare that the Company intends to be public property on the condition that no buildings ever be built on it." New Zealand Company Secretary John Ward to Surveyor General William Mein Smith, August 1839. And so the idea of Wellington's fantastic Town Belt was born... The 425 ha Town Belt, including the beloved Botanic Garden - is indeed public property - and it's admniistered by the City Council on behalf of Wellingtonians.
