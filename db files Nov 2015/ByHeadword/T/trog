Quote:  For shelter, hillmen may seek a <i>trog</i>, a large overhanging boulder or bluff giving shelter like a cave. These are most likely to be found in the south-west of the South Island, so presumably the term originated with those who frequent those parts. <i>Troglodyte,</i> a race or tribe dwelling in caves, suggests the origin. The word has been known to trampers for eight or nine years.
