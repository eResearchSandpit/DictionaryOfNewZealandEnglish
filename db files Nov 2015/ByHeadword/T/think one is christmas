Notes: ca1938 at least, in Havelock: used by older women. She thinks she's Christmas in her new hat. 1922 Heard then in Pukekoke from one who came from the Hutt Valley. Was quite a new expression to us then and I do not recollect hearing it in Auckland.

Quote:  We always used this expression of thinking someone or something else Christmas: `She thinks it's just Christmas' - meaning someone was especially delighted with something. There was no derogatory sense to it.
