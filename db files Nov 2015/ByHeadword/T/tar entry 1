Quote:  <i>tar</i>: Stockholm tar was once used as an antiseptic sealer on cuts, and although this has been generally replaced by improved antiseptics and special powders against flies, these new substances are still referred to as `tar'. At one time in the big sheds when any shearer called `tar' there was a tarboy to dab the cut, but now this is usually by the nearest shedhand.
