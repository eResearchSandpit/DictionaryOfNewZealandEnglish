Quote:  ... in each of the Canoes were two or three Cheifs [sic] and the habits of these were superior to any we had yet seen, the Cloth they were made on was of the best sort and cover'd on the out side with Dog skins put on in such a manner as to look agreeable to the Eye. Few of these people were tattow'd or mark'd in the face like those we have seen farther to the south, but several had their Backsides tattou'd much in the same manner as the Inhabitants of the Islands within the Tropics.

Quote:  The chisel was constantly dipped in a [172] liquid made of soot from a particular tree, and afterwards mixed with water, which communicates the blackness or, as they call it, the amoko

(<i>moko</i>). I observed proud flesh rising in some part of the breech which had been cut almost one month before. The operation is too painful to bear the whole tattooing at one time. They appear to be several years before they are perfectly tattooed.
