Quote:  9. Tawai, (<i>Leiospermum racemosum</i>.) This tree has a rough, dark-brown bark, and a small round leaf, in shape like that of an elm.

Quote:  We were obliged to stop a day here; and on the 6th we followed the left stream, on a flat covered with an open forest of tawai, for about ? of a mile, and as we observed that the flat did not extend any further, and that the hills descended in steep declivity towards the water, I ascended the hills with Mr. Deans and Eckford to have a look around us.
