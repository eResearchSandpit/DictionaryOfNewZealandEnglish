Quote:  Sometimes at night the rain came down in torrents, and their tents, quite ragged with rottenness, let in the cold air and wet most piteously. In the daytime they struggled through thickets of high fern, manuka and toitoi, and waded through icy flax swamps which caused them to suffer from swollen legs, rheumatism and colds. 'We surveyors as Pioneers,' wrote Samuel Stephens,'have a great deal of this tramping, and most tiring work it is.'
