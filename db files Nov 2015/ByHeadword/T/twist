Quote:  He said that accused asked them `if they could twist a drink.' Sub-Inspector: What is meant by twisting, eh? That which twists you, I suppose. (Laughter). Witness: The beer costs 4d a pot and three of us had a drink. No, I'm telling a big lie, I twisted 4 pots at 4d a pot, that's 1s 4d, isn't it?
