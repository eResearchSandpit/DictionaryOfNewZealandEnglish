Quote:  We'd attend rehearsals in Ohakea then travel in a convoy to Wellington in the Air Force's <i>'troopies'</i> (canopied trucks with double rows of seating), and were accommodated at Shelly Bay, the former naval station HMNZS <i>Cook</i> and now RNZAF territory, still with naval hammock rails in each dormitory.
