(<i>moko</i>). I observed proud flesh rising in some part of the breech which had been cut almost one month before. The operation is too painful to bear the whole tattooing at one time. They appear to be several years before they are perfectly tattooed.

Quote:  Moko is the art of latter-day tattooing amongst the Maori. The older style was called Mokokuri, and was practised by the demigod Mani, who used to tattoo the muzzle of a dog - whence dogs went with black muzzles as we see them now.
