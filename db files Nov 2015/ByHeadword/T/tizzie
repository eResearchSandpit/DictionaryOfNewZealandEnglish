Quote:  The word <i>tray</i> and its variants for `threepence' and zack fpr `sixpence' are said to be common Australianisms but are not known to me in New Zealand. <i>Tizzie</i>, perhaps from<i> tester</i>, is said to have been current in New Zealand, but again I do not know it. On the other hand, a word which Baker says is not current in New Zealand is one I have long known, <i>razoo</i>. ...

Quote:  Why, it is only half as bad as the tithe pig; and instead of a <i>tizzy</i>, they might as easily have demanded the whole <i>hog</i>. (For the information of those not acquainted with <i>pure</i> English, I may remark , that a tizzy means a sixpence; a hog, or bob, a shilling." [sic]
