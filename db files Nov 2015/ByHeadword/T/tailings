Quote:  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Quote:  When we were about Waipiata, and pushing up to Hamilton's station Ethel became very excited, and exclaimed, `The Tailings!' We were pushing through heavy gravel at the time. I looked about for a heap of lambs tails, the only kind of `tailings' I knew. The language of gold mining was unknown to me, and Ethel had to explain that tailings were the heaps of gravel left after the soil had been sluiced away.
