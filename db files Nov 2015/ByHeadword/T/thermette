Quote:  But first Ray had to set up the thermette - a sort of tall cylindrical kettle, with a hollow up the middle in which Ray stuffed some paper and kindling for a fire. The fire was lit and the water in the walls around it boiled in next to no time. `She's a New Zealand invention, the thermette: the servicemen brought it back from the war'.
