Quote:  Twitch is the name applied here to several grasses, as <i>Poa pratensis, Agrostis stolonifera</i>, and  <i>Agropyron repens</i>(the true couch or twitch). There is but one means of eradication--i.e., cultivation during summer and the careful cleaning of crops. The <i>Poa</i> and the <i>Agrostis</i> can be controlled with less effort than can the true couch. More than one season will be necessary to effect the eradication of this persistent weed.
