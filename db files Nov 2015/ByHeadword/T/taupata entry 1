Quote:  Like other coprosmas, taupata belongs to the coffee family, a fact that inspired experiments in the late nineteenth century by a Mr J.C. Crawford, who presented a sample of ground coffee made from these seeds to the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1877. 'The beans .. 'he wrote,' when roasted and ground have a splendid coffee aroma and when made into coffee the results seem to be thoroughly satisfactory.'
