Quote:  The sport turned out to be spearing trout. ... Seeing Henry's wonderment, Moses gave him a sly dig in the ribs. `These the treaty trout,' he grinned. `Waitangi, you know, the Maori own all the fish for ever. God bless the Queen!'

Quote:   `treaty trout'. A reference to the widely-held belief in a clause of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between Governor Hobson and some of the Maori chiefs, which ostensibly guarantees to Maoris the right to hunt and fish for as long as they wish in the country of which they gave sovereignty to Queen Victoria, the queen Moses blesses. Recent historical research shows that the supposed clause is not present in the Maori text that was signed, though it occurs in some of the variant English versions. ... In any case Maoris have not been exempt from laws restricting fishing and hunting.
