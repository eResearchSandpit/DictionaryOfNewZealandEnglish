Quote:  (fn) This song has a great deal of meaning : the being bereft of pipe refers to the very heavy duty which had been put on tobacco, to make the native, who was the chief consumer, pay as much as possible; but this over-grasping defeated itself. The native, unable to purchase tobacco to the extent he formerly did, began to grow it himself, and from instructions he has contrived to pick up, he now manufactures it; this he calls <i>torore</i>; some of it is so well made that there are great smokers who will give equal weight of our best tobacco for it.

Quote:  A stranger - a white man - passes through and stops to give his horse a feed; at once some twenty or thirty people turn out; and squat down in all dignity, wrapping their blankets around them like so many Roman consuls, smoke their vile burning torore (why they prefer that to our Cavendish at 8s. the lb. I can't understand), and take notes of every gesture.
