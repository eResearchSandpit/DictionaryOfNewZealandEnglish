Quote:  Some interesting botanical associations - such as toru, kauri and tanekaha - occur in the 85 hectares of coastal modified primary and secondary forest at Taupiri Bay. ... <i>Toronia toru</i>, the only endemic species of the <i>Toronia</i> genus, has fragrant flowers, leaves that can be red-tinged, and corky spots on the bark.
