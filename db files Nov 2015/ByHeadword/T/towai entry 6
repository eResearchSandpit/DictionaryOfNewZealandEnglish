Quote:  The red pines are the <i>Totara, Towa, Mahi</i>, and <i>Rata</i>, all of which are close-grained, and moderately hard. They are used principally for interior work, in house-building, and for furniture-making. They are all of a red colour, and when oiled and polished are very ornamental. ... All these red firs make good spars for ships, and are frequently used by vessels visiting the settlements. The Towa spars are considered the best for this purpose. The fore-yard of the <i>Tory</i>, a 400 ton ship, was made from a green <i>towa</i> spar obtained in Queen Charlotte's Sound, which stood many severe tests without sustaining any injury. ... The only fault of this wood is its weight, but in that respect it is less objectionable than the teak which is used for the masts of all Indian-built vessels. [43] ... The <i>Towa</i> and the <i>Kraka</i> berries also yield an useful oil, but not in such quantity as that first mentioned.
