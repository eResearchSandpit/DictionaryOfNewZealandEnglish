Quote:  The coach used at the time was a type known as a "Thorough Brace," which meant that instead of steel springs the coach was suspended on several thicknesses of buffalo leather, which ran from the front under the body to the back of the coach. These coaches were in common use throughout Australia and New Zealand in the early days of mail coaches. Leather suspension was used because steel springs would not stand up to the rough roads.
