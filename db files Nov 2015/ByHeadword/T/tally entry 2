Quote:  <i>Tally: </i>To tally is to count sheep. When counting big mobs, one man does the counting, and at each hundred he calls `Tally'. Another man keeps the tallies - at each call he may cut a notch in a stick or pick out a small pebble. The tally book contains a record of sheep counted during the year.
