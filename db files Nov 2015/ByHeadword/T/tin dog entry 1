Quote:  "... when we got home from school we would get a tin dog and drive the sheep to wherever dad said." What is a "tin dog" I asked. "Motorists, he replied carried petrol in 4 gallon cans in the boot of their car and when they were empty they would throw them in the ditch by the roadside. We would find one, put a fistful of gravel in it and drive the sheep. They were called 'tin dogs'".
