Quote:  Umbrella ferns are quite unlike any other fern. Rather than producing a typically divided frond, the midrib divides repeatedly into two, producing a bud at the end of each branch, with two new branches arising immediately below it. Lateral branching of this sort can be finite, producing a distinctive shape, as in the umbrella fern (<i>Sticherus cunninghamii</i>), or it can continue almost indefinitely, with the frond forming extensive thickets, as in the tangle fern (<i>Gleichenia dicarpa</i>).
