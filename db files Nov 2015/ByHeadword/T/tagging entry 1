Quote:  Tagging - an `unusual and deceptive' method for car dealers to woo customers - has come to New Zealand. ... Tagging involves a dealer leaving a note on a parked car, offering the owner a chance to sell the vehicle to a keen buyer. The idea is for the owner to go to the dealer's yard to discuss a valuation and sale - then buys a replacement vehicle.
