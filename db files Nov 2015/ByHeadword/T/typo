Quote:  Most sought after, in palm or rotting log, was the typo... Up t o four inches long in body and thickness, this insect is of terrifying appearance. The typo is the only living thing in the New Zealand bush capable of inflicting a painful, though non-venomous wound.
Notes:  Quoted from c1900.
