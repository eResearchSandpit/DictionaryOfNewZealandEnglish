Quote:  The formation is chiefly Upper Palaeozoic and Upper Mesozoic rocks. 244,000 acres, mainly in the back country, are covered with bush, chiefly tawhai, tawhai rauriki, and tawhai raunui, the last being found along the shores of Lake Sumner and the banks of the Hurunui River, and, with the exception of the tawhai raunui, is of little value for timber purposes.

Quote:   ... In my introductory essay ... T.W. Kirk was quoted on the singular exception in the case of the beeches, which the Maori seemed to class together as tawhai adding, perhaps, in our own manner, a descriptive modifying word or words, as tawhairaunui for the large-leaved beech. The recent studies of Dr. L. Cockayne (NZ State Forest Service, Bulletin No4, 1926), show that in this, too, the Maori was right ; the rigid specific distinction did not exist: As in Hebe (Veronica) there is much hybridization. ... and as the Veronicas were all Koromiko to the Maori, so the varieties of Nothofagus were all tawhai.
