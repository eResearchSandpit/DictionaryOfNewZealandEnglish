Quote:  His hearty salutation in its faultiness proved to be about on a par with `rummy rum', `triddy', and `toot'. The last word reminds me of a man near by who was even judged to be somewhat vain of his Maori accent and pronunciation. With one word indeed he was very particular, he could not bring himself to use that manifest corruption `toot'. With him it was ever `tutu'. He had to make rather a boggle or dodge of it when he used the colonial made verb formed on his favourite Maori noun.
