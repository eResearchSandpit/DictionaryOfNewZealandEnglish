Quote:  [<i>Notho]fagus fusca</i>,Hook. f. ... Tooth-leaved Beech. Black Birch of Auckland and in part of Otago and Southland. Black or Bull Birch of Lake Wakatipu. Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted. TOOTH-LEAVED B. <i>F. fusca</i>, Hook f. All these, however, are commonly called<i> Birches. </i>

Quote:  With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>,  tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri</i>, entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii</i>, round-leaved beech.

Quote:  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.
