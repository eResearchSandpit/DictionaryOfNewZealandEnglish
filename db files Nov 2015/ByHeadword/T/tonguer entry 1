Quote:  The now obsolete term <i>tonguer</i> was also in use in the early 1830's, and very likely before it although I have discovered no written records of it prior to 1836. A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished.

Quote:  ... it was told to me by our toungers [sic, at Cloudy Bay] that the cost [of a shore-hut] was trifling. ... I left them [sc Maoris] Came [sic] on board and despatched the boat the other side for a linguist our tounger. (The Ships all employ Tonguers [sic] and it is a general custom I have acceded on the same terms as others) On his arrival we opened the Subject but they [sc Maoris] were ashamed and finally settled that they would build the house. ...

I must not omit here Some mention of what are called tonguers. they [sic] are here 2 and 3 white people who have a boat and some natives on a ship arriving they repair on board to solicit the Job for the ship The terms are that they occasionally furnish a crew to help tow whales they furnish a boats crew to help cut the whale in and do any talking for the captain whose ignorance of the language requires their aid in any matters with the natives. When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass and the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get for [sic] 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly. [McNab's ed. fn] The Americans had ... to rely to a great extent upon Maori labour and to be indebted to the services of interpreters. These men were locally [?Cloudy Bay] called `tonguers'. ... In `The Piraki Log' [1911] the word `tonguer' is suggested as a corruption of the Maori `tonga'. This is quite wrong. The tonguer was a man who interpreted and assisted in cutting up and who was paid with the tongue of the whale.[choose between this and following citation???]

Quote:  After the ships had cut off the blubber ... the carcase was towed on shore by a crew of men, who call themselves `tonguers'. These men take off what little blubber the ship's crew have passed over, and also take out the tongue and try it all out.

Quote:  The tongue was of a white or ash colour, blackish towards the root. This organ gave several barrels of oil, and is a monopoly of the `tonguer,' or `cutter-in.' The latter operation is performed in Te-awa-iti near the shores, where by means of a windlass the whale is raised to the surface of the water under a scaffold called the `shears.' <i>Ibid.</i> 1/109 To this quantity must be added the tonguer's oil, so called from the man who `cuts-in the whale,' for which he is allowed the oil of the tongue, of the heart, and of the intestines, for his own benefit.

Quote:  The ["tonguer"]takes his name from having an exclusive right to the oil obtained from the tongue and other interior parts of the whale in payment for his duty of `cutting in', or dissecting the whale.

These men were locally [at Cloudy Bay] called `tonguers'. <i>Ibid.</i> 322 The Robinsons, so their names were given to the Doctor [Thiercelin in January 1840 at Akaroa], acted as `carcassiers', as the French called them, collecting stray floating whales, or the intestines of whales ... blown into the Bay, and melting them down to produce an inferior [323] class of oil which they sold to the whalers. Among the English-speaking whalers these men were called `tonguers'.
