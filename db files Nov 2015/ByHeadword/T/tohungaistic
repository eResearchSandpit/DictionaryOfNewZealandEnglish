Quote:  I have met with scares which.. brought home to me.. that it be a criminal offence, punishable with hard-labour imprisonment, to practice tohungaism, boast of a tohungaistic reputation, apply to a tohunga for illegal operations, and learning the incantations, for the latter is the tap root of the upas tree.
