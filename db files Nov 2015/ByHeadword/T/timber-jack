Quote:  The principal tools required [by the kauri bushman] were Yankee axes, cross-cut saws, and timber (not screw) jacks. <i>Ibid.</i> 173 (Northland) Timer jacks [are] better than scew -jacks ... The timber-jacks consist of a toothed spear, two pinions, a cogged wheel, all of wrought iron, and properly arranged in a strong piece of wood. A double handle puts in motion the gear, and the spear can be ground out about two feet with power, one man being able to lift at the handle a ton easily.

Quote:  Flotation is the method most commonly used in the kauri districts ... After the trunks are cut into lengths a `rolling-road' is formed to the nearest creek. All the scrub is closely cut down for a width of from twenty-five to thirty feet ... to obtain an approximately even surface, inclined towards the creek. The logs are forced along this road by timber-jacks, which the bushmen use with remarkable skill, and are impelled with a rapidity which is simply astonishing to persons unused to the process. If the creek contains plenty of water the logs float to the nearest booms without further trouble ...

Quote:  The bushmen that did this work were a tough capable lot - a race apart - whom no difficulty could deter, and who performed amazing feats with a few quite primitive tools. These were axes, maul, and wedges, crosscut saws, mattocks for earth work, pinching bars or crowbars, and the versatile New Zealand-made timber jack. These jacks weighed about 80 pounds and by geared cogs multiplied the man power applied to the revolving handles so that the `spear' with its two chisel points, when applied to a log, could exert a lifting pressure of 5 tons.

Quote:  Re the timber-jack:  To the best of my knowledge this wonderful instrument of the bushman is solely a New Zealand tool made in the sixties of the last century by that well-known firm of engineers, A. and G. Price, Ltd., of Thames, and later still by Messrs. Judd Bros., also of Thames, for the use of the sawmillers in the Coromandel and North Auckland kauri forests.
