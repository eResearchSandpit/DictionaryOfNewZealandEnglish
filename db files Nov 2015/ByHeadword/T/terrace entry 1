I crossed it first on the plains, where it flows between two very high terraces ... of which the most northern must be ... 300 feet high. <i>Ibid.</i> vii/96 The terraces, which are so abundant all over the back country, and which rise, one behind another, to the number, it may be, of twenty or thirty, with the most unpicturesque regularity (on my run there are fully twenty), are supposed to be elevated sea-beaches. They are to be seen even as high as four or five thousand feet above the level of the sea, and I doubt not that a geologist might find traces of them higher still.

A flat means a plain, but it is a rare thing to gallop along a flat for more than a mile without coming across a terrace, which terrace may be only six feet high, or it may be a hundred ... [and] is certain to be as regular as if it formed part of some ornamental ground.
