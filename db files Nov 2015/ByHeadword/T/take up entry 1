Quote:  I have a nine acre section, and finding I could do with another small one, I applied for it, and was informed that I could only hold one deferred section at a time. Now sir, on applying I understood by the declaration I could apply for more, as long as I did not exceed the 320 acres. On this condition, I took up the small section I now occupy.
