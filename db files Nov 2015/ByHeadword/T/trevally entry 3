Quote:  Of the sea-fishes that are used as food in New Zealand, we have among the constant residents on all parts of our coast the hapuku, tarakihi, trevally, moki, aua, rock-cod, wrasse, and patiki; and while the snapper, mullet, and gurnet are only met with in the north, the trumpeter, butterfish, and red-cod are confined to the south.
