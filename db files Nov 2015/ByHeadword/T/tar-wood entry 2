Quote:  Of the so-called pines there were many varieties, perhaps the most common being the bog pine, or tarwood (Dacrydium Colensoi) a tree remarkable on account of its exhibiting leaves of the most opposite appearance, as even on the same branch the young leaves will be found spreading in shape and half-an-inch in length, while the older ones are so closely placed that the branchlets seem to resemble strings of whipcord.
