Quote:  A fresh dog on tired sheep always has a good effect, but combined with the propelling powers of the best trucking dog of his day in Addington yards, the results were an eye-opener to this squatter and his men.

Quote:  trucking dog: a specialist dog kept by the driver of a lorry which carts livestock, and used whilst loading and unloading his crate. Undoubtedly such dogs become the most agile of all backing dogs and they quickly learn just exactly how tight or loose the dividing pens should be packed. They also need to be versatile enough to work cattle.
