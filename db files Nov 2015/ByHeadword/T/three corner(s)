Quote:  NEW ZEALAND SAND-FLOUNDER (PATIKI)  <i>Rhombosolea plebeia</i> (Richardson) ... The common Sand-flounder is known from one end of New Zealand to the other, sometimes by other names in different localities. In Auckland it is known as the Dab.../ Some refer to it as Tinplate or Three Corner; the latter name is derived from its fancied trangular shape but why Tinplate I am at a loss to know. To other than fishermen and those intimately connected with the fishing industry it is just a Flounder. Some say it is Tinplate because when cooked it fills a plate.
