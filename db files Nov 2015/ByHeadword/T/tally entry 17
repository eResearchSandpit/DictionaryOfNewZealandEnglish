Quote:  "That will do," said Brice, quite quiet; "close your shears and leave the shed." / Dick stopped swearing, took to sneering - "You don't mean it now," he said! / "I came here to get a tally, not to knuckle down to you; / You may take it how you fancy, but I mean to see them through "

Quote:  Climatic conditions, the treatment sheep have had in the months before shearing, and the breeds of the sheep all play a big part in a shearer's tally. For this reason a shearer's tally can fluctuate considerably, depending on the type of sheep he is shearing. It is a mistake for young shearers to make `tally' paramount in their ambition to progress in shearing when quality of work would have to be the first point taken into account. <i>Ibid.</i> 157 TALLY. The number of sheep a shearer does in a day.
