Quote:  In the Ngati Toa <i>pa</i> there was great indignation, and Te Rauparaha, their fighting chief, gathering together a war party, surprised and killed Te Uira and anothee Waikato chief, Te Aomarama. <i>Ibid.</i> 18 The acquisition of firearms from the whalers and flax-traders at Kapiti encouraged Te Rauparaha to embark on the conquest of the South Island. The story of these raids constitutes a perfect Iliad.
