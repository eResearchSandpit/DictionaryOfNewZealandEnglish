Quote:  The great migration (heke) from Hawaiki is the most famous event in Maori history, because all the tribes trace their aristocratic lineages back to the chiefs of the voyaging canoes. <i>Ibid.</i> 333 The smallest sociological unit is the biological family, which the Maoris termed

<i>whanau,</i> derived from <i>whanau</i>, to give birth . ... The term <i>hapu </i>(pregnancy) was used to denote this expanded family group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors ... The term <i>iwi</i> (bone) was brought into current use to include all the <i>hapu</i> descended from common ancestors and thus related to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the

<i>iwi</i> has been termed tribe and the <i>hapu</i> a sub-tribe.[check???]
