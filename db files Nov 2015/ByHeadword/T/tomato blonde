Quote:  But they drew no laughter, all soldier eyes on female nakedness itself. The dark girl, much the younger, appeared to be Nubian, though with mix of European blood to leaven swart African, so giving to velvet skin a rich midnight bronze matching densely crimped black curls tinged with deepest red. In soldier dialect tomato blondes were tuppence a dozen in the Cairo melting pot. Here in startling relief Port Said offered all-over tomato brunette.
