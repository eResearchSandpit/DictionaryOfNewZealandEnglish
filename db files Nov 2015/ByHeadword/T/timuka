Notes:  There are two plants, the karo (prickly thorn) and taramea (spear grass), which are well worthy of their names, but are almost exclusively confined to the hilly regions. There generally grows near these a plant called the timuka, from the leaf of which the natives make mats and leggings, which are impervious to the sharp points of the former.
