Quote:  <i>Toe-ragger, n.</i> In the bush a term of abuse; though curiously in one or two parts of New South Wales the word `toey,' which is derived from it, is a term of praise, a `swell.' The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel.

Quote:  `The bushie's favorite term of opprobrium `a toe-ragger' is also probably from the Maori. Amongst whom the nastiest term of contempt was that of <i>tau rika rika</i>, or slave. The old whalers on the Maoriland coast in their anger called each other toe-riggers, and to-day the word in the form of toe-ragger has spread through-out the whole of the South Seas.'

Quote:  Another old whaling term - this time a pejorative - is toe-rigger, which is the original of the still-current slang expression in Australia, <i>toe-ragger.</i> Here is what the Sydney Truth, January 12, 1896 had to say on the subject: "The bushie's favourite term of opprobrium, a toe-ragger, is...probably from the Maori, amongst whom the nastiest term of contempt was that of tau rika rika, or slave. The old whalers on the Maoriland coast in their anger called each other toe-riggers and to-day the word in the form of toe-ragger has spread throughout the whole of the South Seas.' Morris also declares: `It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland toe-rigger had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel.'
