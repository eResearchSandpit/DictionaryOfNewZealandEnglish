Quote:  TRUMPETER <i>Latris lineata</i> : Deep brown in colour on sides and back, with a yellowish belly; the brown is streaked with three, wide, whitish lines from the which the description `lineata' derives. The Maori name `Kohikohi', means `to gather here and there' and perhaps refers to the fact that a fisherman is unlikely to catch more than three or four at one time.
