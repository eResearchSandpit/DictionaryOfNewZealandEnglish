Quote:  It is the <i>Tachypetes Aquilus</i>, vulgarly called the Frigate, or Man-of-war Bird. .. Sloane, who saw these and tropic birds when he came into latitude 13deg. lOmin. says "The man-of-war bird seems very large, bigger than a kite, and black ; they fly like kites, very high, and often appear immovable over the water to wait for and catch small fish appearing on the surface ; they are sharp winged and their tail is forked.

Quote:  At most, a little lower, a snowy wanderer sails across with lightsome grace. It is the tropic bird... Looking at him near, we see he has no feet. At least, they are quite short, and webbed, so that he cannot walk or perch. With a formidable beak, he lacks the talons of a true sea eagle.
