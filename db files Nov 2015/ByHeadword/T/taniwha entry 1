Quote:  Going back a few years, I recall my first ever pig hunt. My brother-in-law had condescended to take a rather timid townie to tackle the taniwha. In my mind at least, the furtive inhabitants of the bush resembled monsters, leviathans, behemoths and the such like, in their inherent savagery and ferocity.
