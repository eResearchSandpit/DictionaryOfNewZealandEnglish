Quote:  <i>two-thirds of five-eighths of fuck all </i>very little; eg `What did you make at the races?' `Two-thirds of five-eighths of fuck all.' From the end line of the limerick:

<i>There was a young man from Bengal/ Who had an elliptical ball.

The square root of his prick/ Time seven-eighths of his grip

Was two-thirds of five-eighths of fuck all</i>.
