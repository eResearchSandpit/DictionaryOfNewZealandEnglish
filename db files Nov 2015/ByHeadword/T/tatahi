Quote:  Herekopare and Woman's Island are the only two beneficiary muttonbird islands. All the rest are Crown lands. ... I know ... that the fierce nettle also grows on Herekopare. Other lovely ... plants are there too - the Stewart Island yellow senecio, teteaweka of course, ... Cook's health-giving scurvy grass, soft native tatahi grass and punui, the giant-leafed umbrella-like araliad.
