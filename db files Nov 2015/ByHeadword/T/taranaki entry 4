Quote:  Referring to the use of the word 'Taranaki', Mr Loughnan says that it always seems to have suffered at the hands of South Islanders, who have used it as an adjective to refer to something makeshift, but which implies a definite degree of usefulness and ingenuity. The most common use of Taranaki is, of course, for the makeshift gate of wires and battens, which is a nightmare for the novice to open and shut.
