Quote:  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i>

I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime<i> deer track </i>still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>

Quote:  We followed deer tracks zigzagging up through snow totara and <i>Dracophyllum,</i> then plugged up through soft snow to Brodrick Pass (5,308ft.), taking nearly two hours from camp.
