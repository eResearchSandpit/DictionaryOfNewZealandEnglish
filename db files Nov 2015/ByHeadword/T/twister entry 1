Quote:  TWISTER <i>Helcogramma medium </i>(Gunther) The name Twister was given to this small fish for two reasons, (1) from the characteristically twisted or wavy markings on each side of the body, (2) from its amazing habit in captivity of eluding other fish, `twisting' and escaping capture when a larger fish was chasing it.
