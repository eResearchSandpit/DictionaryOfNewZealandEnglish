Quote:  On the sand at the mouth of one of [the branches of the upper Waikato at Taupo] were an immense number of ducks, toreas, and some pretty white birds. [ed. fn] This name is applied to both the

Oystercatcher ... and the Pied Stilt (<i>Himantopus leucocephalus</i>). The latter is more likely to be seen about these lakes, and is known today in the area as Torea.
