Quote:  <i>Tar</i>.- In the old days t. was always put on sheep cut by the shears. Nowadays some carbolic dip, kerosene, or Condy's is used; but it is always called t. When he cuts a sheep the shearer calls out `T., boy, t. on the leg', and a fleecepicker or broomie dabs the disinfectant on with a <i>t.stick</i> and puts it back in the <i>t. pot.</i> Patterson writes of `The tar boy, the cook, and the slushy, The sweeper that swept the board', but I do not think a tarboy was ever employed specially in New Zealand sheds. (C.)

Quote:  TAR: In earlier days a pot of Stockholm tar was kept in shearing sheds. If sheep were cut during shearing, the cut was dabbed with tar. Today this has been mainly replaced by other antiseptics, but these are still referred to as `tar.' If a shearer cuts a sheep he calls: `Tar.'

Quote:  exclam. (shearers') Proceeding just fair, but with their regularity that follows a shearer getting his back used to the arduous job, the advancement went on but with a different and a rougher cut than was usual. More frequently application of the loppies galloping down the board, to the ever increasing cry of `Tar'. The cut was becoming rougher and numbers spoilt good work, and slowly the gore of the classer, the shepherds, and certainly that of William Steuart, rose.

Quote:  A tarboy would disinfect cuts made by the shearers. He came at the cry of `Tar'. For a bad cut the cry would be: `Tar, and a bag for the guts'.
