Quote:  <i>A Tin-kettling Episode</i>: The detestable practice of tin-kettling a newly-married couple [with kerosine tins] doesn't seem to die out like other barbarities in this country; it is a relic of by-gone days. ... The origin of the custom has never been authoritatively determined and whether it is an English or purely Colonial custom ... doesn't appear to be known. However, the tin-kettlers expect the happy bridegroom to stop the din by handing them cakes and ale. ... It is only the idiotic low-class class of people who would go banging tin-cans opposite a man's house after dark ...

Quote:  `The local farmers put their heads together and planned a tin-kettling party. In the hands of people were carried an assortment of pots and kettles, wooden and metal spoons, kerosene tins containing stones as a rattle, old-fashioned car horns ... The tin-kettling was not complete until the house was circled by the tin-kettlers.'
