Quote:  PITTOSPORUM CRASSIFOLIUM (<i>Banks & Sol</i>.) ... The `KARO'.- This species is common on the coastline throughout the Northern Island ... In common with some of the other Pittosporads, it is known to the settlers as one of the `Turpentine' trees; which are probably so called on account of the gluten, in which the seeds in the capsule are immersed, emitting a peculiar odour, when expressed.
