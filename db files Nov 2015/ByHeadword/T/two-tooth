Quote:  <i>Ages of sheep. </i>Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a <i> hogget </i> until shorn. A male lamb is a <i> ram lamb </i> until castrated, then a <i> wether </i>. A female lamb is a <i> ewe lamb </i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i> shorn hogget </i> until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a <i> two-tooth </i>. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i> four-tooth, then a <i> six-tooth </i> and then an <i> eight-tooth </i> or <i> full-mouthed </i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.
