Quote:  <i>you're a trimmer!</i> a compliment or a curse; from English word `trimmer', a person who literally thrashes, meaning performs vigorously. Shepard example: `The key is stuck in the keyhole. You think you've jiggered it. Along comes your fix-it cobber and all's well. Gee, you say. You're a trimmer.' Shepard example two: `What did you move that for? I had them in the right order. Gawd, you're a trimmer.'
