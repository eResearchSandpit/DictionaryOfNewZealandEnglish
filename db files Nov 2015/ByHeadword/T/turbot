Quote:  Occasionally a large flat fish, said to resemble the Patiki, has been brought to market and sold as Turbot, but, from native information, it is probable that several distinct species yet remain to be discovered by the Pakeha fishermen.

Quote:  TURBOT (<i>Ammotretis Guntheri</i>). ... [28] In the <i>Transactions of the New Zealand Institute</i> vol. viii., p.215, Captain Hutton writes thus of the <i>Ammotretis rostratus:</i> `A fish not uncommon in the Dunedin market, where it goes by the name of `lemon sole,' agrees so well with Dr. Gunther's description of <i>A. rostratus</i>, from Tasmania, that I have no hesitation in considering it that species.'

Quote:  Thirteen species of flat-fishes are known from New Zealand waters, including a large Turbot, <i>Colistium nudipinnis</i>, which is comparatively rare, and the Megrim, <i>Caulopsetta scapha</i>, which is not popular as a food fish as it is usually very thin.

Quote:  Closely related to the brill is the turbot, the largest New Zealand flatfish. It has a reddish-brown back with darker brown splotches and is found mainly on the west coasts of both the North and South Islands, although only about 20 tonnes is trawled annually... If it is any consolation, the turbot of northern waters is a slightly different species to ours, having its eyes on the other side of the head.
