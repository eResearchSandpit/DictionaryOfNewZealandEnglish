Quote:  I. <i>Maori,</i> a. 1. <i>native</i>. 2. He wai maori; <i>fresh water. </i>

-->A. The original Maori adjectival use is recorded in early English texts(as is the substantival), translated as `native' COPPER MAORI (q.v.) would fall within this use (contrast MAORI COPPER), as would PAKEHA MAORI. -->[J.C. Andersen Maori Names p.30 notes "<i>Korari Maori</i>: Here McCrae uses the word Maori in its usual sense signifying `normal, usual, ordinary. Not until long after this time did the word come to mean what Euopeans assume it actually means, and in which the natives themselves now aquiesce - that is the name of the people, the New Zealanders. It had no such meaning in the mind of the natives until a comparatively recent date, nor was it apparently so used by them to any extent until about 1850, though Wakefield [? which one ?] and some English writers had begun the use some years before. In earliest times <i>tangata maori</i>did not mean man of the Maori race but human being as opposed to supernatural being; <i>wai maori</i> was `fresh water'; <i>Whetu maori</i> `inferior stars' Cook spoke of the inhabitants of NZ as <i>Indians,</i> early Europeam writers as <i>natives</i> or New Zealanders. [Andersen is paraphrasing Williams Dictionary here.]

Quote:  Before that can be done, we must try to remove the tap or tappers which lawless chiefs for the most part put on the principal points of rivers; they are traps in fact to catch the unwary and extort payment from them; they are, as some of the Maories said to me, only the mau mingering  of the tangata Maori, the lying for the purpose of which is to have pretexts for roads and forays, and keep the rest in subjection and slavery: it keeps the land locked up, however, and you may travel fifty to a hundred miles on the banks of some of our rivers without seeing a native.
