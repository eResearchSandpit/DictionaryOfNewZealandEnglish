Quote:  In the evening [of our wedding day: ca1898] we prepared for visitors. The number who came to the tin canning was the measure of a couple's popularity. The usual plan was for the guests to approach silently, wait until all were gathered, then to smite their tins with might and main, making a din which could be heard for miles.

Quote:  ... I suppose our [children's wedding] celebrations [c1880] were rather childish. ... We called them `tin-canning'. We [117] usually started rather late because by then the guests were fairly drunk and their reactions more amusing. Our drums were empty kerosene tins beaten with copper-sticks and the din could be heard for miles. ... Tradition decreed that red-hot pennies be thrown to us when the tin-canning started.
