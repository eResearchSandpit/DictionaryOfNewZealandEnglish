Quote:  <i>Track.</i>- Pack<i> t</i>., etc. Originally an unformed, unfenced way, but Leach's <i>T</i>., Shand's <i>T.,</i> etc., perpetuate the name. The county councils will probably alter these in time. The Bealey <i>T.</i> (to Hororata) is oftener than not called the Bealey road. `We came upon a very bad track-- that is the name by which all roads are called, and they don't deserve a better.'--S.L., p.76.

Quote:  They will no doubt be ultimately opened up by the formation of tracks and the erection of huts, and will then allow of the fullest exploitation of the winter sports attractions of the Park. <i>Ibid.</i> 25 On tracks which are little used, for instance the Upper Edwards Bush Track, much assistance could be given to subsequent parties if travellers were to renew the blaze marks so that the `blazes' attracted the attention from a distance of those unfamiliar with the district.

Quote:  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>

Quote:   ... first it was necessary to build on a flat (as the valleys here are called), not too far off the main track, on account of having to make the road to it ourselves; ... and a good creek, or brook, which would not go dry in the summer, close at hand.
