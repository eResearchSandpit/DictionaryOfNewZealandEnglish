Quote:  "I took a Trekka down to the phonebox - I ran out of petrol - to send a telegram on behalf of the Mt Eden Committee."... The Trekka became known as  "the poor man's Land Rover", and many an unfortunate motorist made the mistake of treating their Trekka as if it were a Land Rover, and came to grief when attempting to tackle rough terrain... Even so, the maker found it necessary to suggest to new Trekka owners that "if the engine fails to start ... a push start may be sufficient."

Quote:  Making the boxy Trekka the centre of New Zealand's contribution to the 2003 Venice Biennale bemused New Zealanders, as well as those who visited. ... The Trekka is an extinct fossil that led nowhere, not even to a kiwi or tuatara, which if clunky, have at least survived millions of years.

Quote:  Yes, yes, that ruffled bikini looks fetching, and you've got to love those surfboards, but the star of the picture is the Trekka - a forgotten New Zealand design classic... It's a brilliant story, New Zealand's only locally designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, the Trekka, was the brainchild of Noel Turner, a millionaire who supported Labour. The first Trekka rolled off his assembly line in Otahuhu ion 1966. It came in two colours... It had a four cylinder engine, and took 11 gallons in the tank... Turner's formula was a Skoda mechanical kit, bought at basement prices from Czechoslovakia, bolted to a simple boxy body.

Quote:  Stevenson has transformed the church into an Iron Curtain-style trade fair exhibition, taking its cue from the Trekka, the only New Zealand-designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, which was based on mechanical components from then-communist Czechoslovakia... The Trekka was the ultimate product of a mnyriad of import restrictions in the 1960s, designed to foster motor vehicle assembly in New Zealand. It was loved by those who admired it's [sic] cheap no-nonsense style as a Land Rover lookalike...  "The Trekka is a way of repsenting the idea of New Zealand as an industrialised state, an example of what New Zealand in those days could become"...
