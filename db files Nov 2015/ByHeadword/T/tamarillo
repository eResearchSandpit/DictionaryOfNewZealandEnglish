Quote:  The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally.

Quote:  Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born.

Quote:  The currency of <i>tree tomato</i> (p. 263) might also owe something to New Zealand, where the tree is well known and has always been called <i>tree tomato </i>(until in 1967 the growers decided to change the name to <i>tamarillo</i>, thought to be a better name for publicity).

Quote:  Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland.

Quote:  Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born.
