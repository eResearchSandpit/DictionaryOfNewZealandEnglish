Quote:  They [the Wairarapa Maori] probably remembered the answer given by a local chief to Te Rangihaeta in 1846, when the latter wanted Wairarapa to join him in a raid on Wellington _ "<i> Kei a wai he tahurangi maku?"</i> (With whom is a <i> tahurangi </i> for me?) <i> Tahurangi </i> was the Maori name of the old-fashioned red blankets. The wise chief knew that to slay the pakeha would be to cut off the supply of European products, hence the red blanket saved Wellington.
