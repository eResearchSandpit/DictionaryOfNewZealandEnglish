Quote:  Used 1939-1945 by Army servicemen to describe a special posture adopted by the people trained at the Central Military District school of instruction by the permanent staff instructors, and especially noticeable in the attitude adopted when making a salute or when marching at attention, as the buttocks were thrust back and the arms swung, or hung, stiffly and slightly forward as the situation demanded.
Notes:  WW2
