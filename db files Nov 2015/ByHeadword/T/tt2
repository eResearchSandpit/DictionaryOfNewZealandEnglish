Quote:  Even better news is that to do this [sc. evoke summer] you don't have to run barefoot on scalding asphalt, get caught in the undertow on some black-sanded Taranaki beach, let orange TT2 drip down the front of your togs, or spend hours removing the dear little prickles of onehunga weed from the soles of your feet.

Quote:  This gave me good reaon to browse through a rather charming book called <i>New Zealand! New Zealand! In Praise of Kiwiana</i>, by Stephen Barnett and Richard Wolfe .. The passage reads: "More fondly recalled is the alliterative and now deceased TT2, the classic ice-block of the fifties and sixties and a mainstay of summer holidays for New Zealand children. While its name was no more meaningful than the American borrowing of 'popsicle' that has replaced it, it was ours .. Apparently there was no TT1." I think it's safe to assume that "TT2" comes from the Tip-Top brand name.

Quote:  Confectionery as children now know it did not exist. The first frozen sweets were perhaps not inexplicably known as TT2s and were manufactured in sheet metal factories out of a kind of flavoured stainless steel.

Quote:  For me, the rituals of the long drop were so much part of summer, inextricably woven with the juice of TT2s dribbling down our chins and arms, black sand sticking to the residue as we sprang across the beach, our jandals flip flopping against the hot sand.
