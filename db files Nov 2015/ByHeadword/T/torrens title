Quote:  I feel I should correct [Easton's] throwaway comment on "outrageous overcharging" by government for transfers under the Land Transfer Act, commonly referred to as the Torrens Title system... However, the Torrens Title system as originally established in 1871 was from the outset intended to be self-funding and not a cost on government.
