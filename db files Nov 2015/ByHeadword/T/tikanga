Quote:  . This term refers to the customs, rules, habits and accepted ways of behaving in each tribal area, and as such may differ from marae to marae. Even within marae. one cannot know all the `tikianga' of that tribe, since aspects of life may only be known by specialists. To find out the tikianga of each marae, one should ask connected tangata whenua or knowledgeable people of the right way to enter and speak and act on that marae. To break `nga tikanga' is to invite (polite) scorn and this means a lowering of `mana'. Tikanga - see `kawa'.
