Quote:  The most widely known game with insects is a game named variously by T.C. students as Butcher Boys (Gisborne, New Plymouth, Kaponga, [405] Te Pohu, Newall, Sth. Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui). It is a game in which straws which have been suitably moistened with spittle are placed in an insects [sic] hole and are flicked out when the insect bites the end of the straw. Most of the reports of this practice come from the North Island, though it was known in the South as early as 1900 (Waikouaiti).
