The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and .. we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; .. and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.
