Quote:  To-day there was a repetition of the ever recurring blocks in the goods-shed on the wharf, the Storm having to discharge her cargo on to the foreshore again. This position of affairs is anything but satisfactory; in fact, is absolutely unwarranted, and the sooner the efforts at present being made, to have the proposed additions commenced at once, are heeded, the better for the shippers, the town, and the district, which are suffering unnecessary inconvenience by the "taihoism" of the Department.
