Notes: (from kiwianatown.co.nz) Tukutuku are intricately woven panels often found lining the walls of the Wharenui (meeting house).  These panels express ideas from Maori mythology, philosophy and history. The patterns displayed here are : Tumatakahuki (pattern either side) double/triple binding which ensures strength. Poutama (steps) has religious and educational connotations relating to levels of attainment. Roimata Toroa (albatross tears) denoting misadventure particularly to crops. Purapura Whetu (myriad of stars) relates to population and the peopling of a region.
