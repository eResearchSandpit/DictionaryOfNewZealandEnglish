Quote:  The Marist Old Boys' teams, often called "The Tikes" on account of the grim determination they exhibited in all their games, were called together by Brother Virgilius (now of Wellington) in May, 1905, when the Auckland Secondary Schools Old Boys' Unions played matches for a banner donated by Messrs Smith and Caughey.
