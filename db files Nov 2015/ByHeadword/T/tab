Quote:  The T.A.B. shop is the easiest thing in the world to use. Its straightforwardness is startling. There is no attempt to mesmerise you with jingling bells or fabulous dividends and no nonsense about weights or jockeys. ... Many patrons cannot accept this simplicity and try to complicate things for themselves by examining the charts on the T.A.B. shop walls. These are cyclostyled sheets of paper giving the name of every horse running that day together with an appropriate number by the name.
