Quote:  Thousands of people are expected to visit Waitakere City's Te Rangi Hiroa Park on March 3 for Tarara Day 2002.

A celebration of the joining of Maori and Croatian cultures on the gumfields more than 100 years ago, Tarara Day provides an opportunity for people of Croatian-Maori descent to celebrate their cultures and learn more about their heritage.

'Tarara' was the name given to Croatians by Northland Maori to distinguish them from the English.

Quote:  We Dalmatians got on well with the Maoris from the start. It was almost as if we were related, maybe somewhere back in time. The Maoris had a name of their own for us: tarara, from the sound of our speech, not unlike their own; the same broad vowels and rolled 'r's, the musical inflexion that belongs naturally to song.
