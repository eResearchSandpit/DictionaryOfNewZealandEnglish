Quote:  <i>Tussock</i>.- Up-country people only recognise the small <i>blue t. (Poa colensoi) </i>and the common yellow, usually called white t. (<i>Poa caespitosa </i>) but sometimes <i>brown </i>. and sometimes <i>yellow </i> or silver. On the other hand, some men call the blue one <i>silver </i> (rare). <i>White t.</i> includes at least two varieties, a poa and a fescue (Festuca [novae-zealandiae]). The poa is a sign of good country and the fescue is not; but five shepherds out of six can't tell them part. The dreariness of the brown tussock plains seems to have been the first thing that struck every newcomer to Canterbury. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) `In the country far distant from town, my boy,/ All desolate, drear and alone,/ Some people exist among tussocks and sheep;/ And Brittan looks after his own.' --C.RH., p. 4(2)

Quote:   The tussocks referred to are the SNOW TUSSOCK. <i>Danthonia flavescens</i> the RED TUSSOCK (<i>D rigida</i>), and in smaller amount (<i>D.cunninhamii</i>); and the `low tussocks' are chiefly the SILVER TUSSOCK (<i>Poa caespitosa</i>) and the FESCUE TUSSOCK (<i>Festuca novae-zelandiae</i>) or more rarely Poa colensoi, the BLUE TUSSOCK. The name `tussock' is applied to those tufted grasses which hold water in the decaying leaves at the base. Tall tussock is dominant in subalpine regions and low tussock in montane and lowland country, though in Southland the red tussock reaches sea level and dominates much of the landscape.

Quote:  The term <i>tussock grass</i> has been formed from the English word <i>tussock</i> `a clump' (of grass) for a kind of grass which grew in clumps. The name ... was soon shortened to <i>tussock</i>, not merely a reversal of the initial process, since it is quite possible to talk of `a clump of tussock' in New Zealand.
