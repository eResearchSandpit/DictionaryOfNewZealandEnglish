Quote:  Gilbert said that he had plenty of money as he played pool, toss the coin and won quinellas at the races. He refused to `point the finger' at where Mr Maddox got the dope. `... this has spoilt a good day. I have been raging all day. I punched him over because he tried to punch me over, and put me in my place. He reckoned he was a Liverpudlian seaman who had been here for 20 years, a big toughie,' Gilbert had told him.
