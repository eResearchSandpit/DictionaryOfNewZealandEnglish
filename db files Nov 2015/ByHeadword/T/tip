Quote:  <i>En passant,</i> no class of men ... are less generally known and appreciated than the digger. In saying this, I do not for one moment refer to those curses of a gold-field, the low Irish `tips,' for a more cowardly, ruffianly, or brutal character I have never met with than that lively specimen from the green isle, who seems to flourish with rank luxuriance in the neighbourhood of gold. He is the man who will, as long as he has a mob of his mates to back him, smash up a store, jump a claim, rob a church, ... with equal zest.

Quote:  In those days the diggings were infested by gangs of rowdies, who (whether rightly or wrongly I know not) were designated by the generic name of `Tips'.
