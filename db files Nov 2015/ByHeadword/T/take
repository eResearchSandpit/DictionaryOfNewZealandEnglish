Quote:  Down the generations it had been observed that this happened about the same time each year, so the wise old chiefs set the season for the `take' for that certain time of the year which became known to the pakeha as half of March, all of April and May, allowing no trespassing on the island at any other time of the year lest the birds, refusing to nest on an island `touched' by human presence, should fly away and never return. <i>Ibid.</i> 27 Especially when the pakeha took a Maori wife; he could then share her journey to her island, and help her to `take' enough birds for their family needs. <i>Ibid.</i> 39 Some of these descendants actually visited the disputed islands and attempted to `take'. <.i>Ibid.</i> 55-56 Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.,</i> 66 In the season 1921 the Colac Bay and Riverton Maoris caught 24,000 birds, In 1922 the `take' was 14,000.
