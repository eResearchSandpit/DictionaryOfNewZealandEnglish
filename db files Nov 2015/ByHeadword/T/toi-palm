Quote:  In spite of this warning I climbed down a steep bank to the cave, but found no bones, only a beautiful group of dragon-palms - a rare coincidence. The leaves of these <i>Dracaenae</i> - called by the Maoris tohi-palms - possess flexible fibres out of which the natives weave their waterproof rain-mats

(<i>pureke</i>).
