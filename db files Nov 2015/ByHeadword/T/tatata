Quote:  The smallest garment woven is called the <i>patai</i>[a1-acute], principally worn by females for an inner garment; the <i>korowai </i>differs but little from the former, except in having a deep fringe of knotted flax strings. The<i> tatata</i>[as-acute] is similar in size to the former, having pending from every part, an infinity of small cords six inches long, of no use or ornament; its origin must be ascribed to the arbitrary taste of fashion,
