Quote:  Sister Anderson, of No. 1 N.Z. General Hospital (Tin Town), on Wednesday, 13th, took up the duties of matron here, and is well liked. <i>Ibid.</i> 66 Brockenhurst Hospital is divided into four sections - headquarters, a collection of huts usually known as "Tin Town," and two large hotels and a hall converted. Balmer Lawn and Morant sections I visited that afternoon.
