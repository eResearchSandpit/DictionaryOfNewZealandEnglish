Quote:  Mr Highet designed his prototype of the P-class yacht about 70 years ago. It had its first outing at Onerahi Bay,Whangarei, on New Year's Day, 1920... In 1924 the boat was officially recognised in the Tauranga seven-foot one-design class.

Quote:  What is often referred to as the "Baby Class" of New Zealand, the 7-foot Tauranga boats, also owe their existence to the efforts of a Wellington yachtsman, Mr. M.H.A. Highet, who was the originator of the class. These tiny yachts, which are built on the chine principle, have a beam of 3.6 feet, and carry a single sail of the gunter type.

Quote:  The P-class is also known as the Tauranga class, because Mr Highet moved from Wellington soon after designing the yacht. The first yachts from this design sailed on the Tauranga Harbour
