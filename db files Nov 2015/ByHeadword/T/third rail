Quote:  Over at National Party Central they have developed a code for those, ahem, awkward issues. They call them "third rail policies"... National's "third rail" is not a new policy alternative but a warning to its own politicians. The third rail on a railway track is the live one, the dangerous one. Touch its political equivalent and you risk a nasty electoral shock from the voting public... The politics of the third rail are simple: avoid, downplay or defuse issues for which the majority of the public has no stomach, even if the party and its MPs think they are desirable.
