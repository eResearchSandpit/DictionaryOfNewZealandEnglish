Quote:  Cheese is bung. By long tradition this has been our tradition. Bung comes in two varieties - mild or tasty. Or soap and putty. Something to fill up on ... or to toss on the bar as counter-lunch. Come to think of it, counter-lunch is <i>le mot juste</i>, stifling as it does all desire for other food.
