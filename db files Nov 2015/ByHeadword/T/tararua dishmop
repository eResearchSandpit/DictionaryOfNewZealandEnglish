Quote:  It is unnecessary to write at length in general of New Zealand plant names, but mention may be made of the <i>Tararua dishmop</i> and the mountain mop</i>. Apparently the first is given to<i> Raoulia tenuicaulis</i>, one of the scabweeds, by Heretaunga Tramping Club. No doubt plenty of Tararuas have used it with sand or ashes to clean out a billy, little thinking that their actions might inspire a new plant name, given to it by Canterbury mountaineers apparently, from the tufts of leaves at the ends of the branches.
