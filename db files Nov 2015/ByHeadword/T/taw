Quote:  `Reverend Mother talks of when she used to give you marbles for being a good little boy - pee-wees and agates, and stonies and glassies and a big tor. And once she tried to play with you, and you said she funked because her knuckle was inside the ring.'

Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at.<i>Ibid.</i> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899]

A `taw' was usually an `alley' or `blood alley' made of agate. We used to take them home and burn them in a fire to convert them into `blood alleys'.
