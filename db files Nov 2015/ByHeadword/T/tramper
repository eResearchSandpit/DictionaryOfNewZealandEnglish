Quote:  Who were the first trampers? The first person who carried a swag and did it for pleasure and not for its own sake? What about the Maori? Did they go tramping as such or were they out for food, or greenstone, or other Maori? And what about the gold-digger and the musterer? Surely their trades came first and if they enjoyed the walk it was likely that it was because they'd found some good pasture or a `bit of the colour'.
