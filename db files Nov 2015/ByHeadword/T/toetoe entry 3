Quote:  <i>toetoe</i>, giant ornamental grass (Arundo conspicua), the flower-culms used for reed-work between the carved slabs of house-walls, cross-laced in a variety of patterns with narrow strips of flax [147] or pingao, white and black or bright orange (the tukutuku-work): very often mis-spelt toitoi or toi toi, or tohi tohi. Though the name toetoe is by the Pakeha confined to Arundo, by the Maori it is applied to various species of rush and grass with a qualifying suffix: Arundo is toetoe-kakaho, the latter word referring to the valued culms. Some people object to the reed tukutuku-work as being flimsy and perishable: in reality it is as durable as galvanized-iron and far more handome and artistic: the interior of a good Maori house is a thing of beauty.
