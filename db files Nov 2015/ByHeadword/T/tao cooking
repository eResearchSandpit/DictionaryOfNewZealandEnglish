Quote:  There are countless ways of preparing food Maori style, but basically there were only three ways of cooking it. The first, which involves steaming in a subterranean oven called an<i> umu</i> or <i>hangi, </i>is known as<i> tao</i> cooking. It was the preferred method of cooking for groups of people, from family size up, in a village setting.
