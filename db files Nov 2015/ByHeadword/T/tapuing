Quote:  Tiroa [205] returned the knife to me, after he had taken the taboo off, by rubbing it over with the gills of a fish. This strange custom of tabooing I do not understand, further than that it is a law strictly observed, & any wilful breach of it is considered a serious offense, & in severe instances punishable by death.

Quote:  The `tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of `tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge. Favourite pigs, canoes, and muskets are sometimes tabooed; burial ground is always tabbooed, and so is also a chief's head.

Quote:  When any article was fancied, the intending purchaser took a thrumb from the fringe of his or her mat, and fastened it on to the chosen article. If the selector happened to be wearing a blanket or shirt or mat without a fringe, or wearing nothing at all, as was sometimes the case, from which any tapu-ing mark could be detached, then a neighbouring flax bush, or piece of flax from a potato kit, supplied the wherewithal to affix the tapu.

Quote:  The committtee of runanga have (I hear) agreed to allow the sale of wheat, provided it never rules at a lower rate here than 5s. cash; but as they say we have been making a profitable spec. by sending timber to your market, they have stopped that branch of trade by tapuing the sale of all timber, firewood, &c., either for sale or home consumption.
