Quote:  The origin of the old name [sc. of tamarillo], tree tomato, is fairly obvious since it does indeed look like an elongated tomato growing on a tree, but although the tomato and tamarillo belong to the same family, the Solonacaea, there is no similarity between the flavours.

Quote:  The currency of <i>tree tomato</i> (p. 263) might also owe something to New Zealand, where the tree is well known and has always been called <i>tree tomato</i> (until in 1967 the growers decided to change the name to <i>tamarillo</i>, thought to be a better name for publicity).

Quote:  Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 New Zealanders always used to know the tamarillo by the rather uninspired name of `tree tomato', but after the fruit became a big export business in the 1960s, the growers decided to change the name to the far more appealing `tamarillo', in 1967.

Quote:  Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born.
