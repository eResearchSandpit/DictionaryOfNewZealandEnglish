Quote:  <i>(1) A hundred sheep.</i> When large mobs are counted the man counting calls out `T[ally].!' every time he gets to 100, and then starts again. Another man answers `T.' and cuts a notch in a stick. When the whole mob is counted the number of notches gives the hundreds and the odd number completes the total, which is also (2) called the t. 3. The total number of sheep shorn by each shearer in a day. 4. Hence <i>t.book,</i> in which the man who counts out, writes them down. 5. The <i>ts.</i> for the day before are written up each morning on a <i>tally board</i> kept in the shed. (C.)
