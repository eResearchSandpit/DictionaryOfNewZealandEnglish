Quote:  [heading] The Onslow Tar-babies. ... The name derives from a mountain-bikers' name for road cyclists. ... The Tar-babies have a "president for life", a "hunt master" to control each ride, and a self-appointed committee that meets by Internet or over a beer in the "Postie's Whistle" once or twice a year. ... The Onslow tar-babies are assembled at the old BP station in Khandallah.
