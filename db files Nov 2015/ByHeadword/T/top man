Quote:  Before preference to unionists was passed the pay [for coal workers in the Wellington Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation] was per hour for shovellers 1s 6d and for top hands (i.e. winchmen, bullrope-men, trimmers, and tippers), is 3d. .. A gang of men consists of eight - four shovellers - and four top men - with an aggregate of 11s per hour, before preference.
