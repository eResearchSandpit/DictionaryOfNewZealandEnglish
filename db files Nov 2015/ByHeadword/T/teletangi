Quote:  Because our family is scattered worldwide and some of our young people are computer literate, we used the internet to share it [a funeral in 2007] online via webcams and cellphones. This <i>teletangi</i> was the first to be done by the Maori but I think it will become crucial to keeping families connected in death and life.
