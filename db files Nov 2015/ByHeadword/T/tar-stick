Quote:  In the old days <i>tar</i> was always used to put on sheep cut by the shears. Nowadays some carbolic dip, kerosene, or Condy's is used; but it is always called <i>tar</i>. When he cuts a sheep the shearer calls out `Tar, boy, tar on the leg,' and a fleecepicker or broomie dabs the disinfectant on with a <i>tar-stick</i> and puts it back in the<i> tar-pot</i>. .
