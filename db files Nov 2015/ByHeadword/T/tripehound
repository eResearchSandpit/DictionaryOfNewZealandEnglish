Quote:  <i>Tripe-hound</i>.- Slang for sheep dog. This was common on South Canterbury stations in the 'nineties, and I always thought it a New Zealand word until I came across it in an English novel, the other day, `Early Closing,' I think. In the novel the words was applied to a spaniel! (C.)

Quote:  Among words for a sheepdog is <i>tripe-hound</i>, which I have heard used by an elderly man as an extreme pejorative for people, but it can hardly have had pejorative tone as a station word.
