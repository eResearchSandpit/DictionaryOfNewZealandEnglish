Quote:  From casual enquiries I find that a young woman, believing that the makutu spell had been laid upon her, came in to consult a noted tohungaess to have a malison removed, but recrimination ensuing the hocus pocus ended in the afflicted fiercely attacking the diviner and becoming insane, which insanity then spread to the remainder of the family of four, including the father and son-in-law.
