Quote:  The men from the Antipodes have brought with them a humour and a slang of their own. Their definition of the various batches of volunteers that have come out to fight is worth quoting. The first contingent became known as `The Tourists'. They were out to see a bit of the world. Incidentally they would do any fighting that came along. And they did it. Then came `The Dinkums' - the true fighting men as they called themselves.
