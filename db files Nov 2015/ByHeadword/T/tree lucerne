Notes: Jim writes: Both <i>tree lucerne</i> and <i> tagasaste</i> are recorded in Macquarie 1981 (there classified as <i>Ch. prolifer</i>) but not in any other dictionary I have seen. It is interesting that there is no reference to this tree in Guthrie-Smith's <i>Tutira</i>. Its naturalisation at least in Hawke's Bay is thus likely to be later than 1939.
