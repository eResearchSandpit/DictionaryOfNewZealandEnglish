Quote:  <i>tally book</i>: The official record of what every man has shorn in each run of the day. It is made after the run by checking each shearer's counting out oen before clearing for the next session. Each shearer's tally for the day is then transferred to the tally book. In earlier times a `tally board' was used with the previous day's tallies chalked up. No matter whether the book or the board is used, the tallies must be displayed in the shed.
