Quote:  There are three words in the Middle East soldiers' vocabulary describing the normal maladministration of an army. A tabu, an acrostic word, is `typical Army ball-up', a Sabu is self-adjusting ball-up, while a Nabu is a non-adjustable ball-up. <i>Ibid.</i> 207 <i>Tabus</i> had dwindled to a minimum.
