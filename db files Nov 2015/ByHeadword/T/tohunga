Quote:  It was not so very long ago that I heard these two gentlemen characterized in this Chamber as political tohungas. That term was applied to them by the late Premier, and I have not read in <i>Hansard </i>any contradiction by either of these two gentlemen of that term so applied to them, so I suppose it sticks down to the present time.

Quote:  Tawhiao, who appeared, as did the other natives present, greatly impressed with the method adopted, said if the Pakeha "Tohunga" had proposed to rectify the cast in his eye, or to change his hair from grey to a dark color, he would not have agreed, as people knew him by these signs, but that it was good for the "Tohunga" to take away the pains of his limbs.
