Quote:  In some other localities these young [smelt, <i>Retropinna</i>] are called tuarenga. The half-grown fish is termed tikihemi and the adult paraki. Certain races of fish have a broad silvery band running along the side; hence the term `silvery.' It is to be regretted that in Canterbury the term smelt is still used to apply to the minnow, <i>Galaxias attenuatus. .</i>
