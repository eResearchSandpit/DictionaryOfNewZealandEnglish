Quote:  PRICKLY SOUR THISTLE [SOWTHISTLE] (<i>Sonchus asper</i>) is also called rough sour thistle [sowthistle,] and also by its Maori name of Puwha. This is very similar to the former [S.oleraceus, sowthistle] in all respects, except that the margins of the leaves are much more prickly, ... This form seems scarcely as common as the former, though it was found in New Zealand when Cook arrived here.
