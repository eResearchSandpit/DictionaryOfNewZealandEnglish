Quote:  Occasionally unusual types of hiding games were played, for example All In or Taranaki. In this game there were two teams and a home base. One team, the `outs,' went and hid, while the home team, looked for the `outs.' As soon as an `in' player saw an `out,' he cried, `All in for Tommy Jones' (the `out' player who had been spotted). At that cry all the `in' players raced for home, and all the `out' players emerged from their hiding places and attempted to tag them. If all the `in' players could get home without being tagged, then the person seen (Tommy Jones), was considered captured, and he had to come and sit in the home base, And so the `in' team went on trying to sight players and [53] then get home without being tagged.

Quote:  <i>Taranaki drive</i> a technique used in bush felling whereby one tree is felled on to another, in order to lay a group of trees down. Unlike many Taranaki references, this one is a skilled operation, a dangerous practice that is not encouraged, except when there is the need to knock down `hang ups'. <i>[G. Johnston] </i>
