Quote:  (caption) Early view of the south portion of the town ... The tussocks are noticeable. Their removal from street lines and sections provided work for contractors, who charged so much an acre for what was known as tussocking. <i>Ibid.</i> 64 ... among them `tussacing' - the removal of tussocks from streets and town reserves.

On February 26, 1874, the council called tenders for tussocking (so spelt) the remainder of the untussocked streets south of the Puni.-->
