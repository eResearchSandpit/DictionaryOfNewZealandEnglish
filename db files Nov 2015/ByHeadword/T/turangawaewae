Quote:  For the French, and almost all European winegrowers for that matter, wine is about the land, about a piece of dirt that is turangawaewae. And you can no more separate the land from the wine than you can call a Greek a Turk, or vice versa, which is why Europe is riddled with those convoluted wine regulations that read like a dialogue for a frustrated Homer Simpson - DO, DOG, AoC, VDQS, QmP, QbA! What all these mean is turangawaewae, the place that wine calls home, and there is only one.

Quote:  Turangawaewae - this term refers to the ability to stand on one's own two feet because one belongs (see papakainga) to a piece of land which reflects one's history - one's identity. It combines therefore, the feeling of belonging and the idea of the place itself. If one loses one's papakainga, one has no turangawaewae.
