Quote:  The treaty which forms the base of all my proceedings was signed at Waitangi on the 6th February 1840, by 52 chiefs, 26 of whom were of the confederation, and formed a majority of those who signed the Declaration of Independence. This [=?, or copy of treaty] instrument I consider to be <i>de facto</i> the treaty, and all signatures that are subsequently obtained are merely testimonials of adherence to the original document.
