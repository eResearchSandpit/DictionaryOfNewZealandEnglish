Quote:   The critics will no doubt note that <i>to oozle</i> and<i> to trickle</i>, which denoted much slower modes of locomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington trampers are sometimes afflicted with<i> perspidrip</i>, or describe themselves as <i>jagged. Jagged</i> (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted, no doubt has some relation to the English dialect <i>on the jag</i>, a drunken spree, and the American <i>jagged</i>, tipsy, and also owes something to<i> jiggered.</i>
Notes:  Ruth Mason `Track and Trail'
