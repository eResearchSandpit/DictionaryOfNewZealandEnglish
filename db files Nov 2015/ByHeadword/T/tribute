Quote:  As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Quote:  And yet in June, 1928, right in the middle of the rising tide of production, the Paparoa Coal Company was forced, for financial reasons, to lay off 85 men and close the mine.

Their offer to allow the mine to be worked under tribute (which it was for several years) was bitterly opposed by the unions which claimed that the co-operative system meant the speeding of production at the expense of conditions, and that the people working in co-operative systems were little concerned about the conditions that had been built up through industrial organisation and effort over a long time.

Quote:  After being worked for a preiod [sic] on tribute, mining operations ceased, but the right to the valuable water race was kept intact.
