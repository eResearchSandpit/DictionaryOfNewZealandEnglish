Quote:  One of our calls was on a chap who had recently had a good win in the Art Union, and Dan took the opportunity to congratulate him. The result had appeared in the Invercargill paper and the nom-de-plume published was `Tinburn'. Dan of course wanted to know what prompted him to use such a curious nom-de-plume, and the proud winner said that he hadn't used that nom-de-plume at all. `Well what did you use?' asked Dan [57] `Tinbum.' Obviously the press in those days was a little more prudish than it is today.
