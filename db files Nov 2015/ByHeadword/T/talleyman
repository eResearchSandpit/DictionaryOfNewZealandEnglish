Quote:  The railway wagon, of course, has long since gone, and the fish is landed at the fish "centre": and transported rapidly to the markets in Dunedin, or elsewhere, or to cool or frozen stores , by motor transport. For many years., the "talleyman", whom the Society engaged to do just that, was an important figure. But sometime he, apparently, might have "slipped a bit", according to the minutes!
