Quote:  For years whenever we talked about Captain Cook with anyone I could never understand how we were called GBP10 Poms. One man said it's a misnomer to call us GBP10 Poms because at the time if you applied to Australia, it cost GBP10 and to Canada it was GBP10 - he said that's why he was in New Zealand, as he didn't have GBP10.
