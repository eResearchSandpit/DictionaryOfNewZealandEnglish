Quote:  At Karatia I noticed a pole with a cross bar from the extremity of which was suspended a rag ... I was told that an insane man living there had told them that the influenza was caused by the anger of the spirits of the dead and that this [134] was to appease their wrath. We were soon saluted by the Taepo (madman) himself ... addressing us in an English accent in complete gibberish.
