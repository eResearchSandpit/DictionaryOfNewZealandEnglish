Quote:  A man who has touched a very young child, or has approached a corpse, or has rendered the last sad offices of friendship for a friend, is strictly tapued for several days; and is not allowed to touch food with his hands, nor in any way to feed himself, but by picking up his sustenance from the ground with his lips and teeth.

Quote:  The `tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of `tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge. Favourite pigs, canoes, and muskets are sometimes tabooed; burial ground is always tabbooed, and so is also a chief's head.
