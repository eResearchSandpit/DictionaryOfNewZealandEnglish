Quote:  They [curing-sticks] usually carry from eight to ten plants, and are hung in the shed by resting the ends of the sticks on tier-poles. These are strong squared timber, 2in by 4in., lying horizontally, and held in position by bolting them to uprights .. If the distance between curing-sticks on the tier-poles is reckoned at 8 in., it is now possible to work out the accommodation required for curing the crop.
