Quote:  This mineral, which is double hydrous phosphate of alumina and potash, part of the alumina being replaced by ferrous oxide, was first discovered by H. Richmond, Esq., at the Sugar Loaves, Taranaki, where it occurs as thin seams which occupy fissures in trachytic rocks. It is described by Dr. Hector (Juror's Rep. N. Z. Ex., 1865, p. 423) as of a yellowish-white colour; amorphous and soft; readily fusible before the blowpipe and in other respects resembling wavellite.

Quote:  I have much pleasure in acknowledging the receipt from E.B. Dickson, Esq., of New Plymouth of three interesting geological specimens:- No.1, a specimen of granite from the Sugar Loaves, showing the formation of the newly described mineral, "Taranakite;" No.2, a larger one from an outlying reef; and No.3, a smaller specimen of the Taranikte by itself. It is probable that this substance will prove to be of some commercial value, as it evidently contains much phosphate of lime, which, for agricultural purposes, is highly esteemed.
