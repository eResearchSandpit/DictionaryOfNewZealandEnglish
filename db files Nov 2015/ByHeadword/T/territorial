Quote:  The organisation had been outlined by Field Marshal Lord Kitchener on a visit to New Zealand in 1910. All New Zealanders from the ages of 14 to 30 years were liable for part-time military training. Boys from 14 to 18 years served in the senior cadets, and young men from 18 to 25 years served as Territorial soldiers with the regionally affiliated regiments and battalions - hence the name `Territorial'. Service in the reserve was a requirement from the age of 25 to 30, but legislation allowed for this service to be extended up to the age of 55 years in the case of a national emergency. The same legislation allowed the Territorial Force to be mobilised by proclamation for service in New Zealand, and Section 26 (1) of the 1909 Defence Act made provision for members of the Territorial Force to volunteer for special service outside New Zealand.
