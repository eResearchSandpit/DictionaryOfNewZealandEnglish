Quote:  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>

Quote:  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>
