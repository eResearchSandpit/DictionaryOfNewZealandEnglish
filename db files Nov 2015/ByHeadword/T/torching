Quote:  Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.</i> 68 The `torching' season became known as such because the birders used flaming torches thick enough to be held aloft comfortably grasped in the hand. They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these `torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the `torching' and each family had their torch bearers. In most cases this duty was carried out by the children. Gradually this primitive method of `lighting the way' gave place to the European kerosene lantern and when supplies of kerosene were exhausted a lighted candle was sometimes used inside the glass globe of the lantern.
