Quote:  `Matamoe' is the term used by Wellington Maoris to refer to the adult <i>Anguilla australis</i>; but the three stages of growth are also known. The first stage, called `hao,' or `tuna heke,' is a small silver-bellied eel ... It is common in swamps and is sometimes called `swamp-eel' by settlers. The second stage is called `tahu' ...
