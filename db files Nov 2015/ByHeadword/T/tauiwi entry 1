Quote:  `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi. As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued.
