Quote:  Fonterra stands a great chance of cementing its name as one of the biggest players in global dairying as the TAF journey begins. But every shareholder must be on the journey. Leaving behind the 33.5% who voted against TAF is not an option.

Quote:  Hawera shareholder Tony Buist - the sole dissenter to the TAF proposal at the satellite meeting in Hawera two years ago - said Friday's meeting in the town was orderly, and farmers asked sensible questions. While those asking questions did not seem to favour TAF, animosity towards Fonterra was not apparent. As in 2010, he would vote against TAF which, if approved, would be compromised "pretty quickly," he said.

Quote:  Fonterra's 10,500 shareholders voted overwhelmingly more than a year ago for TAF, but in the gap between then and getting legislation to allow it, new concerns have surfaced. A petition to directors has requested another vote on TAF before the scheme became a "fait accompli".
