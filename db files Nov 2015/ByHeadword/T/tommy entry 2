Quote:  In the strict letter of the law the bookmaker can refuse to change a wager as it takes two to make a bet and two to cry it off, but I do not remember a similar case where a `Tommy' refused to accommodate a client.

Quote:  Wonder how bookmakers came to be known as `Tommies"? `Tommy [sic] is short for Tommy Rook, and probably it was owing to `rook' sounding something like "book' that caused some wag to term him as such. A rook would apply to some bookmakers, but where does the `Tommy' come in? The bookmakers were never named Tommies after soldiers, who are so dubbed, for when the latter lie on the field they've generally been shot at, whereas the bookie when he lays on the field, he's not been shot at, and, moreover, he never lays himself open to be shot at, either by marksmen or punters. Tommy is certainly a misnomer, and it should have been applied to a backer, who is ever the target for the unerring aim of the Bar Von.

Quote:  By the same token some of the bookmakers that I have known have been fearless fielders. There is a fascinating story of one of New Zealand's `tommies' who went through a very bad patch.

Quote:  The Tommies got `rats' over the Napier Park meeting. The Hutt trained Moata's successes depleting the ring of a lot of money.
