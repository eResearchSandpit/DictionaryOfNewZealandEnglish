Quote:  ``At 10 a.m. sent a party of men on shore to destroy the town and the canoes. At noon the people returned with two pigs, having destroyed the principal part of the town and canoes with fire. At 2 p.m. the people went on shore again and set fire to the remainder part of the town, canoes, huts, and all their food, and returned with one large pig and two small ones.
