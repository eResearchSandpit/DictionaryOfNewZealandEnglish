Quote:  The tribes of the Tangaroa Accord support the [Waitangi Fisheries] commission's Ahu Whakamua proposal, based on the best of tribal traditions, which is to suppress differences for the good of all... The 16 iwi of the Tangaroa Accord, which includes most tribes north of Taupo, represent more than 54 per cent of the Maori population, but these tribes will get just 32 per cent of the Ahu Whakamua allocation.
