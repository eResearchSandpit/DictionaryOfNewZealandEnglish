Quote:  I may here explain the ... custom of placing out capital under the care of an experienced manager, to be invested in sheep, or occasionally in cattle also. This is a well-known arrangement in the colonies, under the name of `keeping stock on terms', and is very general, and ... the most advisable [230] plan for persons who cannot conveniently reside on a station of their own at a distance from a town

Quote:  Everyone suggests different investments. One says buy sheep and put them out on terms. I will explain to you what this means. I can buy a thousand ewes ..., these I should place in charge of a squatter whose run is not fully stocked ... This person would take my sheep for either three, ... or more years, ... and would allow me yearly <i>2s. 6d.</i> per head in lieu of wool. This would give me <i>2s. 6d</i>. as the yearly interest on <i>25s. Besides this he would allow me 40 per cent. per annum of increase, ...; moreover, the increase would return me 2s. 6d.</i> per head wool money as soon a they became sheep. At the end of the term, my sheep would be returned to me as per agreement, ... sheep of the same age as [any who have died] would have been will be returned in their place.

Quote:  <i>Sheep on terms</i>. A favourite investment in the fifties and sixties. A man bought ewes and handed them over to a runholder whose run was understocked and who had not money to buy sheep. The runholder allowed the owner of the ewes 2s 6d a head a year for their wool and marked 40 per cent. of lambs for the owner as well; or they shared the increase equally. When the ewe lambs became old enough they were bred from as well, so that by the end of the time arranged (anything from three to seven years) the owner had a much larger mob to sell than he had started with. The practice was so much in vogue that in 1863 C.M. Ollivier published a pamphlet computing the interest and profit of <i>s. o. t.</i> at the various lengths of time. The last of such agreements at Horsley Down ran out in 1870 (H. D. letter book) and these are the latest I have found any record of. `I must confess to be fairly puzzled to know what to do with the money you have sent me. Everyone suggests different investments. One says buy sheep put them out on terms.' --[Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 37, where there is a good description of the business too long to quote.
