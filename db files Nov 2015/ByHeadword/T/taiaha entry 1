Quote:  <i>taiaha</i>, weapon of hard brown wood, up to six feet long or more, with tongue-like point and slightly-broadening balde for thrust and stroke, the tongue proceeding as if from a carved mouth, with [150] paua eyes inserted for realism: used somewhat in the manner of a quarter-staff: often adorned below the head with a plaited flax band with red kaka-feathers were ominous of victory or defeat; victory if they glowed when the protecting cover was removed, defeat if they looked dead and dull: a weapon prized as highly by the owner or collector as the mere, and much used by chiefs in oratory as well as in war.

Quote:  TAIAHA A weapon, superficially like a broad-hafted spear, but actually a broadsword. It is made of hardwood, with the `point' of the blade rounded, the edges sharp, and a carved, pointed tongue where the hilt would be on European broadsword. It is wielded in a manner that has something of the two-handed sword, the quarterstaff and the modern rifle-and-bayonet combination. The carved tongue is decorated where it joins the blade, with a collar of dog-hair.
