Quote:  I must correct you as to the origin of 'toby'. It's not Irish for road. It is Gaelic for 'spring'. My ancestors built the navigation canals in the UK. That's why they were called 'navvies' and they took the word toby with them. I'm fluent in the Gaelic, so trust me!

Quote:  My parents, and I as a four-year-old, came out from Ireland in 1921. My father became involved in a new water-supply scheme for Blenheim. In the later 1920s the `toby-box' was an item of daily reference: my father had a small supply in his shed at home. They were a cast-iron cylinder of about four inches diameter and not much greater length.

Quote:  What is the origin of the "toby". the tap that turns off water at the street frontage of a house?... I am prepared to wager that it is derived from "toby", which was the gypsy-tinker slang term for "street. There is an early link between tinkers and plumbers, both being experts with the soldering-iron, and I think the plumbers took over "toby" from the tinkers. Consequently, when they turned water off "at the toby" they were turning it off at the street.
