Quote:  A warning like the English schoolboys' `cave!'. From J. M. Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i> where Hook was always warned of the approach of the crocodile because of the ticks of the alarm clock it had swallowed. If a master approaches, the boys warn the rest with `tick tick!'. Also used in the expression `to go tick' - that is, to go on watch for masters and prefects while the rest get into mischief.
Notes:  1951 Dilworth School (McWatt letter)
