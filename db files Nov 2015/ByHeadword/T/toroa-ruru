Quote:  <i>Ossifraga ... or Macronectes ... giganteus </i>... If a birder comes near the nest the old birds move away a little and the young ones squirt a horrible smelling oil out of their mouths for a distance of 8 ft. Nellies are filthy birds that range the whole of the Southern Hemisphere and deserve their name of stinkpot. Nelly, Stinkpot. TOROA-RURU.
