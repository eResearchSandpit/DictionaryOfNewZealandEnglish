Quote:  A large quantity of wool is used in the manufacture of carpets and similar productions, and although employes [sic] are cautioned to exercise due care and vigilance to take out any tar-marked wool, they may discover, it frequently happens that tar marks in small quantities pass through the various stages into the finished goods and cause considerable damage and loss.
