Quote:  But my friends in the far north tell tales of parties going to the beach to fish, and spending their time engrossed in a game known as the Toheroa Stakes. The game is based on the shellfish's remarkable ability to bury itself and disappear in the solid sand of the wet beach. ... The game is, or was, played by drawing a circle on the beach. Each player selects a toheroa. The bets are made. On the word go each toheroa is placed on its side within the circle. The first to disappear is the winner.
