Quote:   In modern Australia ... we hear of men on up-country stations who can do nothing but `talk bullock;' and so all men did to a great extent in days when both word and idiom had origin in cattle-speech. [fn] For ancient use of expression `talking bullock' see Bible (Apocrypha), Ecclesiasticus, xxxix, 25. [HWO: Jerusalem and Vulgate references don't seem to be quite apt.]
