Quote:  The tumbler sweep consisted of a number of teeth, perhaps up to a dozen, according to whether it was a one horse or a two horse sweep... It had two curved handles and often a board to sweep the hay off when the handles were released by the driver who walked [behind. When] the handles were released the sweep turned over completely and just carried on for the next load.
