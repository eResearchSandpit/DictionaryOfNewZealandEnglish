Quote:  A combination of cooked karengo and tutu juice was fermented and used as a laxative by pre-contact Maori - though I wouldn't recommend the potion to amateur herbalists, who might find their self-healing process turns into a suicide mission, given that every other part of the tutu berry, apart from its juice, is deadly poisonous.
