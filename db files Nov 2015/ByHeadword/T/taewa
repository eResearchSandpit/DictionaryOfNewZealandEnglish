Quote:  The indigenous Maori potato Taewa could be a hot new gourmet food on menus, thanks to trials now under way at seven sites around New Zealand... At their best, Taewa are a flavoursome root vegetable in colours ranging from purples to reds and yellows, which are traditionally boiled or steamed... [The research] builds on a number of other research projects already carried out into Taewa, which have helped identify four cultivars... These are called Tutaekuri, Kowiniwiri aka Karuparera, Moemoe and Huakaroro.

Quote:  [Hdg] Maori spud seen to be money spinner. Taewa - the Maori potato - which has an important place in Maori culture, could be a money-spinner... The urenika  variety, with its bright purple flesh and skin, and the kowiniwini, with its purple and cream skin, would look a treat on any restaurant table.... It was probable the taewa arrived by ship in the mid to late 18th century and had become established by the time of the major settlement about 1840... Northland's Ngati Hine people have identified the Maori varieties karoro, peruperu, uwhiwhero, kowiniwini and urenika as possible pre-European varities.

Quote:  The accompanying sauteed watercress and pikopiko were real enough, as was the bed of kumara mash studded with pieces of tawea - the correct name for the elongated cultivar of Maori potato known crudely as tuae kuri (and if you don't know the meaning of that, I'm not telling, except to say that kuri means dog).

Quote:  A research project to re-establish taewa - Maori potatoes - as a sustainable commercial horticultural crop has received $100,000 from a new Technology New Zealand fund for Maori collectives. Taewa have been grown in New Zealand for centuries, forming the basis of the market garden industry established in the 1800s to supply early European settlers.

Quote:  You say potato, I say taewa. The commercialisation of the Maori potato, or taewa, has been a long-term project for researcher Nick Roskruge. In July a hui was held for marae groups who now grow taewa semi-commercially, feeding their families and selling the surplus... There are more than a dozen varieties of taewa, some purple-skinned, others with mellow yellow flesh.
