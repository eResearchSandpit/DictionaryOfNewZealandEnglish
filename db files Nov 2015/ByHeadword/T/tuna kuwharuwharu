Quote:  Today the eel population in the Wairarapa is under stress and none more so than the largest species - the majestic Tuna Kuwharuwharu.  Tuna Kuwharuwharu are one of New Zealand's most ancient inhabitatns but have decreased in number so rapidly that they are now nearing endangered status.    So it's extremely special to see a large number of female tuna kuwharuwharu being fed at Pukaha Mount Bruce which occurs daily at 1.30pm.
