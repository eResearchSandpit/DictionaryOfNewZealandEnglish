Quote:  ... all the men he phoned were fixd [sic] up except this young chap, just out from England who was staying at the Club. ... He seemed a decent sort of chap - quiet - a bit stand offish like most of these English `Tommies'. [This passage is crossed out.] [fn 164] `English Tommies": like the phrase `English Johnny' which Mansfield used in her story <i>Millie</i> in 1912, this is presumably a contemporary New Zealand expression for a recent immigrant.
