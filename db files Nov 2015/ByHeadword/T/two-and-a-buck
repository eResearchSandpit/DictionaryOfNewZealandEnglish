Quote:  The crown was called a<i> bull</i>, a <i>cartwheel</i>, a <i>caser, five bob</i>, and most familiar of all a <i>dollar</i>, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is <i>Oxford scholar,</i> the derivation from dollar being obvious.

The half crown was called a <i>half-dollar</i>, a <i>half-bull, half-caser</i>, <i>two-and-a-kick,</i> and <i>two-and-a-buck</i>. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only <i>two bob</i> being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.
