[<i>Pittosporum eugenioides</i>] it is often cultivated for its beauty, and is sometimes - though not so often as<i> P. [195] tenuifolium </i>- used to form an ornamental hedge. It is known by a variety of names amongst the colonists, such as <i>Mapau, White Mapau</i>, and even <i>Maple</i>, and <i>Lemon-tree.</i> The Maori name seems to have been <i>Tarata</i>, but it is also called the <i>Mapau. </i>
