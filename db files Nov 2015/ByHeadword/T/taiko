Quote:  `Taiko' is the name for any large muttonbird, once abundant on all mountain ranges from the Waitakeres to the Rimutakas of the North Island. In the `good old days', each Maori village had it own taiko colony, which was visited in the autumn to collect the fat `titi' (young birds).

Quote:  In a military-like operation, telemetry operators in tents on hilly vantage points around the Tuku Valley pick up the signals of taiko returning from the sea... For all the hours spent in hot pursuit of taiko, just one or two burrows are found by the end of the operation... Going on taiko expeditions was the "thing to do" for birdwatchers in the post-rediscovery days, says Mr Cotter.

Quote:  The first steps have been taken towards the creation of a new colony of Chatham Island taiko, with the translocation of eight chicks to a predator-free area on Chatham island. Taiko are considered a critically-endangered species, with fewer than 15 pairs breeding each year and a total population of approximately 100-150 birds.
