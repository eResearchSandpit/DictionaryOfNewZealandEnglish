Quote:  On emerging from Pamaki [a's-acute], we ascended another plain of some miles in circumference, covered with fern and bush, above which the tupakihi [a-acute], or native elder-berry, occasionally shewed its bending stem, yielding to the weight of the fruit, which hung in purple clusters. ... The natives, on perceiving me make use of this berry, warned me not to swallow any of the seeds, as the doing so would make me <i>ourangi</i>, drunk, or mad. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/134 The flexible tu pahihi [prob ?typo see 288] (elder berry) with its pensile clusters of ripe fruit ... <i>Ibid.</i> 1/288 The <i>korai, koutu utu, miro,</i> and <i>putuhutu</i>, are wild forest fruits, prized only by the elder natives.

So that `tupakihi,' the name by which the `tutu' is there known, appears to be a contraction of `tutupakihi,' or `tutu' of the [196] plains, which are well called `pakihi,' being for the most part arid.

Quote:  These tracks twist in and out all over this lonely country, through the high fern and the glossy green tupakihi with its black clusters of elderberry-like fruit, and the thickets of manuka that in springtime are showered with delicate white blossom till they look as if a snowfall had powdered the face of the country, and diffuse an aromatic fragrance that is the most insistent of the grateful odours of the bush.
