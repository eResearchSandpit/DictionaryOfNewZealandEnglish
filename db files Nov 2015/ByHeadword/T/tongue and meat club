Notes: ca1952 R. Mason A contemptuous nickname for this club which assumed the all-inclusive provincial title though only the fourth or fifth oldest in Wellington. Now (1952) used by W.T.M.C. members themselves. At a meeting of the Wellington Association of Mountain Clubs a member of the W.T.M.C. can be a `Tongue and Meat'.

Quote:  <i>Tongue and Meat Club</i>, that name bestowed on the Wellington Tramping and Mountaineering Club by the scarcely sympathetic members of fellow clubs when it first adopted its present name, has become so established that a W.T.M.C member may now introduce himself by saying `I'm a Tongue and Meat'.
