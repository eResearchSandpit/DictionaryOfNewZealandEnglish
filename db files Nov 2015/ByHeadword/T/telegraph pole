Notes: Jim writes: This is defined in Chambers and Macquarie in the literal sense of a pole supporting telegraph wires. There is not entry in Collins. NSOD refers to "telegraph or telephone wires". In NZ the term was widely used informally also in relation to electric power lines (=<i>power pole</i>) (I cannot remember ever having seen telegraph lines in the strict sense). Does this loose use persist?
