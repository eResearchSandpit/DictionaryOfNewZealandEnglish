Quote:  The titiwai (stars in wet places) of Waitomo, which means water entering a shaft, have been celebrated since 1887, when they were first explored by local Maori chief Tane Tinorau. The insects feed ravenously as larvae, then briefly emerge as adult fungus gnats to mate, lay eggs and die within three days.
