Quote:  <i>tiki</i>, flat carved greenstone image worn on a cord round the neck, particularly by women: a charm for fertility, being a rough representation of the human embryo. The name in full is heitiki, hei signifying anything worn round the neck; and the tiki being the chief object so worn the hei has been dropped. The tiki is highly valued, and genuine ones can rarely be obtained; fakes are plentiful.
