Quote:  SUCKLING CLOVER (<i>Trifolium dubium</i>) was formerly named <i>T. minus</i>. Alternative common names are yellow suckling clover and little trefoil. it is common in pastures throughout all the sown grass lands and even where no sowing has taken place. Its seeds pass unharmed through sheep, and are therefore scattered wherever sheep can travel.
