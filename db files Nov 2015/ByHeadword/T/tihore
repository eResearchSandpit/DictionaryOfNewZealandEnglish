Quote:  CORRESPONDENCE. NEW ZEALAND FLAX. .. First and foremost is the <i>Tihori.</i> This is the stoutest and best kind. It is known from the others by the extra substance of its leaf, and by a red tinge on the edges. This is the sort the natives select for cultivation, as it is the easiest to clean.
