Quote:  Happily, there is not at present any decided New Zealand accent, but certain very objectionable expressions are current, and by no means only in the <i>sermo plebei.</i> I have heard this, or variants of it, quite frequently:- First decently dressed youth: `Well, how's things?' Second decently dressed youth: `Oh, jest like this, yer know.' First d.d.y.: `That's right!'
