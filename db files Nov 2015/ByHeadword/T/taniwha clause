Quote:  The perfect symbol for all this is the Meremere taniwha. This one-eyed spirit stopped work on a new highway.. and gave National leader Bill English a new slogan. A reference to the Treaty in new legislation became the "taniwha clause" - a phrase coated in political poison... Historian Michael King says the issue "has nothing to do with the literal existence of non-existence of taniwha. Taniwha are a metaphorical way of saying that place is either dangerous or has special spiritual or historical significance. The way Maori signified  that was by talking about taniwha or guardian to make poeople respect it and to explain the fact that sometimes people disppeared or drown or whatever, in those places".
