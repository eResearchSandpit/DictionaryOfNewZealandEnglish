Quote:  A prostitute is not called a tart by Cockneys, because `tart' has always meant a girl. It is a street word, not used indoors, but it is not coarse or unpleasant. It conveys a well made up, attractive girl. One might say `Who's that ginger-haired tart,' or `Harry was talking to a tart', or even `your tart' - though the last shows a poor vocabulary and would be said only by children. The term has been going strong for at least seventy [83] years, and probably derives from something like `jam tart'; given that, why should a reference to colourfulness and sweetness be offensive?

Quote:  Your correspondent, in Tuesday's issue, tries to explain the meaning of the words, "Jam Tart."   I fancy that his brain must have been in the same haze that your own dear brain was, respecting the sense of the term.   I real meaning of the name, both from a confectionary [sic] and social point of view, is a thing with a great deal of puff, but with very little in it.

This was principally owing to the fact that invitations were limited to lady friends of the members only. However, a few of the opposite sex - on whom the "jam-tarts" occasionally bestow a passing notice - managed to gain admittance.
