Quote:  `The consensus seems to be that the object is a pit-candle holder. There are different names for them in Australia and New Zealand where they're known as pit spiders or in New Zealand only as tommy sticks,' Mrs Hall said. She said many old miners or children of miners had rung her to identify the object.

Pit-candle holders were used with carbide lamps in mines. The pointed part was put into the pit prop with the hook hanging down. The candle was put through the hoop.
