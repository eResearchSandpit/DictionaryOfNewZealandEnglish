Quote:  The stipulated grade for "tagged" potatoes is of a higher standard than that of the fair average quality grade operating for shipments from the South to the North Island. Complaints regarding inferior grade of "tagged" potatoes are investigated by a committee of the association, the association having authority to deprive offenders of benefits and even membership in the case of deliberate faulty packing .. to establish confidence on the part of purchasers in respect to the quality of "tagged" potatoes, and incidentally to command for their produce a premium over other potatoes.
