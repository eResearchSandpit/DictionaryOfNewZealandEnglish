Quote:  <i>That'll be the day,</i> a way of expressing a strong disinclination to do something, was unknown to visiting Americans during the war, one of whom thought it expressed gay anticipation and answered `That'll be the day' when asked to visit a New Zealand family. The expression was worked to death and in its dying agonies produced some contortions as <i>That'll be the frosty Friday</i> etc.
