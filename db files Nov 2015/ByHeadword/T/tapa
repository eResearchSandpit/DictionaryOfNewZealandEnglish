Quote:  There was a kind of variation on the <i>tapu</i>, called <i>tapa</i>, of this nature. For instance, if a chief said, `That axe is my head', the axe became his to all intents and purposes, except, indeed, the owner of the axe was able to break his `head', in which case, I have reason to believe, the <i>tapa</i> would fall to the ground. It was, however, in a certain degree necessary to have some legal reason, or excuse, for making the <i>tapa</i>; but to give some idea of what constituted the circumstances under which a man could fairly <i>tapa</i> anything, I must needs quote a case in point.
