Quote:  [Title] Tararua Biscuits. A New Zealand mountaineers' staple, one of these biscuits lies buried in the Himalayas, on the summit or Yerupaja Norte. The gesture was the brainchild of Graeme Dingle, who was the first to conquer the mountain in 1968.

Quote:  Among the authentic local baking-terms the one I find most evocative is the Tararua biscuit. It comes in high-fibre high- calorie slabs... Two generations of Wellington dentists must have made a tidy income from its inroads. I must be one of the few of my old Mt Holdsworth gang with my own teeth, since I only once tackled a Tararua biscuit and I must confess I did not take it straight.

Quote:  A classic lunch food is the Tararua biscuit. This is any sort of home-baked biscuit baked out of a mixture of rolled oats, flour, golden syrup and other ingredients, and formed into a hard flat biscuit that acts as a base for butter and spreads. The principle of Tararua biscuits is that they serve as a replacement for bread on long trips. ... The taste is not a crucial matter, but they must be firm and filling - and all of the same size, otherwise bickering will develop over who's got the biggest.

Quote:  While on a hunting trip in the Grebe Valley the other weekend, we bumped into some members of the Peninsula Tramping Club and (I think) the Over 40s Tramping Club at Clark Hut. I peered over their shoulders and noted that their lunches included good old Tararua biscuits and one person had boiled eggs ...

Quote:  Among the authentic local baking-terms the one I find most evocative is the Tararua biscuit. It comes in high-fibre, high-calorie slabs generally baked by young males in secret when Mum is watching TV. Two generations of trampers swear by its life-sustaining qualities and two generations of Wellington dentists must have made a tidy income from its inroads.
