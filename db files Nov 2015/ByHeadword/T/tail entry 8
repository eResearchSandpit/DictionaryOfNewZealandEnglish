Quote:  Suppose a piece of timber - a flitch nine inches by twenty-four and sixteen feet long - is on the carriage, and that we intend cutting nine by three-quarter boards. After taking off a `face' cut, setting the gauger rollers, and placing the flitch in position, the man at the head starts the machinery. `Kreash,' says the saw. and in twelve seconds she is out at the other end. The man at the `tail' at that instant reverses the motion of the table, which gigs back.
