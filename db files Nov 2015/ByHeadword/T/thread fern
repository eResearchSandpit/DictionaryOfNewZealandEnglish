Quote:  Climbing ferns are much less dominant in New Zealand bush than in tropical rainforest, but mokimoki (<i>Microsorum scandens</i>), <i>Rumohra adiantiformis</i> and thread fern (<i>Blechnum filiforme</i>) are common throughout, while jointed fern (<i>Arthropteris tenella</i>) and mangemange (<i>Lygopodium articulatum</i>) are characteristic of the warmer northern forest. The thread fern is an unusual plant, beginning life on the ground where it scrambles around until it finds a trunk to climb.
