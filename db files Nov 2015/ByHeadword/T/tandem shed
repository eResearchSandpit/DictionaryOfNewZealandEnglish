Quote:  There are three commonly used types of milking shed in New Zealand - the walk-through, the tandem and the herringbone. ... [149] The walk-through shed is strictly a New Zealand invention. ... It was born of the ingenuity of farmers faced with the task of milking large herds on their own, or with little help. ... [150] The herringbone is a New Zealand development of the tandem type. ... In this type of shed the cows are angle-parked in two rows separated by the milking `well' which is thirty inches below the cow platforms.
