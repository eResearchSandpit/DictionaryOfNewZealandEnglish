Quote:  The Golden Kiwi established partly to prevent sent money being sent out of New Zealand for tickets in Tatt's, a Tasmanian lottery with a name abbreviated from Tattersall's and quite unconnected with the English cant word <i>tatts</i> `dice'. It was illegal to sell tickets in Tatts' in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which was universally understood. . . .It was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.
