Quote:  By 1900 these [bucking a rider off one's back] games had faded out of regular school playground play. But out of school, we can assume that these games were still played occasionally. For example, a version of Buck Buck ... under the name Jumbucks is played today by one of New Zealand's tramping clubs (hiking clubs) in its haunts near the snowline.

Quote:  The Tararua Tramping Club held its adjourned meeting last week when a draft constitution and set of rules were submitted and adopted.
Notes:  Couldn't find similar report in Dominion. Both reports of the first meeting call it simply the Tararua Club and do not use the word "tramping" in the report. I think this is probably the genuine first occurrence of the combination in print.
