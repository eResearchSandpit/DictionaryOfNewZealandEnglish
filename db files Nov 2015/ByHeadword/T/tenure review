Quote:  It's called "tenure review", an unremarkable term for a remarkable transformation now taking place in our legendary South Island high country. In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand.

Quote:  High-country farmers are quietly opting for tenure review because many are likely to become wealthy from what is [7] one of the best real estate deals in New Zealand in the last 50 years... I suspect that history will judge tenure review as not such a great idea for farmning or the public... What should have happened is a careful review of the pastoral lease system to maintain this unique form of land tenure, with adjustments to assist farmers to diversify and to protect uneconomic land.
