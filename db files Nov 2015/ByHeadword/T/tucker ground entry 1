Quote:  It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

Quote:  This is abundantly proved by the testimonials which have been received from time to time, which in some instances afford striking evidence of the changes wrought in the productiveness of the soil by the application of the latest thing in plough, drill, or harrow, causing areas that were formerly, in digger parlance, only "flash tucker" ground, to yield a harvest equal to the most fertile.
