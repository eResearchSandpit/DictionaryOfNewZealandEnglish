Quote: Zamzoid. This word was noted - believe it or not - in what has come to be regarded as something of a New Zealand classic, Robin Hyde's  The Godwits Fly. ... Thereafter it was easy. My English Dialect Dictionary swiftly produced an adjective sam meaning `half-heated' (of food) and an adjective sammy meaning `Soft, clammy, sticky'. I was clearly on the right track for those imperfectly washed forks. A further scan produced (in various phonetic spellings samsawed, samsawdered, samzawed,  sam-zawey) a clutch of examples of past-participle/adjectival forms all with the sense of `lukewarm' - used of food that has been cooked and then laid aside until it has begun to coagulate into a sticky mess.
