Quote: For example, when a girl's dress blows in the air, boys will claim they have seen a `poppy show'. This is a widespread term. Another indirect sexual play is the universal practice of `zipping' amongst boys. In my experience, this is practiced [sic] more by boys in the 12 to 15 year age group than by primary school boys. In this play, boys attempt to rip open each others [sic]trouser flys.
