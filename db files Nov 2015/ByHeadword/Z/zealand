Quote: A party about emigrating to New Zealand begs most respectfully to solicit the assistance of Government in their undertaking. I am (with several who have resided on the island) convinced an English colony would soon become flourishing and happy ... One thing I must beg Your Lordship's most serious attention to - that is, the heavy duty (1/- per foot) on timber imported into  N.S. Wales from Zealand
