Quote: A few trade names have caught the public fancy, and become generalised. Thus Zambuk, a brand of ointment, is regularly used for `first aid man' (usually a member of the St. John's Ambulance Corps), or even as an appeal for first aid.

Quote: Amanda Stephens.. is curious to know why St John ambulance people are called "zambucks". The term was originally applied to volunteers who attended sports meetings and public events, but it has come to mean any St John workers, including those who attend accidents. It springs from the decades-old first-aid practice of rubbing a product called Zambuck Oil onto the sore bits of injured footie players at matches.
