Quote: Our nearness to Australia also resulted in our adoption of  slang words in use there. Examples of these include goldie for sovereign, and little goldie for a half sovereign. A colonial robert  is obviously a play on the English slang bob for a shilling. (Colonial robert was in use in New Zealand before the turn of the century, and was also recorded about the time of the first World War.) (Otago Witness 24 Jan. 1912:32) Along with the Australians, New  Zealanders used zweideener for the florin (zwei meaning two),  and zack for sixpence.
