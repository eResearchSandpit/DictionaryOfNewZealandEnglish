Quote: The zigzag plant has eluded conservation workers for more than a decade but one long ranger's persistence paid off and a botanic treasure has been uncovered. Believed to have died of old age, <i>Muehlenbeckia astonii</i>, a rare shrubby tororaro, was found.. on the rugged coast between Fitzroy Bay and Cape Turakirae at Baring Head... The plant is recognisable because of its lime-green heart-shaped leaves and tangled zigzag branches.
