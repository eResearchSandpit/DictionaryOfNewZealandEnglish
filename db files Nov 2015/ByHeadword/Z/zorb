Quote: Zorb is an invented word for a wacky tribute to New Zealand ingenuity. Essentially, it's a giant double-skinned plastic ball in which thrill-seeking punters at <i>Zorb Rotorua</i> are secured by harnesses and sent rolling over and over 170 metres downhill. Then there's the wet Zorb experience - akin to tossing yourself into a frontloader washing machine on gentle cycle. A bucket of water is sloshed in, the entrance is plugged and, as the Zorb rolls, the challenge is to stay standing by running, damply, on the spot.

Quote: The many activities here include a farm show, jet boat and helicopter rides, the Zorb - a large clear ball you sit inside and roll down a hill - and the Swoop - a harness that allows you to soar through the air.
