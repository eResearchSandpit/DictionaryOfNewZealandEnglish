Quote: [Hdg] Zorbing not for the pink-knuckled... New Zealand has contributed the terms zorbing and black-water rafting. Zorbing is an entertainment where those taking part are suspended inside giant plastic balls and rolled down steep slopes. Black-water rafting is the pastime of floating along pitch-black underground streams in inflated inner tubes.
