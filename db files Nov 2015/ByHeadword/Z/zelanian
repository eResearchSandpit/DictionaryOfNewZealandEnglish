Notes: 1. Dr Laurie Bauer, who pointed out the entry in Chambers to me, received the following information from xxxxxxx, who works with the Chambers Dictionary: 2. The Chambers informant writes:`There seems to be/have been some doubt about the existence of the New Zealand subregion in any case. It appears in the article on `Distribution of Animals' in the New World Encyclopedia (New York, 1903), but not in the Encyclopedia Britannica (1910-11). Of a non-geographical use of the word, implied by Webster's and Chambers, I can find no trace.
