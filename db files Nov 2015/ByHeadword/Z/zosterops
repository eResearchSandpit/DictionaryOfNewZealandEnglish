Quote: .. to say nothing of Korimako and Pitoitoi ..., we never saw or heard the notes of either the Piopio, the Tieke, or the Hihi, all of which birds were at one time more numerous even than the Huia. The  <i> Zosterops </i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

Quote: <i> Zosterops </i> ... the scientific name of a genus of Australian birds, often called also popularly by that name, and by the names of  <i> Wax-eye, White-eye, Silver-eye ... Ring-eye, Blight-bird </i> ... From the Greek, . . . a girdle, `anything that goes round like a girdle'; the birds of the genus have a white circle round their eyes. The bird was not generally known in New Zealand until after  <i> Black Thursday </i>	 (q.v.), in 1851, when it flew to the Chatham Islands. Some observers, however, noted small numbers of one species in Milford Sound in 1832. New Zealand birds are rarely gregarious, but the <i> Zosterops </i> made a great migration, in large flocks, from the South Island to the North Island in 1856, and the Maori name for the bird is `The Stranger'  <i> Tau-hou </i>). Nevertheless, Buller thinks that the species  (<i> Z. caerulescens </i> is indigenous in New Zealand. (See under <i> Silver-eye </i>, quotation 1888.)
