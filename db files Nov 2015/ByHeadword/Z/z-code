Quote: Alert has a Z-code system for drivers and phone room staff. In theory it saves time on the airwaves -- in practice many of the old time drivers are sceptical of speaking in z's. Sample `conversation' between driver and base: `Car on the Oxford.' `One eight.' `It's a z 10 one-eight. Collect 12 z 4's for the TAB in `K Road.' Translation: The despatch has asked driver one-eightparked on the Oxford rank to do a job for which there is an order number. He's to collect 12 parcels from the Central Post Office and take them to the Totalisator Agency Board Karangahape Road! (Strict translation of z 4 is `non passenger'). There is also a special z code number meaning `possible attack on driver' - if a driver radios to base that `this looks like a z' - everyone hears is on the alert.
