Quote:  When the Canterbury Museum party was landed there it was with some puzzlement that we watched the two helicopter crews (6) and a total of 5 'jolly riders' disappear to the four corners of the nunatak.  [9]  Although I have not visited the crater personally, I have heard from New Zealanders working there that American helicopter crews and 'jolly riders' seem to have an unfortunate habit of scooping up (sometimes with shovels) the crystals of Anorthoclase feldspar that are left around the vent after eruption.
