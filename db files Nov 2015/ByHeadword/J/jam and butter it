Quote:   jam and butter it! as mild a curse as `darn it!', but can be used in mild or mean situation; Shaepards suggest you are in a tearing hurry to catch a waiting bus, you grab the supposedly locked cashboxes, one in each hand, and head for the safe, and the lid comes open on one, out falls a trail of coins ...; a milder example: the cook says, `Oh jam and butter it, I forgot the spice!'
