Quote:  Numbers of Americans who spent sufficient time in New Zealand found themselves adopting a word from which escape is almost impossible. It is  none other than joker ..... New Zealanders, however, have given it a wider meaning; a joker is simply a man, and he is not necessarily a humorous fellow ..... Thus a New Zealander will say, `Who's that joker?' ...... This word crept in to the vocabulary of many Americans Down Under, but they will forget it when they settle down at home again. The American use of the word guy has exactly the same meaning.

Quote:  A man. Note that `joker' is synonymous with `bloke' but not with `cove' or `johnny, `geezer' or `so-and-so'. Unless among friends, or in a question, it is invariably qualified; unqualified, it often implies comradeship. .in 4;`I don't know what you jokers are doing, but I'm going in for a drink.' `What sort of a joker is the new man? He seems a friendly sort of chap.'  `As far as us jokers go, we'd rather give you the price of the ticket, than have to dress up and go.'  `Not the sort of joker `I'd care for a mate.'  `A nasty joker.

Quote:  Among colloquialisms, joker (32)[per 500,000 counted words in Queensland] in the sense of `man' is not confined to Australia, though more frequent there than in England. In the Queenland count  it was less common than chap (409) or bloke (176), but it would be likely to rank higher in New Zealand, where it is very common not only alone but in the phrases  you jokers and a decent joker (a  general term of approval). It is used (repeated as he) as an equivalent  of an absolute indefinite pronoun, corresponding to standard one. `They ask one if one is serious' becomes `They ask a joker if he is serious'. With a negative verb it replaces no one. `No one can remember everything' would be colloquially `a joker can't remember everything' '
