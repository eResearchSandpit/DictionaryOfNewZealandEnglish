Quote:  Darren Hughes was able to offer a personal endorsement for a Levin clothing factory's imaginatively titled underpants when he accompanied his boss, Prime Minister Helen Clark, to the plant this week. 'I can report to you personally, prime minister, without getting too up-close and personal, that these 'jewel bags' are very good things,' he said.
