Quote:  Only four vehicles were in use on the island up until this time but by 1952 over 100 were in use. [59] Before the coming of motorised transport, the mode of transportation was the `Chatham Island Truck' (Konake), a wooden flat-decked horse or bullock-drawn vehicle, with iron or wooden wheels at the back and sledge runners on the front. Also in use was the `jogger' a cartlike vehicle with two pneumatic-tyred wheels, seating about three people and drawn by two horses attached to a shaft. They worked on the principle of the African Cape Cart. The pole (shaft) was attached to the collars of the horses. Tom McClurg of Te Whakuru made the first `jogger' in Chathams, about 1940.
