Quote:  At present, there is much debate over the issue of exactly which factors contribute to our sense of national identity. Forget about beaches and the bush and the Buzzy Bee and the jandal: how about the candy banana? Or the chewy milk bottle, the Jaffa, the spearmint leaf, or the fabulous coconut mushroom.

Quote:  The assocviation's Bill Hood puts it down to the development of "consumer-friendly" multiplexes, where you not only have six movies to choose from, but plenty of linked attractions close by, eg restaurants, bars, food malls and video parlours. Gone are the days when an Eskimo Pie and a packet of Jaffas had to do you at half-time.
