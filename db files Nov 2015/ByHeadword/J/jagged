Quote:  The critics will no doubt note that to oozle and to trickle, which denoted much slower modes of locomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington trampers are sometimes afflicted with perspidrip, or describe themselves as jagged. Jagged (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted, no doubt has some relation to the English dialect on the jag, a drunken spree, and the American jagged, tipsy, and also owes something to jiggered.
