Quote:  Two of them [in the hydro gang Waikaremoana] were drinking methylated spirits, which they called `metha' and `Johnny Gee' ...The first few nights [at Waikaremoana hydro camp], Starkie was out of tune with his bedmates, for two of them were drinking methylated spirits, which they called `metha' and `Johnny Gee'. ... `I knew a joker went blind drinking that metha. They put stuff in it to keep you off drinking it.' <i>Ibid.</i> 190 They [sc Maoris] drink a lot of metha, don't they. Great names they've got for it - Phar Lap, and Johnny Gee, and White Light. There's one old Maori down here who went blind, drinking the metha.
