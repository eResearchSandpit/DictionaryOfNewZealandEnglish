Quote:  JinkZ.er (j&ibreve.nkZ.&etilde.r), n. A two-wheeled or four-wheeled contrivance much used in the bush for carrying long trunks of trees.  In the four-wheeled jinker the hind wheels are much larger than the front pair and the two axles are joined by a central longitudinal beam, under which the tree trunk is slung by means of chains. The two-wheeled jinker has a bow-shaped axle, to which one end of the trunk is slung, the other being allowed to drag on the ground. The

jinker, slightly modified, is sometimes used for moving wooden buildings.

Quote:  [Notice on exhibit] LOGGING JINKER Often referred to as a logging arch, it was occasionally

used as another method [besides the catamaran] of moving logs but was not popular on steep grades having a tendency to overrun the bullock team. On flat land however this method was quite satisfactory as the near end of the log dragged along the ground and acted as a brake. ... Jinker restored by Mr Reg Poyner
