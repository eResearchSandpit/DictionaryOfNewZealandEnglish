Quote:  The word jet conjures up connotations of speed and fast travel. It's also the acronym for Jersey Elite Testing, Jersey New Zealand's innovative breeding concept .. As the scheme gains a profile, people will start saying 'yes, she's a JET heifer - she's worth more.' .. He [vet Lindsay Chitty] said those who designed JET chose to use heifers rather than older animals because they had the potential to make the most genetic gain.
