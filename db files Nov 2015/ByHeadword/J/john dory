Quote:  ``John Dorys' are found in the Mediterranean, on the eastern temperate shores of the Atmantic, on the coasts of Japan and Australia. Six species are known, all of which are highly esteemed for the table. The English name given to one of the European species (<i> Zeus Faber </i>) seems to be partly a corruption of the Gascon `Jau,' which signifies cock, `Dory' being derived from the French Doree, so that the entire name means Gilt-cock. Indeed, in some  other localities of southern Europe it bears the name of <i> Gallo </i>. The same species occurs also on the coasts of South Australia and New Zealand.'
