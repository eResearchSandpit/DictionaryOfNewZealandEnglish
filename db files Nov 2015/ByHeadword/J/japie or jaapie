Quote:  I am intrigued by the word "japie", sometimes "jaapie" which is often used in New Zealand for South Africans. I have asked South African expatriates about the word and their theory was that it stemmed from a characteristic pronunciation of "yeah", a word they often use. Some believe it is an ironic pun on "yuppie".



In Afrikaans, the name Japie is a diminutive or affectionate form of Jaap or Jacobus.. In everyday use, a japie is a dolt or simpleton. It is often used together with the word "plaas" as in "plaasjapie", which means a yokel or country bumpkin... If the word is South African in origin, "jaapie" would be the wrong spelling. The "a" as in japie is a long vowel.

Quote:  Perhaps we shouldn't forget that New Zealanders often use the term Jaapie to describe a South African, as they would a Pom for an Englishman or a Yank for an American. Yet the expression Jaapie is an insulting term when used in South Africa.
