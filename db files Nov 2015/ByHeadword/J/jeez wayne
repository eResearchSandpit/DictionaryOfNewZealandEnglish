Quote:  "Jeez Wayne". <i>A Week of It</i>, 1977: because a new national expression made its debut around a pub leaner in a television satire and straight way took its place beside other historic moments in TV... "It started out as 'jeez', and when we got a name it became 'jeez Wayne'... A quarter of a century after it entered the lexicon it's still alive and well. Ask any Wayne. Jeez.
