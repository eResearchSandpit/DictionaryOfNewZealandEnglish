Quote:  J.A.Lee in his Children of the Poor (1939) mentions the game of knocking on doors. It was known also as Tip Tap (1885; Waikouaiti). Another widely known trick was Jingle the Penny: `We tied a string to a penny with a hole in it, then hid behind a hedge or on top of a verandah. As a person stooped to pick it up, we would whisk it away' (1895; Ngakawau).
