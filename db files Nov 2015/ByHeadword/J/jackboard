Quote:  Jackboard: A six-foot-long board (6x2 ins), drilled with two rows of holes of inch-and-a-half diameter spaced alternately three inches apart vertically, and used to lift the arm, with the drifter attached, up the column. The board was put in front of the machine and the sank-end of a long drill-steel placed in the hole just above the underside of the arm; the drill was then lifted upwards from the rear side of the column and the procedure repeated until the correct height was gained.
