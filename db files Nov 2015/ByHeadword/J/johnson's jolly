Quote:  From `Walker's': Does anyone know the real origin of the name `Johnston's Jolly,' applied to a certain artillery position on the right of Anzac Front. I have heard two suggestions: (1) That

`Jolly' is an English word, meaning to `deceive' and `take down,' and that the position concealed guns which made havoc of the Turks. (2) That `Jolly' is a corruption of an Indian word - a case similar to `Blighty.'  Anyway, who was Johnston? The only facts which seem to be agreed on are that the place was never `Johnston's,' and certainly never `jolly.'
