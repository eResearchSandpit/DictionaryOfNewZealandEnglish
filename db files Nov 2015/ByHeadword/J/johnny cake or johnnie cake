Quote:  And he in less than half-an-hour/ Had such a pile of Johnnie-cake,/ That on the embers he did bake/ ... And went down with a relish high,/ With steaming tea and liver fry; -/ And that by men

[sc. shepherds] so much in need/ Was well pronounced `a glorious feed'.

Quote:  Johnny-cake The name is of American origin, originally given by the negroes to a cake made of Indian corn (maize). In Australia it is a cake baked on the ashes or cooked in a frying pan. (See quotations.) The name is used in the United States for a slightly different cake, viz. made with Indian meal and toasted before a fire.
