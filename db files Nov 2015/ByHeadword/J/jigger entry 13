Quote:  Kendrick Smithyman jigger or alternatively joker, the top section of a (kauri) gumspear. The `spear' was a metal rod sharpened at the tip ... topped by a wooden handle of a spade or shovel,

the handpiece and section of (part of) shaft being hafted to the blade. The length of the spears varied from (say) 1 metre to something up to 3 or 4 metres, for sounding/probing for swamp gum. ...
Source: historic photograph caption on information board at an archival gumfields site cared for by Lands and Survey ... I imagine it's a very local usage.
