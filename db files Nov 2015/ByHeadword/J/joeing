Quote:  The Tuapeka gold-field is under the charge, as I have said before, of Mr. Alfred Chetham Strode, gold-fields commissioner, a gentleman who appears to be highly popular among the miners, a feeling demonstrated somewhat by his uniform exemption from the `joe'-ing with which everyone else clad in decent apparel is greeted.
