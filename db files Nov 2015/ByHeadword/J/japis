Quote:  ...National leader, Don Brash, may have spawned another acronym with his unflattering description of New Zealand in the <i>Australian Financial Review</i>. Running down Kiwi workers, the economy and Government policy, the former banker said he feared New Zealand was turning into "just another Pacific Island state". We just hope japis doesn't stick.
