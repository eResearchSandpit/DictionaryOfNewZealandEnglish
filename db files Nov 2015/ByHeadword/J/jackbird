Quote:  It has become the habit to speak of this bird as the Brown Saddle-back; but as this is a misnomer inasmuch as its absence of saddle is its distinguishing feature. I have accordingly adopted the name of Jack-bird, by which it is known among the settlers of the South Island. Why it should be so- called I cannot say, unless this an adaptation of the native name `Tieke', the same word being eguivalent in the Maori vernacular, to our `Jack'.

<i>Native name</i>.- Tieke. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/23  It has become the habit to speak of this bird [<i>C. cinereus</i>] as the Brown Saddle-back; but this is a misnomer, inasmuch as the absence of the `saddle' is its distinguishing feature. I have acordingly adopted the name of Jack-bird, by which it is known among the settlers in the South Island. Why it should be so called I cannot say, unless this is an adaptation of the native name `Tieke', the same word being the equivalent, in the Maori vernacular, of our `Jack'.

Quote:  The Story of the saddleback would not be complete without some reference to the mystery which for many years surrounded the so-called `Jack-bird'. This bird, once thought to be a different from the saddleback, is of the same size, but of a uniform coffee-brown colour. One writer has likened the colours of the saddleback to ink and cocoa respectively, and that of the `Jack-bird' to the colour of ink stirred into cocoa! It has now been established that the `Jack-bird' is really a juvenile saddleback in its first year plumage, and that later the full plumage and larger cheek-wattles are developed. This applies to the South Island saddleback only; since the first edition of this album was published it has been discovered that the North Island saddleback is a distinct sub-species and has no `Jack-bird' plumage in its juvenile stage, but has the saddle from the time of leaving the nest.
