Quote:  A Christchurch resident rushed hurriedly into Prohib. Isitt's tract emporium Colombo-street t'other day and asked for Norton's `Truth'. `Give us a "Johnny",' he said, producing three coppers. Isitt rolled his eyes with horror. `Norton's "Truth"! I wouldn't touch it with a forty-foot pole!' he exclaimed... -->ibid. 136 (Millie) He was Harrison. He was the English johnny who'd killed Mr Williamson.
