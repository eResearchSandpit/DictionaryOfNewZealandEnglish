Quote:  [picture caption facing] 109 Mud-trained horses have no trouble hauling these Chatham Islands joggers over the boggy countryside. [a pneumatic-tyre car-wheeled trap or dray.] <i>Ibid.</i> 145  Horse and ox are still the principal means of haulage, and the islanders have invented a conveyance that overcomes the worse features of the bog - the so-called jogger. This is a cart-like vehicle with two pneumatic tyres - something like a rubber-tyred Roman chariot - drawn by two sturdy mud-trained horses.
