Quote:  After that chance discovery every spear was equipped, at a few inches from the point, with a coil of fine wire, known as `the joker', securely fixed. [to enable the spear to go into the ground easier, and traces of bodies touched to be brought to the surface for examination].

Quote:  The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep

swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum.

Quote:  jigger or alternatively joker, the top section of a (kauri) gumspear. The `spear' was a metal rod sharpened at the tip ... topped by a wooden handle of a spade or shovel, the handpiece and section of (part of) shaft being hafted to the blade. The length of the spears varied from (say) 1 metre to something up to 3 or 4 metres, for sounding/probing for swamp gum. ...
