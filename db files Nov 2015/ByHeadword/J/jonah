Quote:  Jonah - Originally this referred to anyone who brought bad luck to a ship. In Perano whaling practice, it mostly referred to an `outsider', `stranger', or `non-whaler', who was deemed to have brought bad luck to their whaling. The Jonah might be blamed for the non-sighting of whales. Jonahs were never welcomed at the Perano whaling lookout, or on board any Perano ships. Not all strangers were regarded as Jonahs; some, in fact, who helped bring good luck were credited with being good omens.
