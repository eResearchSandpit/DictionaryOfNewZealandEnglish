Quote:  Even though women are working as hard as men and should feel no guilt about sitting back and enjoying a well-deserved Jimmy Woodser after a hard day at the plant, there is still considerable stigma attached to the female imbibing.

Quote:  The self-respect that was in him has departed, and knowing not when he will get another, he drinks deep of what he lays his hands on, and deteriorates into a Jimmy Woodser and absorbs his liquid with the flies, and sheds any small remnant of rectitude that he might have had about his clothes.  A new species of Jimmy Woodsir has been reported as having blossomed at a Clutha DRY DISTRICT benefit football match.

Quote:  Jimmy Woodser.-A correspondent tells me that James Woods was a shearer on the Darling

River, New South Wales, in the 'eighties. He spent the off-season in Bourke. He was fond of a glass of beer but was never known to shout. He always drank on his own, so that when the shearers saw anyone go to the bar by himself they always said he was having a  J.W. Hence the saying.
