Quote:  As [the diggers] descried us approaching on the rocks, a simultaneous cry of `Joe! Joe!' was raised. This is a popular cry on the New Zealand diggings and is used to hail any `new chums' who may appear. It had its origin in the Australian diggings, where licences were granted to all who held claims, and those who worked without were liable to be apprehended and punished. When the police came upon the ground, to inspect licences, the cry of `Joe!' was raised, and whenever the pass-word was given a thousand voices echoed the cry, until it passed over the fields, when those who had no licences made their escape as quickly as possible.

Quote:   In the early days if the Australian diggings `Joe!' was the warning word shouted out when the Police or Gold Commissioners were seen approaching, but it is now the chaff for the new chums [in Dunedin] <i>Ibid.</i> 188  Several men working on the roads [in Taranaki] shouted `Joe' after us; but as we knew the meaning of this joke they did not get a rise out of us.

Quote:  More passengers were picked up along the road, and one of them, a returning digger, enlivened the trip by calling out `Joe' to any passing new chum, followed by a series of kind inquiries, and wound up with a loud laugh. The term was originally applied to the goldfields police in Victoria, who made themselves unpopular hunting for licences.

Quote:  As this was the first time such a thing had been attempted on those diggings, I had to undergo a tremendous fire of `Joes' from every chum I passed. The word `Joe' expresses the derision usually bestowed on new chums on the diggings, or any man acting, or dressing, or speaking in any way considered as outre [e-acute] by the diggers themselves. ... Times getting dull about the Six-mile, I was joined one by one by many others, several of whom had been among the first to `Joe' me at the beginning.

Quote:  No sooner had he left the store than the diggers caught sight of his bell-topper and began [31] greeting him with cries of `Joe, Joe.' The township was soon ringing with the cry. The minister was puzzled to understand why he was being barracked so freely and asked Thomas the reason.
