Quote:  There two varieties of this pre-adamite looking bird, the king or crested penguin which is the largest, and the jack which is much smaller and for more numerous. ... The jacks are captured in hundreds by the sealers who salt them down. [1957 f.n.] Crested  Penguin (<i>Eudyptes pachyrhyncus</i>). The name `King Penguin' is not correctly used here. `Jack Penguin' = Blue Penguin (<i>Eudyptula minor</i>)
