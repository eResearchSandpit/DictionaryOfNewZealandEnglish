Quote:  I refer to the claim that the jandal was "invented" by Maurice Yock in the mid 1950s. He may have made up the name and trademarked it, but he did not invent the footwear. The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal.

Quote:  Jandal, like champagne, like Hoover, should never be used as a generic term. Jandals, flip-flops, thongs - they're all a ghastly sort of topless shoe hitched to the foot with a piece of rubber between big and second toes, but call a common thong a Jandal and you're in for trouble with the Napier company holding the trademark. Jandals were born in the 1950s, an adaptation of casual slip-ons worn by the Japanese team at the 1956 Olympic Games.

Quote:  They've been an icon of Kiwi slobbery since the '50s but in the summer of 2001, the jandal has become a hot fashion item, far removed from the grubby rubber models sported by beer-gutted blokes at barbies.... [Maurice] Yock, a New Zealand sales rep who worked for his grandfather's company, was travelling around Asia in the late '50s when he spotted a style of footwear in Japan. The "jandal" - from "Japanese sandal" - went into production in a garage in Te Papapa in 1957, and Jandals Ltd was born, a brand name specific to this country.

Quote:  For the jandal, that local instiution, is as Kiwi as ju-jitsu... It is a sole and a strap. The sole has an off-white veneer. The underside is anaemic blue or anaemic red. So is the strap. That strap is stamped with a crude motif and is held in place by three little plugs. And that's it. The lot. The jandal.
