Notes: (railwaymen's):  R. Mason notes (p.c.); came across but did not note different terms used for this in England and the U.S.. Jigger invariably used in NZ; CC Ransom notes: The US layman's term is hand-car, but most have motors now; and the railwaymen's term is doubtless something shorter.  Contrast trolley.

Quote:  The old days, when maintenance of the line was carried out by small gangs of surfacemen living in tiny groups 11 or 12 kilometres apart and travelling up and down the track on hand-pulled jiggers, were dead. Motor trolleys made them more mobile and most of the repair work was now done by gangs sent out from Christchurch in a bus; only at a few strategic points like Cass and Arthurs Pass were there any permanent staff.
