Quote:  I consider Davy has done a foolish thing in selling his farm. ...I am glad it has not, as usual fallen into the hands of the `Jimmies' usurpers of the soil, but into those of a man who intends to surpass in improvements, anyone in the place.

Quote:  `I never wanted to leave England,' I have heard an old Vandemonian observe boastfully. `I wasn't like one of these `Jimmy Grants' (cant term for `emigrants'); I could always earn a good living; it was the Government as took and sent me out.' [The writers probably used the word immigrant, which, not being familiar to the English compositor, was misprinted emigrant. The `old Vandemonian' must certainly have said immigrant.]
