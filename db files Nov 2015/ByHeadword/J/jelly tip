Quote:  Was it to be a seat in the stalls, (9d) and a half time Jelly Tip (1/3), or luxury in the dress circle with a bit less to eat?  Sometimes he was lucky enough to turn up with 2/6, (half a crown), so he could sit in the circle with Jelly Tip and a packet of Snifters too!

Quote:  [English] Frozen food retailer Iceland has used a "secret formula" to come up with what it describes as a strawberry-flavoured non-melting lolly that doesn't drip or dissolve - it just slowly turns into a jelly that stays on the stick... Secret perhaps to anyone who hasn't ever lived in New Zealand, where the Jelly Tip ice-block has been world famous since 1951.
