Quote:  There are plenty of Hansoms and all sorts of other conveyances, but I gave [12] F-- no peace until he took me for a drive in a vehicle which was quite new to me - a sort of light car with a canopy and curtains, holding four, two on each seat,  dos-a[acute]-dos, and called a `jingle,' - of American parentage, I fancy.

Quote:  JinZ.gle (j&ibreve.nZ.g'l), n. [Add.] 4. A kind of public vehicle, common in Melbourne about 1860-80, but now obsolete. The jingle was a two-wheeled car drawn by one horse. The front seat accomodated the driver and two passengers; the back seat carried three passengers, back to back with those in front, with their feet on a narrow footboard. The whole was covered by a tilt.

Quote:  The public used to go there [Vauxhall Gardens] either by boat or round the  head of the bay by `jingle,' as the omnibus cabs then [c160s] plying in Dunedin were called. [18] These jingles were ugly, uncomfortable vehicles, having two wheels with a long axle, over which was built the body, containing two seats running parallel with the axle each capable of holding four persons. The whole was surmounted with a clumsy roof held up by supports at the sides, and attached thereto were curtains which could be let down in wet weather. The seats were placed back to back, and the seat in the rear was reached by a step in the middle of the footboard.
