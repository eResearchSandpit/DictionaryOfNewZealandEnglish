Quote:  The working faces going towards the rise were too steep to push trucks up, hence the double road, called a `jig'. A jig-prop was put in close up to the face around which a chain or steel rope was passed and connected with the full trucks at the top and the empties at the bottom. The full truck was pushed over and so hauled the empties up.
