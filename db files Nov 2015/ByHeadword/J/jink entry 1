Quote:  Thus, the game of Tig (known as `Tag' in the United States) is always remembered, though its innumerable forms may not be. On the other hand, some informants claim that they never played Tig in its present haphazard forms, but only in a circle (in Cat and Mouse or Twos and Threes formation), `with the mouse running 'round and `jinking' the cat by getting another player between herself and that cat-player' (1874; Tahataki). ... In Tig round the school, you `jinked' and turned back. We played it to warm us up, but it was a dangerous game. (1860; Taieri)
