Quote:  Regent and Opera House, St. James with all those layers, tiers, remember, Princess and Shorts on the corner and magnificent Jaffa-rolling, De Luxe with the silver curtain.
Notes:  A reprehensible amusement much favoured by adolescent theatre-goers in the 30s and 40s which was particularly effective on sloping floors.
