Quote:  Judas goats are proving a strong ally in DOC's quest to remove feral goats from areas of conservation land in the Wellington region. In a first for Wellington Conservancy, goats fitted with tracking devices were released into Pukaha Mount Bruce and parts of Tararua Forest Park to sek out goats which have eluded DOC goat hunters and their dogs... Since the operation began late last year seven judas goats have tracked down 14 wild goats in the western Tararuas...

Quote:  The 'Judas' goat is fitted with a collar that has an antenna attached. It is then lowered into the forest by helicopter and because goats are social animals the Judas goat will find other goats. Later, the hunters' [sic] return by helicopter to the area and, using radio equipment, locate the Judas goat by picking up the signal from its antenna. The helicopter drops a hunter and dog on the ground to track the goats and shoot them.
