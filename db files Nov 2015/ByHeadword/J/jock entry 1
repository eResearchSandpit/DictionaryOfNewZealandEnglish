Quote:  When a race is going uphill, a short piece of railway iron pointed at the end is hooked onto the last box, hanging down like a tail. If there is a mishap and the race begins to move backwards, this device digs into the ground and by derailing the boxes brings the whole race to a standstill. It is known as the jock, the northern form of jack, a term used for a variety of mechanical devices, the most familiar being the one that raises your car off the ground when you need to change a wheel. Jock and jack are simply dialect variants, one northern, and the other southern.
