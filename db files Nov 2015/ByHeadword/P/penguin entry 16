They are flightless, but their wings are modified into powerful fins or flappers. Among the most interesting forms are the following - the King Penguin, <i>Aptenodytes longirostris</i>; Rock Hopper P., <i>Pygoscelis taeniatus</i>; Yellow-Crowned P., <i>Eudyptes antipodum</i>; Crested P., E. pachyrhynchus; <i>Little Blue P., E.</i> minor <i>and</i> undina.'
