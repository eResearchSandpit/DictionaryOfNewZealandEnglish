Quote: [Our Brigadier] seems to resent my asking for information and for not too readily allowing my men to be plunged ahead without reconnaissance and information. <i>Ibid.</i> 52 I had heard that a `plunge' attack by 100 men of the Mounted Rifles had been ordered by Headquarters for a couple of days ago. A mad fatal thing. It was to be a dash across open ground commanded by machine guns ... to the Turkish trenches and then back.
