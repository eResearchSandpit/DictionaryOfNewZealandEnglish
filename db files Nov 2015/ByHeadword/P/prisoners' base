Quote: Others wanted [to play] `Prisoners' Base' or `Chivvy', `Brewer', `Egg-in-the hat', `Duck-stone', `Red Rover', or `Kingy-seeny'. The boys did not know where this last game came from. They did not know its proper spelling or pronunciation. `Kingy-seeny' it was to them and they did not care whether that had a meaning or not. This rough and tumble game was the most popular of all.
