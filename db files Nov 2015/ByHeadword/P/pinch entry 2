Quote: Up that old route across the range,/ I've met with swaggers quaint and strange,/ And with them up the pinches toiled,/ And sat by creeks while billies boiled,/ And yarned until the sun had gone,/ Along the road to Erewhon./ <i>iBID.</i> 135 Another thing I noticed was that the old road in the hilly parts, seemed to have led up needlessly steep pinches, and along the crests of wind swept ridges.
