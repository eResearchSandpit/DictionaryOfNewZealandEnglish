Quote: Mr. Fyfe had found a moa's egg, at the Kai Koras, while digging the foundation for his store. It is a foot long, about 6 inches in diameter, and 27 inches in circumference. The shell is the 16th part of an inch in thickness. A hole is drilled in the end of it, and the egg must have been considered of great value by the natives, as it was found deposited at the head of a skeleton, with a number of very large poenamu axes. Mr. Fyfe, we understand, is going to send them home to the British Museum.

Quote: Among the Maori, considerations of aesthetic interest helped quite materially .. to decide the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu</i>, the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the <i>inanga </i>variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, 389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. .. <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest.
