Quote: [Hdhg] Plum plus apricot equals pluot. Plums and aporicots are coming together nicely at Ray Anna's Marlborough orchard  - as pluots... The sweet, juicy fruit, are predominantly plum, with a slight "fuzz" on the skins and an appreciable apricot flavour and texture. They were developed by Californian company Zaiger Genetics 11 years ago using an intricate method of hybridising.
