Quote: ... the fact remains that in some localities [the non-epiphytic rata <i>M. robusta</i> [contrast <i>M. florida</i>]] are frequent enough to attract the special attention of the bushman, who calls this form the `inland pohutukawa', a designation he also bestows upon symmetrical specimens of true pohutukawa sometimes found in the forest.
