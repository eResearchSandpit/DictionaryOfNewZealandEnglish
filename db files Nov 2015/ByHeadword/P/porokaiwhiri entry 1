Quote: (from the <i>Australasian</i>) .. The yellow clusters of the spreading dark-leaved pura-pura .. the little fiery branches of the red porokaiwhiria; the rich luscious berries of the kotukutuku, or giant fucshia, whose flowers hang side by side with ripe fruit, and unopened buds. All these, and many another fruit of the woods, fell upon the warrior's path, and allayed their hunger.
