Quote: ...why is a boss in New Zealand sometimes referred to as a pannikin? I can't pin down the answer to this one. A pannikin is a small drinking vessel used by workers. The expression "pannikin boss" was first recorded in 1911, in the <i>Maoriland Worker</i>: The 'pannikin' boss ... is the man who for a wretched shilling a day more than his fellow unionists sells his body to a mercenary employer to rush, wear and sweat others."
