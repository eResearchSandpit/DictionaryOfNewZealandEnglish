Quote: I am a Pakeha New Zealander, which I can explain and define with certainty. I was born and raised in New Zealand; my ancestors, going back at least five generations, were born and raised in New Zealand. My first ancestors, as far as I can tell, came from England. This is what it means to me to be a Pakeha.
