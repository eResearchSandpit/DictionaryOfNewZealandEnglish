Quote: There can scarcely any New Zealand household without a bottle [of tomato sauce], whether sheepishly tucked away at the back of the fridge ("I only buy it for the kids") or given pride of place inside one of those red plastic tomatoes, with a brownish dried clot blocking the spout, the sides dented with the thumbmarks of the last person who squeezed it.
