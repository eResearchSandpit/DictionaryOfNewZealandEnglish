Quote: <i>Probationary Assistant</i>-New Zealand student teachers normally do two years' training in one of the country's Teachers' Colleges. During this time, they work about five separate monthly practice periods in selected schools. Their third year of training is as Probationary Assistant in a larger school. If this probationary year's service is satisfactory, trainees receive their Teacher's Certificate, and are then eligible to apply for a teaching position anywhere in New Zealand or in New Zealand's Island Territories.
