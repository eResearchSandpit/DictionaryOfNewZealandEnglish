Quote: <i>Pick-up boat </i>- The boat used for picking-up whales killed by whale-chasers. The pick-up boat would then tow the whales to the whaling station for processing. Sometimes, if the mother ship was not available for pick-up work, a spare chaser or the one with the least work on hand would take on the task of picking up.
