Quote: I have for many years cherished the heretical theory that the reason for the lack of any of the distinctive flavour in much of the food served in New Zealand can be traced to the national devotion to Pavlova Cake. This sugary confection has, for most adult palates, all the charm of heavily-scented shampoo folded into well-beaten shaving cream.

Quote: Pavlova cake has for so many years been a staple of any party ... [`Urumoa' writing from Oamaru searched old recipe books and found] 1. Meringue cake, copied from the Otago Daily Times of June 26, 1934. This is the same as the modern pavlova without the one teaspoon of cornflour. 2. `Cookery' by Miss I. Finlay [see preceding entry], published by the Dunedin City gas department, third edition, about 1933. ... recipe No. 452 for meringue sponge sandwich or pavlova cake, for which I was surprised to see she suggested sandwich tins or a special pavlova tin. When I bought one of the latter recently I thought they were something new! 3. Two privately-published but undated recipe books from Invercargill which must be pre-1933, as we left the city in that year. Both contain recipes for pavlova. [But do they specify the name `pavlova' ? HWO] It would be interesting ... to find out when the teaspoon of vinegar and teaspoon of cornflour were added to the recipe as they give pavlovas their marshmallow-type centre. The recipes I have mentioned list only egg whites, sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt. [Pavlova visited New Zealand in 1926: Auckland May 1926, Wanganui, Hastings, Napier, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Timaru, Dunedin: see Maurice Hurst <i>Music and the Stage in New Zealand.</i>Pavlova cake has for so many years been a staple of any party ...
