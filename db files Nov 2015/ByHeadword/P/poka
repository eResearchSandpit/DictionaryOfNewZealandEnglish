Quote: A tree, which I have not seen in this part of the country [Molyneux], is also sufficiently abundant there. Its leaf is like the rata, but its stem is clean and cylindrical, of a white colour, a good deal fissured. The native name of it is pokaka, and with the bark of it a black dye is made, which is equal to the dye of the hinau.
