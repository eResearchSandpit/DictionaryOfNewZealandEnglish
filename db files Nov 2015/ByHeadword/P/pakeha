Quote: I observed that the term `New Zealander' is already employed in this district; only, in lieu of `Noui-Tireni", as the natives of the Bay of Islands pronounce it, they say `Noui-Tirangui' [Nui Tirangi] [sic], which gives the word more of an indigenous sound. The word <i>pakeha</i> serves them to signify all whites, whom they also call `Iouropi' (Europeans). I did not observe that they had a special name for the English.

Quote: When my lot arrived they crowded the rail of the ship and cried, "What-ho, natives" (or, among the lower orders, like mine, "Wotcher, natives").  The people on the beach, somewhat nonplussed, I expect, needed a name to identify the new arrivals. They chose "pakeha".... These days it is used in government documents, even though there is confusion over just who is Pakeha: are Pacific Islanders Pakeha? Or Malaysian Chinese immigrants? Or Sudanese refugees?... I do not want to be identified as Pakeha, a colonial term that should have died out when the colonial century ended.

Quote: I am a Pakeha New Zealander, which I can explain and define with certainty. I was born and raised in New Zealand; my ancestors, going back at least five generations, were born and raised in New Zealand. My first ancestors, as far as I can tell, came from England. This is what it means to me to be a Pakeha.
