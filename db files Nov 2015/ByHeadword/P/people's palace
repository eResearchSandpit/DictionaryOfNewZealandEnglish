Quote: The People's Palace, as Trekkers was originally known, has been a stop-over for many thousands of New Zealanders over its 95-year history... The Salvation Army owned and operated The People's Palace, which was later called the Railton... The first section of The People's Palace, 203-205 Cuba St, had been opened as a home for "wayward" women in 1904... Many older New Zealanders have mentioned staying in The People's Palace during visits to Wellington, or as a staging point between the overnight train from Auckland and the Christchurch ferry.
