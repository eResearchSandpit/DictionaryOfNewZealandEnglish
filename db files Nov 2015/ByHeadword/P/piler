Quote: It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.
