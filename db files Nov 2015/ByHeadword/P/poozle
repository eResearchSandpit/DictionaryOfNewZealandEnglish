Quote: Finally, beware of the big purple poozle person (to poozle is to snaffle; to take).Things do go missing if left lying around - that includes tools, resources, equipment, materials and artwork. Put things away, be conscious of what you're using and where it comes from. If something disappears whilst you're using it, let the tutor know. And don't poozle other people's stuff without asking, or the original owner might forget to look after you and may break some furniture in their effort to get at you.

Quote: ...as usual, when the pressure went on, I couldn't find my start, of course - poozle a construction from the best first line in New Zealand literature - Ronald Hugh Morrieson, <i>The Scarecrow</i>, out of 1963. 'The same week our fowls were stolen, Daphne Moran had her throat cut.' Right.
