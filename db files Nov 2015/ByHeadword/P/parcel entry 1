Quote: The [wool buyer] takes into account the assessed `yield' which he can expect from each type. (Yield is the amount of wool fibre left after the wool has been washed, and the foreign matter, grease, `suint' (sweat), dust, and vegetable matter have been removed.) The yield is expressed as a percentage of the whole `parcel' of wool.
