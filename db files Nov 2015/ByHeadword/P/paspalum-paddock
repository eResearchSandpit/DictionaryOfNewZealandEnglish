Quote: For this reason special paspalum-paddocks should not be laid down with paspalum alone. In laying down a special paspalum-paddock it would be well to have a wide headland sown with an ordinary permanent-pasture mixture without paspalum .. In seasons when feed is superabundant and there is really no need for any special supplementary feed, the paspalum-paddock is likely to get away.
