Quote: From 1917, a newly formed Protestant Political Association canalised these discontents into a virulent anti-Catholic campaign, conducting a noisy agitation which provided a release for much pent-up tension. The PPA saw Irish events as part of a deep plot hatched in Rome against Protestant Britain and its Empire.
