Quote: Many people are becoming less materialistic... "Our standard of living has increased so much we can, more or less, take [our next meal] for granted, and for these people, their interest is becoming post-materialist." Dr Wilson thinks most at risk would be those yanked back to the farm after a spell at university "exposed to all those nasty post-materialist concerns".
