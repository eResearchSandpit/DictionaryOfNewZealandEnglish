Quote: This development [sc. the popularity of grapefruit] has a particular interest for New Zealand in that a type of grapefruit has been evolved from citrus introduced by Sir George grey and named by him the Poorman orange. New Zealand grapefuit as known to-day is a selected strain known generally as Morrison's Seedless, after the late Mr. H. Morrison, of Warkworth, who sought to improve the original Poorman orange, which was at one time considered suitable only for the manufacture of marmalade.
