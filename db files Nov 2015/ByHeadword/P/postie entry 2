Quote: Sir, - According to a recent report in `The Dominion' the Chief Postmaster at Wellington is reported to have used the term `posties' in referring to certain of his staff of postmen and postwomen. This is a slang term, derogatory and discourteous, like the term `cop' for police officer, `cockie' for farmer, and `rag' for newspapers. He should be asked to apologize to these diligent people who work on Saturdays when most other workers enjoy this day off duty, and when speaking about his staff should in future refer to them by thier correct and proper designation, postmen and postwomen. GEORGE H. DAVIS. New Plymouth.
