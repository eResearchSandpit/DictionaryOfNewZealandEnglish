Quote: Mention of the above term in 1890 reminds me of another side of Christchurch in those days - namely the gangs, or `pushes' as they were called - of larrikins. They wore bell-bottomed trousers, fancy shoes and well-oiled forelocks. These young ruffians frequently assaulted any lone pedestrian who happened to come their way.

Quote: <i>Push, n.</i>  gang. The word is of late, very common in Australia. It was once a prison term. Barrere and Leland quote from M. Davitt's `Leaves from a Prison Diary,' `the upper ten push.' In thieves' English it is (I) a crowd; (2) an association for a particular robbery. In Australia, its use began with the larrikins (q.v.), and spread, until now it often means clique, set, party, and even jocularly so far as `the Government House Push.' [1890]

Quote: There used to be much more of the push element around Christchurch than there is now, and it frequently occurred that pushes [ie youths belonging to these groups] like the `Tigers,' the `Diehards,' the `Scalpers,' and the `Skull-Draggers,' faced the music before the beak.
