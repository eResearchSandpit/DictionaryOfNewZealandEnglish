Quote: <i>Carpodetus serratus (The Serrate Carpodetus)</i>... The native name <i>Puta-puta-weta</i> signifies full of weta holes. In the North Island trees of this species are rarely cut down unperforated by longitudinal insect galleries. Another name by which it is known is <i>Puna-weta</i>. In the Urewera country it is called <i>Kai-weta</i> (i.e., weta food). [That ugly innocent the weta (<i>Deinacrida</i>) has thus been accused of perforating the tree; but as a matter of fact though often used as convenient residences [195] by the weta, the holes are made by the caterpillar of the large moth <i>Hepialus virescens</i>... ].

Quote: PUTAPUTAWTA or marble leaf (carpodetus serratus) is a handsome small tree with fabulous floiage and fragreant flowers. Much of it's beauty is in the mottled appearance of its leaves, the veins of which are a darker green than the leaf blade, hence the English common name of marble leaf.
