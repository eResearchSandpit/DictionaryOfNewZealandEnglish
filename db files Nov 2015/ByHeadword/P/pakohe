Quote: Starting with a brief account of the geology of this complex area and its significance as a source of pakohe (baked argillite) to Maori adze and tool makers Johnston goes on to give an account of the activities of various prospectors, promoters, business men, investors, and companies during the period that commenced with the discovery of copper in 1852 and ended with the auction of the Maoriland Copper Company's assets in October 1911.
