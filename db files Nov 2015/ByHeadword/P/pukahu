Quote: ... the floor of the kauri bush is covered with a thick coating of vegetable humus (<i>pukahu</i>), which is rendered highly inflammable by a mixture of dead leaves, particles of gum, and scales dropped from the resinous bark. <i>Ibid.</i> 493 Wherever the kauri-trees grow ... the ground is covered with a thick [493] layer of humus (<i>pukahau</i>),  composed of vegetable fibre intemingled with fallen leaves, particles of gum, and scales from the resinous bark, the latter helping to form a solid bank, sometimes several feet in height, round the base of the trees.

Quote: In early days the volume of the timber would not have warranted the time and expense involved clearing away the accumulated debris, known as pukahu (Maori: masses of rootlets), and usually referred to by the bushmen as `bookau'. <i>Ibid.</i> 208 The platform enabled a man to go from side to side, in order to pour <i>pukahu </i>down the face of the dam as a preventive of leaks in the planking. This pukahu (bookau to the bushman) was the matted, fibrous material which gathered at the foot of large Kauris.
