Notes: A term probably coined by Christchurch Stamp Dealer, Laurie Franks [19**-19**], to cover non-philatelic paper-based oddments in his regular auctions (see quot). Since used for collectable paper ephemera including pamphlets (but seldom books), indentures, wills, engraved invoices, even sometimes bus, tram and train tickets. Term possibly derived by analogy with Marginalia.
