Quote: <i>Pen</i>.- (1) A small yard; a division in the sheep-holding part of a woolshed. (2) Shearers catch out of a p., and when they apply for work they ask for a p. `Will you keep me a <i>p</i>. for next year, boss?' is often their farewell. Two shearers usually catch out of one pen and are called <i>p.-mates</i>.
