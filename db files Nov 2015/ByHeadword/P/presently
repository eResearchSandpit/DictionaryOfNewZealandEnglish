Definition:At directly this etym. comment: [OED2 6c dial and US 1851 `shortly' applies generally in NZ rather than 6 a. `immediately'. Compare the use ofpresently.] The following is moved from the DIRECTLY entry for check at PRESENTLY: presently. In NZ presently usually means `in a short while' (as OED 4), but I have heard it used occas. as immediately (OED 4). At <i>presently</i> 4, OED notes `In blunted sense (gradually weakened from 3): ... soon, shortly. (cf ANON 5, BY and BY 4, and colloq use of <i>directly, immediately,</i> and nearly all advbs of the same kind.) Now the ordinary use.'; W3]

Quote: This was in the days when "presently" meant "later" - not "as of now" as it seems to today.
