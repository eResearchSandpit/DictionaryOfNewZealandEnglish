Quote: The unofficial name by which [this reserve] is known to the citizens of Wellington is "Pigeon Park," and most fitting is this description, for over the years the pigeons have established forthemselves a veritable sanctuary in the heart of one of the city's busiest thoroughfares.

Quote: I remember Pigeon Park. A little oasis of grass and bird droppings in the middle of Wellington's central shopping precinct - the sort of place you could crash on a sunny afternoon, read a book, meet a street kid and laugh at the motorists who didn't know not to park under the tree where all the pigeons hung out.
