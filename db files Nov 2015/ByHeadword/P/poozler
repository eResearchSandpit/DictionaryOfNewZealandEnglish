Quote: My old friend Kae Miller used to drive a gaily decorated van with "A Pride of Poozlers" inscribed on the side. My son Jonathan, who has driven that van, believes it was around in the early 1770. I am sure it was some time in the 70s. I have the impression, perhaps wrongly, that Kae invented the words poozle, poozling and poozler. Jonathan has the same belief but neither of us is sure if it is correct. She certainly used these words. Kae (single name Katrine Hursthouse), was a dedicated environmentalist,long before it was fashionable. Poozling was a part of her environmentalism. She poozled (I think she would have resisted the word "scavenge") diligently in the old Wilton tip and claimed to have rescued valuable antiques.
