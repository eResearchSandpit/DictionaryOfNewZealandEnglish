Quote: Has anybody heard of `Pommy-ism' and, if so, what is it. Says `The Soldier' (Sydney) ... The name `Pommy' is strongly resented by immigrants after they have been resident in Australia a few weeks, yet they are entirely to blame if the name sticks. Some of the newcomers will not drop their `pommy-ism' and they assume a silly air of `superiority', even going to the extent of trying to keep ex-Imperial sevice men in a sort of private organisaion. ... What is written of Australia might well apply with R.S.A. substituted for R.S.S.I.L.
