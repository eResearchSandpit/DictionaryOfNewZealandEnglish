The little restless piwakawaka [a2,a4-acute], a kind of thrush, who is incessantly hopping from twig to twig, put forth its single note. <i>Ibid.</i> 1/298 The <i>Piwaka-waka</i> [a2's-acute] is the Musicapa flabellifera, or fan-tailed fly-catcher.

Quote: <i>pi[i]wakawaka</i>, a bird (Rhipidura flabellifera), pied fantail: the so-called black fantail, which is chocolate-colour (R. fuliginosa) is ti[i]wakawaka. The former is common throughout Newzealand; the latter is common in the South Island but rather rare in the North and is thought to be a mutant of the former. Both names were applied to both birds by the Maori, but for distinction pi[i]wakawaka for the pied and ti[i]wakawaka for the black have been adopted by the Pakeha. The bird is noted for the disaster it caused to Maui in his struggle with the mother of night, Hine-nui-te-po, Death personified.

Quote: In the lower regions the forest was much enlivened by birds. I shot some parrots [fn Nestor meridionalis. Kaka of the natives.], pigeons [fn Columba spadicea, Lath. Kukupa.], and wattle-birds [fn Glaucopis cinerea, Gmel. Kokako.]. Among the branches of the trees hopped the neat fantail flycatcher [fn Muscicapa flabellifera, Gml. Piwakawaka.], and a social bird of a yellow colour, which has been depicted by Forster [fn Orthornyx heteroclytus, Lef.   Popokatea.], and which had much the habits of the finch.
