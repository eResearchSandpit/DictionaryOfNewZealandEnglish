Quote: The <i>tawheras</i> that had been missed had dried and shrivelled, and the white of the <i>tiore</i> had decayed, but the fingers of the `gentlemen' had swollen considerably and now provided us with New Zealand `pineapples.' The really good ones were eight inches long and two-and-a-half inches in diameter. They were wrenched out in the same way as giggies. These `pineapples' were never very much sought after by the general public. They needed what might be called an acquired taste. They were tricky eating too. You bit off all the outside hard, nobbly but not prickly covering, and then gnawed the soft, sweet flesh to the bone.
