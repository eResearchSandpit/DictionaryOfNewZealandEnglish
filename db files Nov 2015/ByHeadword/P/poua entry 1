Quote: In this paper I will endeavour to prove that the large, mythological, and extinct bird the poua, traditionally spoken of by the remaining surrvivors of the Moriori people who inhabit the Chatham Islands, was not allied to the moa ... but was a species of swan, and belonged to the family <i>Anatidae</i>.

Quote: Post-European re-working of different legends about big birds.. seems even more evident in the names poua and pouaki. These were alleged by Tare te Maiharoa an influential South Island chief about the turn of the 20th century to be the true, ancient names for moas.

Quote: It appears that the Morioris have traditions about a great bird, called by them Puoa... The Morioris have a song about it, and repeat the first syllable as a chorus, Pu, pu - Pu, pu - Pu, o-a, in a manner which recalls the hollow drumming noise made by the emu. The word is probably a contraction for Pu-pu-moa.
