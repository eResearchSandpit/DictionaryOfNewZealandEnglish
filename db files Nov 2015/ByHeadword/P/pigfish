Quote: Congiopodus leucopoecilus, [sic] <i>Richardson. </i> The fish is popularly known as `pig-fish', on account of the grunting noise it makes when taken out of the water and has to gasp for air. It is sometimes called `leather-jacket', a name which, however, is more correctly applied to [<i>Navodon] scaber</i>, another very common fish in Otago Harbour.

Quote: The Soldier-fish (<i>Scorpaena cruenta</i>) and the variegated horror with the droll name of Hapuka's Grandfather (<i>Helicolenus percoides</i>) are members of the same order, as also are the Pig-fish (<i>Congiopodus leucopaecilus</i> ) and the Toad-fish (<i>Neophrynichthys latus</i>) whose names appropriately suggest something out of the run of ordinary fish shapes.

Quote: PIGFISH (PURAMORUA) <i>Congiopodus leucopaecilus</i> (Richardson) ...This fish is sometimes called Leather-jacket by many fishermen, probably on account of its leathery skin, but this name is misleading as the proper and popular Leather Jacket is a smaller fish with a tough rough and leathery skin and with one single spine on its back. Many years ago these fish were sold to the public in large numbers but only for a short period when others were exceptionally scarce. scarce. The fish were skinned so that they looked quite different from the fish in its natural state. They were then railed to a country town and sold readily under the name of Snap Jacks or Skip Jacks.
