Quote: <i>piupiu</i>, a garment consisting of a heavy fringe, about nine inches wide or more, made of flax and craped at intervals and dyed black. The flax when drying curling up into pipes. This fringe hung down the bare thighs, and as the wearer moved the gentle click-click of the hard tubes made a sound that was liked as to the frou-frou of a silk dress.
