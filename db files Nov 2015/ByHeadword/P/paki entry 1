Quote: Pakihi has in the South Island been borrowed from the Maori for a patch of country naturally clear of bush and is applied particularly to the poor wet land, unsuitable for development, on the West Coast. Haast wrote of 'pakis or open tracts of land.' in Nelson. As pakihis are frequently surrounded by bush, a bald spot on one's head may be called a pakihi, but that is slang.
