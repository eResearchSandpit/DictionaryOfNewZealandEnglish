Quote: On the division of New Zealand into provinces. 1. For the present, and until further order be made in that behalf, the islands of New Zealand shall be divided into two provinces, to be known respectively by the designations of the "Province of New Ulster", and the "Province of New Munster". 2. The Province of New Ulster shall comprise the whole of the island hitherto called the Island of New Ulster, with the exception of those parts of the said island adjacent to Cook's Straits, which the Governor-in-Chief of New Zealand may, by any such proclamation as aforesaid, except and exclude from the province of New Ulster.

Quote:  ... Earl Grey decided in mid-1846 to confer on the colony a most complex constitution which, inter alia, provided for the creation of two provinces, New Ulster and New Munster, whose boundary line was to run due east across the North Island from the mouth of the Patea River'. [Then you'll have the later constitution, the abolition of the provinces and its extension in meaning today in sporting circles to include Bush, Waikato, King Country etc. which were never provinces. J. Winchester 1963]
