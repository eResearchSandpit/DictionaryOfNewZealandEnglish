Quote: Poroporo is a common, leafy soft-wooded shrub that grows throughout New Zealand.  It is quickly growing colonising plant, reaching a height of three metres (ideal for native bush revegetation sites) and grows on the edge of coastal and lowland forests and along road edges and clearings.  ... Reputedly having a mild acidic taste similar to the cape gooseberry, poroporo was cultivated and eaten by Maori and early European colonists who made jam from it.

Two Latin names, <i>S. laciniatum</i> and <i>S. aviculare</i>, are both more than a hundred years old but it was only in 1954 that Baylis defined clearly the difference between the two species and then the two names came into general use.
