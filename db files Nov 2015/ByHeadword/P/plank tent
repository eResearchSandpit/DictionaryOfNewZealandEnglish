Quote: You would laugh if you saw the place from which I am writing. It is a little `plank tent' or `V. hut', as a thing made of long boards leaning against each other is indiscriminately called; its locality is the side of a small wood, by which runs a clear stream, on the plain, about ten miles from Lyttelton.
