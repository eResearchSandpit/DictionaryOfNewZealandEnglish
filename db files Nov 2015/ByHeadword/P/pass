Quote: As the mine workings reached greater depths the ground generally became more solid and stable and more and more shrinkage stopes were worked, until this method became the principal one in use for stopes up to about forty feet in width. The method consisted of putting in the level timbers in the usual way, with short chutes or `passes' installed every other set to allow all the ore in the stope to be lowered evenly as it was worked. <i>Ibid.</i> 209 ... including ... chutes for ore-handling, or `passes' as they were generally known. <i>Ibid.</i> 315 <i>Chutes or passes</i>: Chutes for running the broken ore out of the stopes into the hand-trucks were, for shrinkage stopes, placed between alternate sets (about 10 ft centres). They were about three feet wide, mounted three inches above the truck, and fitted with top and bottom doors. The bottom door was removed and the flow of ore into the truck controlled by jambing a pass-bar across the chute. (This was a short bar about three feet long with a D-shaped handle). The bottom of the chute was inclined at about 50 degrees from horizontal. For filled stopes, the chute was installed at the bottoms of the cribbed ore passes, leading up through the filling to the face of the stope; the ore passes were usually spaced from 18 to 25 ft apart along the stope, this being a convenient distance for men to shovel the ore. <i>Ibid.</i> 329 <i>Passes:</i> See chutes.
