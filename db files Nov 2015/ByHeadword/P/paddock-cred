Quote: These poems are at their weakest when they are either self-consciously striving to establish Turner's black singlet paddock-cred ("cobbers" talk about the "footie" and revile the smooth talkers from "the Big Smoke", etc), or openly lament the metrosexualisation of the New Zealand bloke: "but oh, real Kiwi jokers, Whaddarya / even Valentine's Day has caught on like the pox".
