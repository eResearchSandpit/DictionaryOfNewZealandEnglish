Quote: Andrew Cuningham.. wonders about "the end of the penny section". This literally means the far reaches of the main urban transport route through a city or town which used to cost one penny in the gold [sic] old days. Once you've reached the end of the penny section, you are heading for the suburbs. However, the expression is also used colloquially to mean the end of the easy stuff or the end of the golden weather. Once you're out of th penny section, you have to pay more, or, in this sense, work a bit harder.

Quote: I have ridden in their 'busses [sic] on several occasions and have each time noticed the dissatisfaction expressed to the guard by the patrons of their line at the charge of 3d demanded from passengers getting in at any part of Molesworth-street, quite irrespective of the distance they may wish to go, even though that distance may only be to the Government Buildings, and this in contradiction to their announcement of the 16th instant, stating that on and after the 17th instant 'busses would run "penny sections, the same as Tram Company."
