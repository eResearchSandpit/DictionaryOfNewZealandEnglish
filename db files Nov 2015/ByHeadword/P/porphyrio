Quote: Mr. Gould infers that [the Notornis] affects low and humid situations, marshes, the banks of rivers, and the coverts of dripping ferns, and, like the Porphyrio, doubtless enjoys the power of swimming but would seem, from the structure of its legs, to be more terrestrial in its habits than the members of that genus.
