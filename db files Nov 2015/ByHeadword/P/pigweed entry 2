Quote:  WIREWEED (<i>Polygonum aviculare</i>), also called road weed, mat weed, knot grass, `pig weed,' and hog weed, is common in cultivated land all over the country. It is an annual, with stems up to 2ft. in length trailing over the ground. The stems have swollen nodes (`knot grass') and are very tough (`wireweed').
