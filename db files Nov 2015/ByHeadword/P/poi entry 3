Quote: <i> poi</i>, a light ball made from raupo blades, with a short string attached to it which is swung and twisted rhythmically, in the manner of Indian clubs, to the accompaniment of a song; the so-called poi-dance, which is less a dance than a whirling of the balls and a swaying of the body in time with the song. There is a long-poi, in which the string is perhaps a yard long.
