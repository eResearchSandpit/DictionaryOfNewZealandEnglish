Quote: ... if he resigns his seat a rank Provincialist will get in for New Plymouth. <i>Ibid.</i>  2/413 Of course, that the abolition of the provinces is a <i>fait accompli</i> is hardly denied now by even the hottest Provincialist, but how can Auckland and Otago work together harmoniously now the provincialist war cry cannot be used to rally them?

Quote: After all, the names `Centralist' and `Provincialist' do not in most cases give a truer impression than party nick-names generally convey. `Centralism', properly so called, is repugnant to all the political instincts of Englishmen. `Provincialism' is as repugnant their educated sympathisers who are called or erroneously call themselves Centralists are truer friends of local self-government than many of the defenders of `Provincialism', while some who find themselves classed under the name of Provincialists have the most profound contempt for the assumption and local tyranny that have distinguished one or two of our little centralisms.

Quote:  Two parties were now [mid 1850s] developed in the colony; one was called Centralists, the other Provincialists. The former aimed at the incorporation of the provincial governments, with a view to their ultimate absorption, and maintained the right of the General Assembly to intermeddle in all provincial affairs. The latter, on the other hand, insisted that the Imperial Parliament had established two independent governments in New Zealand, each for its own sphere, the provinces having exclusive jurisdiction in all provincial matters, and only under the control of the General Assembly on matters of general concern.

Quote: There were in the House of Representatives in the fifties, less clearly thereafter, two loose groups which were called the `Centralist' and the `Provincialist' parties. No one has succeeded in giving a convincing explanation of the nature of this division, nor made clear to what extent these labels were meaningful.
