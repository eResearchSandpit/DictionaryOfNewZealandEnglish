Quote: One of these [curious plants of Stewart Island] is the <i>puharitaiko</i> (senecio rotundifolius) with large glossy-green leathery leaves, on which messages can be written in ink. These leaves could be stamped and sent through the post-office a few years ago, but the practice is now interdicted.
