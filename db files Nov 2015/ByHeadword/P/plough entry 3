Quote: When the first settlers came to New Zealand, they didn't bring many ploughs with them from their home countries. ... [Blacksmiths] set up their smithies and began making implements more suitable for the terrain. One of the first of [the New Zealand made ploughs] was a long sleek job known as a swing plough. Just why is hard to say ... The furrows were the result of the accuracy of the ploughman's eye, as it had no wheels whatever. The depth was graduated by the bridle adjustment but was corrected in uneven ground by leverage from the long handles, or stilts as they were called. If the the share struck anything these [swing ploughs] had a kick like a run cow. It is said that a good man could land on his feet six yards in front of the horses ... The next development was the lever plough which ran on three wheels and had no handles except a stubby one at the back.
