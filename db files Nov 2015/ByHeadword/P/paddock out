Quote: But as this fine gum became scarcer, and the article had to be searched for at a greater depth the long spears of later times came into use, and now the scarcity of the gum has become such that, except in swampy ground, the use of the spear seems to be almost abandoned, and the diggers are beginning to find it necessary to dig in a more systematic manner, paddocking out the ground as they go, so as once and for all to exhaust its contents.
