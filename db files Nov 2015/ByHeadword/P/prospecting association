Quote: Yesterday afternoon a number of Te Aroha residents .. proceeded to Waitoa in order to judge whether there had been any tampering with the stuff at the shafts, Mr. Pond in his report to the Waitoa Prospecting Association having stated that the unnatural gold found by him came from heaps of stuff at the mouth of the shaft numbered 12.
