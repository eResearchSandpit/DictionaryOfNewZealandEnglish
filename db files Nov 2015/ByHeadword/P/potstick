Quote: <i>Potstick</i> wooden pole 6 feet long and 2 inches thick, used to stir and lift wool during the wash. <i>Ibid.</i> 17 The potstick woolwashers were the industry's founders. <i>Ibid.</i> A hot soak preceded the cold-water wash, and in the Medieval manner a strong arm wielded the six-foot potstick or the sluice fork stirring and lifting sodden wool. Scouring machines were a remote dream. <i>Ibid.</i> 34 Even in the mid-1960s, recalls Brian Redding, the present owner , `they were potsticking slipe wool from the fellmongery; via a wooden chute, water went into a box with a mesh base and a fellow stirred [35] the wool with a stick!'
