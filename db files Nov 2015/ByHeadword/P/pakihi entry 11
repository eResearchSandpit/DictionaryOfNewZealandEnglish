Quote: We now advanced along the plain [towards Moeraki], which was covered with `patiti' and ... stunted fern and `tutu'. These plains are called `pakihi,' a word used in the North Island to signify dried up. So that `tupakihi,' the name by which the `tutu' is there known, appears to be a contraction of `tutupakihi,' or `tutu' of the [196] plains, which are well called `pakihi,' being for the most part arid. <i>Ibid.</i> 311 PAKIHI, open country, bare of trees, covered with coarse wiry grass, stunted fern, and low shrubs. It does not necessarily signify `a plain'. The `a' is sounded long and broad in this word, by which it is distinguished from `pakihi,' to be low water, or to drain off as a river after a flood, in which the `a' has a sound both short and soft. `Kua pakihi te wai o Waitaki,' the water of Waitahi has become low.

Quote: Then there are two well-known and often disputed words, Parkee and Wareleggo. Parkee is very expressive. It is used of an open space partly surrounded by the dark green birch bush whose compact and shapely foliage suggested to the early settlers the ordered parklands to which they were accustomed. A clearing completely surrounded by bush will be called a `blind Parkee'.
