Quote: To get the coal out, you divvied the seam up into 'pillars' a square chain wide. Then you drove alleyways called 'bords' to the very back of the pillar and you worked back towards the main shaft, taking 'lifts' off the pillars as you went... As you worked at the pillar - picking, shotfiring, shovelling an' that - it got thinner an' thinner until in the end it looked like a big black tornado, or a tree holding up the sky. That's why the last strand of the pillar is called a 'mahuta'.

These drives were called main levels. The bords were driven about two chains off the dip, and the `stenton' would be driven from the lower level to the one above.
