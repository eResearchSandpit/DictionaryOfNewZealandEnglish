Quote: When the rivers are at all high the `pilot' horse is indispensable - a clever, steady animal who spends his live in crossing and recrossing the river. It is interesting to watch the `fordman' trying for a possible crossing on his horse .... and the horse's readiness to `turn' a boulder too big to step over.
