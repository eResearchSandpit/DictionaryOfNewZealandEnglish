Quote: Edward Thompson writes: `Quite a lot of squared timber was taken out of Hokianga and Whangape in the fifties & sixties ... About 1906 I became acquainted with Captain Keane. ... I remember him telling me how they got the squared spars out of the bush before jacks & bullocks were thought of ...' ...
