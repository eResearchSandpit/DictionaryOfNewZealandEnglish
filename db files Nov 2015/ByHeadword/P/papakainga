Quote: Papakainga - `homeground' does not reveal the spiritual and emotional connotations this word implies. Papakainga is that area where one's original kinship group came from and lived. Whether or not the area has buildings on it, it has strong emotional overtones for any Maori. In this age of the urban Maori, the ability to refer to ancestral areas - the place where one's own history was made - is a matter of deep pride. Once known, one can never leave it - though one may be physically absent all one's life.

The rest, after the papakainga lands have been clearly defined, may be leased, and in certain cases sold.
