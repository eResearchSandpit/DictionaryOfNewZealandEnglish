Notes: Joh saw one of these for sale in Taupo "The man behind the counter said it was an English term; bsasically it was a broomstick with a hollow copper head, like a plunger in shape. The man said sometimes the copper head contained marbles so that madam could hear that the maid was indeed working. Ian Douglas (51 Liverpool St, Wanganui; dougie@xtra.co.nz) says the term used in England 60 years ago was "poss stick" a long wooden stick.  "There was also a 'posser'which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt."
