Quote: I left this honest employ to go to Adelaide with a young man who was a very clever pensman [forger]. We were disappointed when we got there as we had been informed it was a more flourishing place than Melbourne. While here we effected several minor forgeries, but in my absence he tendered a fake cheque and got detected.
