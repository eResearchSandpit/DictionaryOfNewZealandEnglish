Quote: Another of New Zealand's contributions to library science, the <i>rental collection</i> or <i>pay collection</i>, reflects the other side of the New Zealand character. Rental collections in free Public Libraries provide `popular' books not justifiably bought with public money, and sometimes also duplicate books in heavy demand.
