Quote: Two women, a cook and a nurse, were gaoled for three months in Wallasey, England, recently for "communicating" with German prisoners. The two "tarts" used to sneak out and "communicate" with the 'orrid 'Uns under cover of darkness. Food is certainly not the only shortage in Pommie-land nowadays, as far as the womenfolk are concerned, at any rate. Nor, it is fairly evident, are all the ministering angels as noble-hearted as was Nurse Cavell.
