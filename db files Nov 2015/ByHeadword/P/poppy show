Quote: When I was a child, a well-used term for any female accidentally showing too much underwear was "poppy show" - just saying the two words ensured a rapid hitching of petticoat or smoothing of rumpled skirts.

Quote: Pin dips were also another popular amusement. `A pin or a bull or a button, To see a rary rary show show show!' (1875; Tahataki). A piece of glass backed by cardboard was covered with a piece of paper that could be flicked up to show the `rary rary show' or had a slit in it through which one could peep. One saw through the glass a variety of colors, pieces of colored paper, flower petals, pictures, and later pieces off cigarette boxes. Sometimes these had been arranged in some pattern, at other times they were kaleidoscopic only, and the perceiver had himself to add the configurations of intelligibility. The price for the view was always a pin `which we did not want anyhow but always accepted,' a relic from an age when such things were rare. Pin dips were known also as `poppy shows' (perhaps it was the similar flash of color that gave the same name - `the poppy show' - to the exciting experience of seeing a girl's dress blown upward by the wind; pins were not charged for flowers of this sort). In fact, the pin dip or the prick book may have developed from the poppy show. The poppy show was common before 1900 and the prick book after that date, a fact connected with the ever-increasing stock of picture cards and magazine pictures available to children.
