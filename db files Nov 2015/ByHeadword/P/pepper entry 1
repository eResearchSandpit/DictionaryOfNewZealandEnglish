Quote:  Even the semi-tropical true pepper [fn <i>Piper excelsum</i>.] disputes with the false native pepper [fn <i>Drimys colorata.</i>] the right to its name, and yet another semi-tropical plant, the nikau [fn <i>Areca sapida</i>.] - New Zealand's only palm - extends as far south as Banks Peninsula, though not found on the Port Hills.
