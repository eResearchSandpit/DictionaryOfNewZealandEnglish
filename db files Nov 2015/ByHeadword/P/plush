Quote: Cheyne then got a board and one of the plushes from the manager's office, laid the plush on the board, and fixed the board from the gold box to the streaming down pipe. Cheyne then took a quantity of sand out of the box, put it on the board, and turned the water on, and washed the sand back into the gold box. The gold remained on the plush.

Quote: But my plan would be to put a wide sluice-box in the tail end of the ground-sluice, line it well with plush or green baize or a blanket, and place a man with a fork a few yards in front of the box to throw out all the stones he could. By doing this you would find out whether you were losing gold or not.
