Quote: `... this has spoilt a good day. I have been raging all day. I punched him over because he tried to punch me over, and put me in my place. He reckoned he was a Liverpudlian seaman who had been here for 20 years, a big toughie,' Gilbert had told him... Detective Rex Barnett said that Gilbert admitted that he had `punched over' a man in the toilets `because he was trying to buy something I do not like.'
