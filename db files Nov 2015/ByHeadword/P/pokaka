Quote: Amongst smaller trees and shrubs the most prominent are the horoeka(<i>Panax crassifolia</i>), and its congeners <i> Panax simplex</i> and <i> P. edgerleyi,</i> both exhibiting such excessive luxuriance as frequently to require an examination of the fruit before their identification can be determined; the rautawhiri (<i> Pittosporum tenuifolium,</i> var. <i> colensoi</i>), the kotukutuku (<i> Fuchsia excorticata</i>), the mako (<i> Aristotelia racemosa</i>), the mapau (<i> Myrsine australis</i>), the pokako[sic] (<i> Eloeocarpus hookerianus</i>), also <i> Carpodetus serratus, Myrsine divaricata</i>, both of which are abundant. The remarkable `weeping tree', <i> Myrsine montana</i>, with its crowded recurved branches and small foliage, affords a picturesque effect
