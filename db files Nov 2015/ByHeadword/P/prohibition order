Quote:  `What the hell nonsense is this? Why not?' I felt myself blustering, in front of the friends for whom I'd just ordered the first round. `Sorry, I'm not allowed to serve you.' `Why not, I say?' `Well,' he looked at my friends and tried to say it quietly but they heard all right, `your wife's had you pro'd.' [199] Imagine it, a prohibition order taken out against me. And they say it's a man's world, when a woman can stop her husband buying a drink. Not just buying one either, she can even stop him from getting his friends to buy him one.
