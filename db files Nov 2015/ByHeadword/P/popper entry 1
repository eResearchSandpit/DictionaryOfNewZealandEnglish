Quote: The air beat and shimmered with sound . . . [sic] the poppers, eating with their thin blue tongues into rock ... <i>Ibid.</i> 186 The air [in the hydro tunnel] was filled with a ceaseless roar of air-compressors, poppers, and the biggest air-picks they had ever seen, all new machinery ... As the men's hands steadied the poppers (the tongues of flame eating into rotten sandstone ...), you could watch their taut arms vibrate, their bodies tremble.

Quote: It was not until considerably later that the `swing type' stoper with its pneumatic-feed-leg for drilling uppers, and known as the `popper', came into use. In it the drill was rotated in the hole by swinging the machine handle backwards and forwards. At first the miners did not like it, as they considered it `shook up' the roof too much, causing falls of ground, but it was light and easily transportable and was fast in good ground. It remained in use in the stopes for many years, until the much later introduction of the rotary stoper. At one stage the popper was given the rather undeserved name of the `widow-maker'.

Quote: In theory the rock drill which figures so prominently in the dispute at Reefton is a Waugh, but in practice it is a "popper." It is worked by compressed air, and a hammer, stirking 500 blows a minute, pops like a Maxim gun on the quartz overhead. Hence the name "popper."

Quote: Sir Arthur Guinness interviewed the Prime Minister this morning, and urged him to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire and report whether the "popper" drill could with safety, and especially in regard to the health of the miners, be worked by one man.
