Quote: One day [the colonial barmaid] is calling out "Beef-steak pudding, two!" in the grubby dining-room of a pubbery, the next she coruscates before rows of shining bottles, asking "What's yours?" with more or less alluring sweetness, and the morrow may see her on the visiting list at Government House by the quick evolution of a matrimonial coup with some guilded Johnny.

Quote: Another memory that lingered on the trip, was that from Napier to Gisborne, to inspect a property known as `Te Rapa' and nearby was a `pubbery' (certainly not a hotel, for anybody would wonder why the Licensed Victuallers Association ever granted a licence for meals or liquor to be dispensed), and was typically designated `The Trap'. Truly, this pubbery was just short of shanty, typical of the `Outer Barcoo', but where Maories, their Wahines, or broken down `Remittancers' could drown their sorrows, wander into the `arms of Bacchus' or chase pink elephants.

Quote: Much large dampness during the week put Dunedin's wickets out of action, so to speak, and players and public last Saturday afternoon spent their time in their favorite pubbery, or the Y.M.C.A., or meditating over the elections.
