Quote: BAITFISH, RED <i>Emmelichthys nitidus:</i> A less common species in New Zealand waters this fish turns up unpredictably in vast schools that give the water a red appearance - and the fish its name. Grow up to about 16 inches and known also as picarel, pearl fish and red herring. Colours light pink to dark red.
