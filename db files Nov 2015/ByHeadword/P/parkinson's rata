Quote: Another excitement is the flowering of the shrubby rata, Metrosideros parkinsonii, which has springtime, vermilion red bottle-brush flowers from September to November. This rare tree produces its flowers on its old bare stalks, something no other rata or pohutukawa does... In nature, this shrubby rata is found only in Great Barrier Island and in northwest Nelson.

Quote: There are ten native species of rata in New Zealand all in the genus Metrosideros. Four of these form trees (northern rata, southern rata, Bartlett's rata and Parkinson's rata) and the remaining six species are all lianes.
