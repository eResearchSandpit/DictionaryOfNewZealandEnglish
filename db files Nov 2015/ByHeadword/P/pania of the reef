Quote: On June 9, 1954, the prime minister, Sid Holland, unveiled a bronze statue of Pania of the Reef in Napier... Whatairi was one of 120 girls from the area on the "short-list" as the model for Pania, then it was whittled down to four... "Pania will be there long after I have gone, but my mokopuna will see it and say 'there's granny'."
