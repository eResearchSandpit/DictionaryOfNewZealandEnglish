Notes: I think pool housing probably arose from the committee mentioned in the Jan. 1947 cit; however, the only use of the term "pool" I found in 1947 and 1949 PSJs was the second which could be the first printed surfacing of an underground term.  The December 1946 issue has numerous "wanted to swap state house" advertisements indicating the need existed.
