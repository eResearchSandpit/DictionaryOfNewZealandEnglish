Quote: The term is of Australian origin, of a period long ago when the military and other authorities of the time called the men of the penal settlement, "Prisoners of Mother England," which was shortenedto P.O.M.E. and later made "Pommie". The New Zealand term was "Homie" until superseded by the Australian adjective. And even now "Pommie" is being superseded by the term "Pongo".

Quote: (Corresp. col) Sir, - Your correspondents are incorrect regarding the origin of the term `Pommie', meaning English immigrant. The term is of Australian origin, of a period long ago when the military and other authorities of the time called the men of the penal settlements, `Prisoners of Mother England', which was shortened to P.O.M.E. and later made `Pommie'. The New Zealand term was `Homie' until superseded by the Australian adjective. And even now Pommie is being superseded by the term `Pongo'. The term certainly was derisive in origin, and as to whether it is still derisive depends entirely upon the individual addressed as such. The writer is of the fourth generation (N.Z. with Austr. connections). Winther Pedersen.

Quote: A Tasmanian gave the origin definitely as being `pomegranate', the colour of that fruit being similar to the high colour of the complexions of the English, and very noticeable against the sun-dried appearance of the Aussie complexion. This has been acceptable to many knowing the Aussies' susceptibility to using phrases such as `plates of meat' for feet and `trouble for strife' for wife. Pommy to many has become a most objectionable word owing to the way it has been used with other words. Only the most ignorant use of such terms, not thinking that their forefathers came from that same brave country. If my comrades of the Homeland, newly arrived, who use the nom-de-plume, or refer to themselves as `Pommies', read this they will now understand why it is objectionable even when used in a friendly manner. British and Proud of it.

Quote: Sir, - Fifty years ago a shipload of passengers arrived in Australia. Coming through the tropics, they got badly burned and their faces were scarlet. The word `Pommie' was derived from a well-known Australian fruit at the time, the scarlet pomegranate. So the Australians named the new arrivals `Pommies' (just fun), and `Pommie' is still used occasionally. -E.M.W.

Quote:  Sir, -A correspondent wishes to know the origin of the word `Pommie.' The famous war correspondent, the late Ashmad Barlett, in his book, `Despatches from the Dardanelles,' written at the time of the campaign, says that the term `Pommie' was applied by veteran troops of the campaign to newly arrived troops from Britain. Their fresh pink complexions were likened to the fruit pomegranate, in contrast to the bronzed features of the veteran troops. They were referred to as `Pommies.' The term, therefore, was not applied by Dominion troops in particular to those from Britain, but by veteran troops, both British and Dominion, to new arrivals. -KIWI.

Quote: Sir, - In reply to O.J. Davis and `Very Interested' relating to the origin of the word `Pommie.' The word apparently came into being during the 1914-18 War and is derived from the French word pommes, meaning, I believe, potatoes. During the war the front line troops of the British Army were very seriously short of food, except for potatoes, on which they subsisted for many weeks. Hence on the fields at Flanders this peculiar and, I might say, very controversial word came into being. I am sure that any British World War I veteran could affirm this explanation.-W.J.BRACKS.

Quote:  Sir, - It is `POM-E,' not `Pommie.' These four letters originated in the old sailing ship days. Migrants leaving the British Isles were issued with a permit of migration certificate which was headed, `Permit of migration-Ireland,' `Permit of migration-England,' depending on the part of the British Isles one was from. The first letters in these four words `Permit of migration-England' are `POM-E,' spelt now, as pronounced then, `Pommie.' -SAILS.

Quote: Sir, - The red coat of the soldier gave rise to the sailors' nickname for him of `Pommy,' a corruption of the French `pomme.' This derivation is far more likely than `Prisoner of Mother England.' The derogatory nickname would be more likely to stick to the guards than to the convicts. If my explanation is incorrect am I entitled to call our trans-Tasman cousins (and others) `Pommies?' - I am, etc., A PENSIONER OF MOTHER ENGLAND.

Quote: Sir, - Unfortunately previous correspondents have been confused by the spelling of `Pommy.' I understand the correct spelling to be P.O.M.M.I.E., this being derived from the initial letters of the phrase, `People of Many Magnificient Immortal Epics.' This derivation was given in the Australian R.S.L. magazine several years ago. - I am, etc, DRONGATUS PONGORUM.

Quote: EVERY now and then some one puts forward a new theory on why Englishmen are occasionally referred to in these southern latitudes as `Pommies'. The following note from Mr. G.T.M., of the coastal motor vessel Squall, at Wellington, may clear things up: `I first visited Aussie in 1911-Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Immigrants were variously termed-Immygrant', `Jimmy grants', and up among the bananalanders, quite often `Pommy grants' (pomegranates). Very soon this became `Pommy'; and this, I think, would be the true derivation.'

Quote: Has anybody heard of `Pommy-ism' and, if so, what is it. Says `The Soldier' (Sydney) ... The name `Pommy' is strongly resented by immigrants after they have been resident in Australia a few weeks, yet they are entirely to blame if the name sticks. Some of the newcomers will not drop their `pommy-ism' and they assume a silly air of `superiority', even going to the extent of trying to keep ex-Imperial sevice men in a sort of private organisaion. ... What is written of Australia might well apply with R.S.A. substituted for R.S.S.I.L.

Quote: `[New Zealanders] like the English, provided they are the right type; the educated young man gets on well. They don't like the `Pommie' as they call him, God knows why, and no one can tell you where the name came from, but its more common in Australia than in New Zealand'. `What is a Pommie?' `Blest if I know; it's hard to define, but usually the short, shrunken industrial worker, the man with the broad accent, from Yorkshire or Lancashire. The stunted product of sweated labour, from mills factories and mines. I've heard him referred to as a Pommie, but never the upstanding educated young fellow. They seem to welcome him; he is like themselves'.
