Quote: `A real Pommie eh? Imagine that.' `Yes, we're all Pommies here.' `A real bloody Pongo.' `This Pongo business annoys me. You haven't even got it right. Pongo's the naval word for soldiers or marines. Out here they use it as just another form of Pommie.' `Oh well, it's all the same to me.' ... `They're all right really. The Pommies, I mean. The Homeys, the Chooms, the Pongos.'

Quote: <i>pongo</i> British person; originally used by British sailors to describe marine or soldier they were required to join forces with in WWI, probably not unaware that the word meant `monkey', though derivation credited to forage cap resembling that worn by the dog Pongo in a Punch and Judy show; brought back by Anzacs as name for their British counterpart.
