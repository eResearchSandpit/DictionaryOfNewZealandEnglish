Quote: HARESFOOT TREFOIL (<i>Trifolium arvense</i>), also occasionally called stone clover and pussy tail, is a weed of light dry gravelly soils and roadsides over both islands. It is an annual with greyish, downy, very inconspicuous leaves, ... and the hairy flower heads, feeling something like a hare's foot, are very characteristic.
