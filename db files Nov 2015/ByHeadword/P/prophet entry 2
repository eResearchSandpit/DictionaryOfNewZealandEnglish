Quote: Gaily the pilgrim harnessed his plough, / When he had built up a roof o'er his head; / Singing, `From Albion hither I come;' / `Land of mine! land of mine! grow me some bread.' Proudly the prophet flourished his crook, / When he had landed his sheep from the west; / Singing, `From Philipland hither I come;' / `Silly men! silly men! wool pays the best.'

Quote: ...An old Australian squatter, who visited the Canterbury settlement in 1851, divided the inhabitants into pilgrims, shagruns, and prophets; the first were the original colonists, the second were people from other parts of New Zealand, and the last were settlers from Australia.

During the first year of the Settlement, Canterbury was invaded by a body of sheep-farmers from Port Philip (Victoria) who were regarded by the settlers partly with admiration as successful Colonists, and partly with horror as disbelievers in the art of colonisation and the `Canterbury System'. The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the visitors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders.

Quote: <i>Prophet</i>.- Nickname of the Australian squatters who came down to Canterbury in 185(1) They were caled Ps. because they prophesied ruin for the farming pilgrims. It was they who finally persuaded Godley to authorise the squatting system here. See also <i>Shagroon</i>. (C.R., p. 5)

Quote: Not only did Australian sheep arrive, but during the 1850-60 period many Australian squatters (disgruntled by the fickle rainfall) also sold or abandoned their properties and migrated to New Zealand. These men arrived with capital to invest, with experience in colonial farming, knowledgeable of the peculiar habits of the Merino sheep, and with whole-hearted support of a `squatting' policy of land tenure based on the occupation of large areas of grazing country at low rentals. They became known as the `Prophets' because they forecast failure for the small-area arable farm plans of the established settlements.
