Quote: [Hdg] Plimmer's Ark back from the dead. A new chapter in the eventful saga of the <i>Inconstant</i> - the ship that became a building - has started following the recent opening of the new Plimmer's Ark Gallery on Queens Wharf... For many years life in Wellington basically revolved around the hulk of the <i>Inconstant</i>... Built in 1847 and launched on 3 Jan 1848 at Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, the <i>Inconstant</i> sailed to England and there had her hull clad with copper...On entering Wellington Harbour [in 1849] the ship ran on to the rocky beach between Pencarrow and the point now named Inconstant Point. The <i>Inconstant</i> was towed across the harbour to Te Aro. John Plimmer bought the by then derelict ship and had it moved in 1850 to Lambton Beach where he built a pitched roof over the mid section. It became known as Noah's [<i>sic</i>] Ark because of its appearance.

Quote: Plimmer's Ark is one of the most significant pieces of maritime history entrusted to the Maritime Archaeological Association. In 1977, construction workers digging in the old Bank of New Zealand building on Wellington's Lambton Quay discovered a slab of wood. Archaeologists identified it as part of the <i>Inconstant</i>, a ship that was towed into Wellington and was eventually bought by John Plimmer who dragged it ashore and modified it for use as business premises. The ship became known as Plimmer's Ark.
