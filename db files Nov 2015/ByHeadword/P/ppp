Quote: The Government is drawing a line between the leaked document that was Ross Armstrong's downfall and its support for public-private partnerships in general...

Quote: There's no getting away from PPPs now - public-private partnerships. They occur when a government needs major capital works done, but the work is on a scale that would seriously unbalance the public balance sheet. <i>Ibid.</i> 24 Essentially, the PPP term entered the national lexicon only with the Birch report for Auckland City Council in 2001. Treasury had also once suggested that a PPP variant might be a way of financing construction of the new hospital planned for Wellington.
