Quote: It is more than probable that Black has not a good character, and if one may imagine from what has been said, the Missioners don't look on Black as being a good, fond, loving spouse,that his domestic relations are not all pure merino, and that altogether the Black person is a kind of Stiggins who is not fitted to spread the `Word' to the heathens, the blind and unbelievers.
