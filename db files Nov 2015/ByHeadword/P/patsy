Quote: Opposition questions are generally designed to trip up or embarrass a minister, or at the very least to expose weaknesses in the Government's programme, while Government questions amount to little more than invitations to a minister to deliver a pre-written paragraph of Government spin. Such questions are known as "patsies" or "Dorothy Dix" questions, after an American journalist who wrote a famously platitudinous syndicated column giving advise to the lovelorn.
