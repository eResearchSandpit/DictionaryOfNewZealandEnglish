Quote: We went down a spur for two miles that was very soft from the late rain, and full of waterholes, called crab-holes. These holes were formed by the large snowgrass tussocks being burnt out roots and all, leaving a hole, or by the uprooting of trees, where the hole was very large ... In some places these holes made by(?) cattle mustering a most hazardous undertaking. In Mr Alex Garvie's report in 1858 he refers to `podge holes,' presumably a variety of `crab-holes.'
