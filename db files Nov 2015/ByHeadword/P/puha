Quote: A WEED that was ruthlessly removed by hand from corn crops in the Gisborne area has now become a crop itself with a market that covers the East Coast and Rotorua districts. This is the sow thistle, better known as `rauriki' in the Wellington district, which, marketed as `puha,' finds a ready sale at 1/- a bundle. There are two varieties, puha tiotio or prickly-leaved, and puha pororua, or smooth - leaved. [So Williams Dict 318]
