Pronunciation:
Notes: possibly from racing or bookmaking referring to the putting up or publishing the weights to be carried by horses so that punters can read the facts for themselves; or perhaps, from raising the handicap weights carried so making things more difficult both for the horse and for the bettor who fancies it: perhaps (though very unlikely) from a general analogy of tipping the balance, making the true weight (or, metaphorically, character) of somebody known, as one finds out a true weight literally when one `tips' old-fashioned scales by raising the weights and the thing to be weighed off the surface into a weighing position; ca1952 June Wellington I'll put his weights up with his cobbers tomorrow about his flirting.
