Quote: The documentary <i>Pokarekare Ana: A Maori Love Song</i>.. on the origins of the song, surrounds the contributions made by Sir Apirana Ngata and Paraire Tomoana with a misleading element of mystery... For a number of reasons, "Pokarekare" is unlikely tobeen the original work of either of these men. (1) "Pokarekare" was published in sheet music form in 1926 (twice), in 1927, 1936 and 1940 prior to Paraire Tomoana's death in 1946. The two 1926 versions are said to have been arranged by "Hemi Piripata" and "Alfred Hill": respectively. the 1927 version is said to have been arranged by "P H Tomoana and Archie Don". The 1936 version is said to have been "collected and sung by Ernest McKinley" and the 1940 version is again said to have ben arranged by "Hemi Piripata". in short, no published version of the song, including the 1919 booklet entry, gave any credit to either Apirana Ngata or to P H Tomoana for composing the song in their lifetimes... The most likely conclusion would seem to be that what has affectionately become "New Zealand's unofficial anthem" originated in the far north of New Zealand  circa 1900 and was adapted. modified and developed in its journey through the country by a number of gifted Maori composers of the day.

Quote: ...Tomoana explains the song's origin: "7. Pakarekare. These ditties emanated in the North of Auckland and were popularised in Narrowneck Camp, and eventually drifted to ... the East Cape. There they took the present form ... and acquired close association with the last drafts of single men from the East Cape and Wairoa districts ... the 19th and 20th Maori Reinforcements."

Quote: In 1978 I went with a Hamilton Teachers College kapa haka student group on a tour of Aboriginal settlements in Australia's Northern Territory... The group refused to include "Pokarekare Ana" in their repertoire because in their eyes the song had become a parody of the original, with "squashed banana" lyrics... At the Adelaide Festival, Rolf Harris asked us to accompany him in his latest hit, "Pokarekare Ana."... Anyone from Dame Kiri Te Kanawa down can sing "Pokarekare". It adds to the popular culture of New Zealand.

Quote: ...all too often what happens is someone gets sentimental and the song somehow stumbles on to become a mumbled medley involving "Pokarekareana". The full lyrics to which are "Pokarekareana Something Something Roto-rua".
