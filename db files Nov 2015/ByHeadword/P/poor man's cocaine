Quote: Speed has surpassed heroin and morphine to become the third largest problem for Wellington's drug and alcohol workers, after alcohol and marijuana. Known as "poor man's cocaine" - it's half the price with similar effects - it is often used by people in their late teens and early 20s who mix in the nightclub scene.
