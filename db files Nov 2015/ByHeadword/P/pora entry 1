Quote: Regarding the kumara and the pora; these were prized food plants grown by my ancestors in olden times .. They possessed the pora long before Europeans reached this land .. The pora mentioned by Tikao is evidently a turnip, and was probably obtained from early European voyagers at Queen Charlotte Sound.
