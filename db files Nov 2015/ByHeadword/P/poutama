Quote: The Rangiatea Church is being renovated, I hear, and the School of Art has been asked to reconstruct the arapaki work. It is I believe all poutama, and kakaho work, the real thing. We have assembled a lot of kakaho at Rotorua, material much cheaper than mock kakaho, but a little more difficult to handle.
