Quote: The operations of the gardener this month are very light, being chiefly in eradicating sow thistle, dock, plantain, and other weeds - collecting the flower seeds that have now ripened - cutting away withered stems, and staking the dahliahs and chrysanthemums.

Quote: PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie"-that is `Charles and George"- a souvenir of 1745.
