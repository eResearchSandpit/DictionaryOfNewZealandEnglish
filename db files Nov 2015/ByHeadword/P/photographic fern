Quote: Probably the most abundant filmy ferns are three species commonly associated. The first is the PHOTOGRAPHIC FERN  (<i>M[ecodium] sanguinolentum</i>) so named because when dried and pressed it leaves a brown stain on the paper accurately depicting its own form, even though light is not an agent in the process.
