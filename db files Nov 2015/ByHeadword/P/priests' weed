Quote: Thorn-apple (<i>Datura stramonium</i>), or, as it is still called in Hawke's Bay, `Priests' Weed', has on two occasions appeared at Tutira. As a plant likely to be of use in pulmonary affection, it was distributed in early days throughout the<i> pas</i> of Hawke's Bay by the Rev. Father Regnier of the Meanee Mission Station.
