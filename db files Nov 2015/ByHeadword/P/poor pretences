Quote: I saw some man sowing grass seed the other day on one of the public roads, and to satisfy an innate curiosity I asked him what it was. "It's what they call 'poor pretences,'" he said, "and bedad, sir, it's a very good name, for it is that same, for divil a one of it iver comes up that ivir I sees!"

Quote: In the early 'eighties occurred two dry seasons during which grass fires were run over the hot western and northern faces of certain portions on eastern Tutira; on the blackened ground then and once again seedlings of brome-grass (<i>Bromus mollis</i>) appeared in so great profusion that other grasses were temporarily submerged in hillsides of waving hay. [284] `Poor Pretences' was then the name by which this brome-grass was known on the east coast : it may be worth putting on record a suggestion as to how the plant came by such a curious designation. It was a `poor pretence' compared with ryegrass, cock's-foot, and white clover, the mixture sown then almost as a religious duty on Hawke's Bay runs, good and bad alike. So much for the sense; as regards the sound, `poor pretences' can, I think, only be a corruption of <i>Poa pratensis</i>; the Latin name of the one plant done into English has been fitted to another. The reader will recollect how this grass - more widely known as goose-grass - was sown wholesale over the trough of the run.
