Quote: ... the way to ask for a truce in a game is to call Pax ... At the school I went to, the word was <i>Fritz</i>, and the truce was terminated by the call <i>Fritz all over</i>, but we knew that some schools <i>used</i> Fans <i>(from south-west English dialect fain I </i>or <i>fainits ?</i>). Apparently some New Zealand schools use or have used <i>baldy</i>, which sounds like a variant of English <i>barley</i>.
