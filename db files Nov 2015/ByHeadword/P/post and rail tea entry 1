Quote: Post-and-Rail Tea, slang name for strong bush-tea: so called because the large bits of the tea, or supposed tea, float about in the billy, which are compared by a strong imagination to the posts and rails of the wooden fence so frequent in Australia. [1851]

Quote:  ... the tea was `of the commonest kind'. The brand was Young Green Hyson, but the [missionary] settlers nicknamed the foul brew `post and rails'. This was a reference to the twigs which floated about on the surface, large enough to form the posts and rails of a wooden fence.

Notes: from 1954 edition: Many of the old station cooks, with the assistance of an `offsider' (mate) found no difficulty in cooking for fifty or sixty men. .. it has to be remembered that .. bread cost only 6d. or 7d. a 4lb. loaf, and tea (post and rails) could be bought for 1/- per lb. Some of these contract cooks were great fossickers and managed to find quite a lot of green stuff for vegetables ...
