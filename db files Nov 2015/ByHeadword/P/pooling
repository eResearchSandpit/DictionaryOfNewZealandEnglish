Quote:  `Pooling' is much the same as binning except that a whole clip is group-classed with other clips whereas at present binning applies mainly to the oddments only. Only a few brokers pool wool for their clients, since in most cases interlotting and binning are considered sufficient devices to handle most small lines.
