Quote: We have positive evidence of two very distinct periods in the history of New Zealand - the period of the pit-dwellers, and the modern Maori period, which virtually closed when Cook rediscovered the group. That the greenstone ... was known to the ancient ... inhabitants is proved beyond question by the numerous articles found in the Pelorus district, contiguous to pit-dwellings, and beneath the roots of large forest trees. <i>Ibid.</i> 325 The abandoned pit-dwellings of the ancient Moriori inhabitants ... prove beyond question that much of the bush on the [326] shores of the Pelorus Sound was a regrowth.
