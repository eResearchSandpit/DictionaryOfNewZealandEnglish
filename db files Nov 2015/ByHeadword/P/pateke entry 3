Quote: MR F N HAYES holds one of two female brown teal or pateke ducks which are being airfreighted to a new home in England ... The pateke is a New Zealand species and was until the 1900s widespread. Since then numbers have been drastically reduced, through habitat destruction and by introduced predators, to a stage where it is in danger of extinction, with less than 1000 birds surviving. The birds will be settled at a wildlife sanctuary.
