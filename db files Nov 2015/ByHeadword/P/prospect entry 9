Notes: 1965 Bruce Branwell <I<TS</i>. of <i>Wapiti Hunters</i> (Note by Les Cleveland) 69 A party prospected for wapiti in the area between the Wapiti river and the Doon Valley. <i>Ibid.</i> 71. Five blocks and two prospecting blocks were offered in 1933. [Adj. usage is more common in the phrase <i>prospect blocks</i>, hence] 71 Three new coast blocks were opened to enable better coverage of the peninsulas between the alternate sounds. These were known as prospect blocks. The first parties to stalk these areas were, in most cases, entering country no stalkers had previously covered.
