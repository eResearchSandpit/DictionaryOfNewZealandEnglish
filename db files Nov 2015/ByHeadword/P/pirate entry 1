Quote: The last two cabs left in Auckland city [in 1983] who don't have installed radio telephones. Post- war legislation deemed that all new licensees have RT's. Some of the `old guard' didn't bother. They prefer to work off ranks. One of Auckland's better-known taxi drivers is a pirate -- `Waverley' Bill Claney -- so named because he used to hunt the old Waverley hotel rank. These days he's known by a new generation as `Kojak' --he declined an interview saying: `I'll be in touch when I want to write my memoirs'. Here's hoping Bill.
