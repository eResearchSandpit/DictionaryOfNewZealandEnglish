Quote: He was puzzled when a workmate called him a pronker. At first he thought he had been identified as a plonker, but found the word pronker was chosen deliberately. The South African verb pronk means to show off, as a springbok might do when it makes a spectacular leap, perhaps to score a try to win the World Cup.
