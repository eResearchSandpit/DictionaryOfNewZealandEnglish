Quote: At about 11.15 every morning we go through a piece of agony known as `Piccadilly'. All the New Zealanders in [? Sling] camp, three to four thousand strong, march along a certain section of the road in column of fours. On either side are about sixteen Sergeant Instructors, beautiful fellows, their superb figures almost bursting through their London tailor-made tunics. Their duty and pleasure it is to blast us up in a loud voice for any little irregularity of deportment they may notice or think they notice ...... The camp Commandant and half a dozen of the sherangs dressed in their best ... take the salute.
Notes: nf OED. P5.
