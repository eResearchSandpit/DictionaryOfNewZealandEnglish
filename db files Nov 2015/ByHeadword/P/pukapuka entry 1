Quote: <i>Pukapuka</i> - the word applied either to paper or books - at first sight appears to be derived from our English word <i>book</i>; it is not so, but from the large white leaf of the Pukapuka Rangiora (Brachyglottis repanda), to which the natives likened paper when they first saw it. They said, `He rau pukapuka tenei!' `Oh! this is a leaf of the Pukapuka.' The Greeks derived their [<i>biblos</i>] book, and the Latins their <i>Liber,</i> book, in a similar way, from the inner bark of the Linden or Teil tree, and the Egyptians theirs from the leaf of the Papyrus, whence comes our word paper.
