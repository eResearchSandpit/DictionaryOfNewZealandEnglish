Quote: <i> pluty</i> wealthy, but worse, perceived as assuming airs and graces above the level of the egalitarian Kiwi herd; refers also to suburbs that fancy themselves, such as Fendalton in Christchurch, Khandallah or Karori (`We are the Park Lane of New Zealand' overheard comment in London of a woman from Karori) in Wellington, Remuera in Auckland; comes from `plutocracy', the land barons of the South Island last century.
