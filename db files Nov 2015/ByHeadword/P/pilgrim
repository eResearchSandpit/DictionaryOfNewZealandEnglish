Quote: (`Pilgrims and Prophets') Gaily the pilgrim harnessed his plough, / When he had built up a roof o'er his head; / Singing, `From Albion hither I come;' / `Land of mine! land of mine! grow me some bread.'	Proudly the prophet flourished his crook, / When he had landed his sheep from the west; / Singing, `From Philipland hither I come;' / `Silly men! silly men! wool pays the best.'

Quote: Gaily the pilgrim harnessed the plough,/ ... / Singing, `From Albion hither I come;/ Land of mine! land of mine! Grow me some bread.'/ .../ Proudly the prophet flourished his crook,/ When he had landed his sheep from the West;/ Singing, `From Philipland hither I came;/ Silly men! Silly men! Wool pays the best'./ [13] Shortly the pilgrim and prophet agreed/ The plough and the crook couldn't live far apart;/
