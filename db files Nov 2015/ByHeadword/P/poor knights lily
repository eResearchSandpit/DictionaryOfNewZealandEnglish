Quote: The poor Knights lily is a member of the larger lily order, but the flower spikes look more like a scarlet bottlebrush, with leaves like a bearded iris. It was first found in 1924, and plant material which was collected first flowered in 1932 in cultivation. From the first flowering, seed was gathered, but none of the seedlings flowered until 1954.

Quote: She chose clumps of sword-like Poor Knights lilies, <i>Xeronema callistemon</i>, instead... Poor Kinghts lilies need full sun and excellent drainage and eventually - after seven to 10 years - produce spectacular, flaming-red bottlebrush flowers, too.
