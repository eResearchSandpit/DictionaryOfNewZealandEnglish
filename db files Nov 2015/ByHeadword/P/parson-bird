Quote:  ... but our parson bird being beyond reach held on his discourse with much nonchalance. Altogether this bird is a most remarkable one: clothed in feathers of deep black from head to foot, he wears a most grave and sacerdotal aspect. This is not all: he bears out closer the clerical resemblance by the possession of two pure white feathers under his chin, and the parody is complete when he commences to utter his guttural yet energetic notes. Sitting on the branch of a tree as a pro tempoire [????] pulpit, he wags his paw [????] and shakes his head, bending to one side, and then to another; as if he remarked to this one and to that one ... etc
