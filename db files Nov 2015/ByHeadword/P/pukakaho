Quote: They dwelt in whares [11] (huts) built in the traditional shape of an inverted V, roofed with grass, and lined inside with the reeds of the toetoe or New Zealand pampas grass. The orthodox Maori name for these reeds is pukakaho, but the white men called them `bukaka'. <i>Ibid.</i> 44 A potato was hollowed and a bukaka stem was inserted and the [pipe] owner puffed away.  <i>Ibid.</i> 139-140 One spot was marked by a lot of bukakas [140] (toitois) and when they drained it they found the skeleton of a saddled horse.
