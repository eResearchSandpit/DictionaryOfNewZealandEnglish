Quote: While my punui (<i>Stilbocarpa lyallii</i>) is out of its comfort zone, it had grown well for three years since it arrived as a seed from Putauhinu, one of the most southern titi (muttonbird) islands. Back on the mainland, my punui was growing well under the cover of a sinuous brachyglottis - until the heat of our La Nina summer overwhelmed it.
