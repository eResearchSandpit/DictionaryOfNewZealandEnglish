Notes: [? date] G.H. Scholefield (ed) NZ Parliamentary Record [?p] [Mr Seddon was first Premier to assume the title, which he did in 1899. It was officially used in the N.Z. Yr Bk of 1900+5 the Parliamentary debates of 1902, it was used in the constitutional debates in the 1st session of the 1st N.Z. Parliament in 1854, + it appeared in the schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873.] [check this] The operative date for the introduction of this term to official documents was August 1900, although from context in NZPD in which it was used (more than once) by Prime Minister Seddon (who was still addressed in Parliament as Premier during the debate), it appears to have been in some general use before that date.

Quote:  `INFORMATION,' of South Otago, disputes `Snippet's' statement (April 26) that Richard John Seddon was New Zealand's first Prime Minister on the grounds that the term `Prime Minister' was not used officially till New Zealand obtained Dominion status on September 26, 1907.  THE term `Prime Minister' was first used in New Zealand during a constitutional debate in New Zealand's first Parliament in 1854, and was subsequently used on many occasions during the late 19th century. In 1873, for example, in a schedule to the civil list, provision was made for the leader of the Government `being the Prime Minister.' The title `Prime Minister' was adopted officially in 1899 and Richard John Seddon was the first New Zealand Premier to use it. It was officially used in the New Zealand Year Book in 1900 and in Parliamentary debates in 1902.
