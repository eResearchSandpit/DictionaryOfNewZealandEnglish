Quote: ... there is only one job that the most fastidious could refuse, and that is `picking pie'. Tuis [?=This] consist [sic] in pulling the wool off the trimmings that have been taken off by the `wool pullers' at the beam. These trimmings are ... allowed to rot until the wool comes away easily. [Pie pickers] live and eat by themselves.
