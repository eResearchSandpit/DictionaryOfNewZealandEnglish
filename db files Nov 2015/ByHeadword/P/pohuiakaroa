Quote: SEA PERCH (<i> Sebastes percoides </i>). ... `The pohuiakaroa,' Dr. Hector says, `deserves mention, as it represents in these seas the genus to which the Norway haddock belongs. It is one of the most frequent and troublesome fish, caught in a moderate depth of water round the coast, and especially in rocky harbours, being almost worthless as food, and armed with so many sharp spines that it is a difficult task to detach it from the hook. It is the proper sea-perch of these waters.'
