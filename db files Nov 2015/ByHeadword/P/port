Quote: Telecom's general manager... said New Zealand already had well-functioning number portability, where consumers kept the Telecom number even if they changed to TelstraClear or another carrier and Telecom had a system of transferring (porting)) the call. Telecom charged the carrier $17.50 to set up the change and 0.5 cents a minute for any "ported" call.
