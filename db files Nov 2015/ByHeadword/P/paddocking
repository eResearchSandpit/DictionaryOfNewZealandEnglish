Quote: Workings [at Mount Ida, Otago, in 1871] were for the most part alluvial, the distinctive process used being `paddocking'. [fn] Paddocking was the systematic sluicing of large areas of flat ground from which the surface layers were first removed to reveal the `wash-dirt' beneath.

Quote: Paddocking: A square of ground was dug down to the paydirt layer. The paydirt was either extracted and worked in a pan, cradle or sluice box, or the paddock had one open end and was sluiced. Paddocks were often waterlogged and had to be continually bailed or pumped dry.
