Quote: Stray notes on Australia and the Diggings (Griffiths Collection) Origin of the word `Nugget'. - This word, now so common amongst our population, is a strange sounding word, and destitute of any apparent entymological meaning. It originated at the Ophir diggings in New South Wales, and is probably a corruption of `ingot', which is itself a corruption of `lingot', a little tongue. The wedge of gold which Achan purloined is called, in the original Hebrew, a `tongue' of gold, as a reference to a Bible with marginal readings will show. In California, the word `lump' is generally used, and sometimes the Spanish word `pepite.'
