Quote: In the lower regions the forest was much enlivened by birds. I shot some parrots [fn Nestor meridionalis. Kaka of the natives.], pigeons [fn Columba spadicea, Lath. Kukupa.], and wattle-birds [fn Glaucopis cinerea, Gmel. Kokako.]. Among the branches of the trees hopped the neat fantail flycatcher [fn Muscicapa flabellifera, Gml. Piwakawaka.], and a social bird of a yellow colour, which has been depicted by Forster [fn Orthornyx heteroclytus, Lef. Popokatea.], and which had much the habits of the finch.
