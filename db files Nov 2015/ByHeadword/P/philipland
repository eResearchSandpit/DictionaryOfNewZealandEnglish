Quote: Gaily the pilgrim harnessed his plough, / When he had built up a roof o'er his head; / Singing, `From Albion hither I come;' / `Land of mine! land of mine! grow me some bread.' Proudly the prophet flourished his crook, / When he had landed his sheep from the west; / Singing, `From Philipland hither I come;' / `Silly men! silly men! wool pays the best.'
Notes: (`Pilgrims and Prophets')
