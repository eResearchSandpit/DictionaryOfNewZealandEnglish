Quote: A person sued another for GBP2 for the detention of a paroquet.   The defendant's counsel asked that the plaintiff be non-suited, on the ground that the paroquet came under the head of <i>ferae naturae</i>, and that any such bird on escaping from its custodian became <i>res nullius</i>, and could not be the subject of larceny or a civil action.
