Quote: .. In a farming context it is usually a sugarbag made into an extemporised rucksack with some rope or a strip of flaxleaf. It can also be a chaff-sack, closed at both ends, and one side slit across at the centre and used with this side uppermost. Thrown across, either under or over the saddle, the two large saddlebags thus formed could be used to bring home some wool plucked from a dead sheep, or as a sheltered place to carry a weakling lamb.

When slung over the saddle it formed two large pockets in which the men carried their 'glad rags' or best clothes.
