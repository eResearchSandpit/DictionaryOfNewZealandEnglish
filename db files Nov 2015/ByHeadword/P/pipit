Quote: Family MOTACILLIDAE (pipits). The New Zealand pipit belongs to the same family as the European wagtail, but the Australian wagtail is a <i>Rhipidura</i>, like our fantail. Pipit is a dull brownish-grey streaky bird, inconspicuous until with a white flick of the outer tail feathers it rises from the ground.
