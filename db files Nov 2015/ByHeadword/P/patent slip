Quote: There was a fierce beauty about its scale, the precision of its movements, the way everything meshed to deliver the raw power to haul ships out of the water at the old Patent Slip in Evans Bay... Wellington Provincial Council let a contract for a slip in Evans Bay in 1868 but wrangling between the council and contractor stalled progress and the job was completed by the Wellington Patent Slip Company in 1873. For the next 96 years the slip hauled 6000 ships up the rails on its concrete incline - a total of more than two million tonnes deadweight.
