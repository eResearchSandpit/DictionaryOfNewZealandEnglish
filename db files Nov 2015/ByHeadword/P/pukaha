Quote:  ... they add what they call the Bugabuga or the Toga, and sometimes both. The Bugabuga is a very coarse covering made with little trouble, and affords a good shelter from cold or wet weather : The Toga is different and is equally calculated for use and elegance : The Bugabuga is formed round and converging to the top where there is an apperture just sufficient to admit the head to pass through, and when on, covers the body as low as the hip : If it storms, or they have occasion to stop where they have no other shelter they squat down upon their hams, and then the bottom of the Bugabuga reaching the ground, forms a shelter to the whole body (the head excepted) which looks in that situation as if it had been severed from a human form, and fixed upon a hay-cock.
