Quote: (Liver fluke of sheep and cattle occurs in parts of New Zealand, but this fluke, <i>Fasciola</i> is an introduced parasite whose intermediate hosts, the freshwater snails <i>Myxas Limnaea</i>, are also introduced. In New Zealand the adult fluke has been reported only in cattle, sheep and goats, in which unpleasant symptoms such as `pipey liver' and `bottle jaw' may occur. Black disease can kill a sheep within a few hours. The fluke concerned occurs in many parts of the world
