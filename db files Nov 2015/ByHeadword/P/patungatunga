Quote:  ... each carrying ... a great bunch of tawharas or, in autumn, patungatungas (flower and fruit of the kiekie vine) ... <i>Ibid.</i> 150 There was in spring the delicious tawhara, the fleshy edible flower of the kiekie vine, or later the still more delectable patungatunga, the ripened seed-pod of the tawhara.
