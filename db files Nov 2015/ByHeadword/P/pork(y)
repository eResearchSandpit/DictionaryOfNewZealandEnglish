Quote: Terms such as `moo-cow' and `baa-lamb' were not encountered once [among Maori schoolchildren]. In the light of this, it is interesting to note the common form `pork' or `Porky' for `pig'. This occurs several times and in contexts which would not lead one to suspect baby talk of any kind; <i>We just about got some pork.</i> This usage refers not to the meat, but to the living animals, and against this usage the form `pig' occurs only once. <i>Ibid</i> 105 <i>Please, it's a porky. I'm a pork</i> ... When they use [`pig'] themselves it tends to be only in derogatorative [sic] contexts; Get out of my sight, you dirty pig!
