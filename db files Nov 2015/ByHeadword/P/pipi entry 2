Quote: We looked in vain to see what is said to be seen on the hard sand between Opotiki and Wakatane [sic] - a green and white penguin, the Korora, (<i>Spheniscus minor</i>) taking a pipi shell to a great height, from whence it lets it fall on the beach, and then descends itself to pick out the flesh from the broken fragments of the shell.

Quote: Their true history, so far as it can be ascertained; their mythical history, which is abundant if collected, as to some extent it has been in the records of the Native Lands Court .. the records of their existence and works exhibited in the enormous pipi beds, and in their hangis, all over the country .. all these would tend to throw light on the history of the race.

Quote: Indeed, pipis abounded in many places along the main beach, while other shellfish made their homes on the rocks, and even when the winning of land from the sea had removed some of the sources of supply there were - right up to less than two decades ago - well stocked pipi beds at Pipitea and Evans Bay, and in Oriental Bay, where Maoris used to improve the shining hour by obtaining supplies, not only for their own use but for European tables - it was a common sight to see Maori women carrying flax kits of pipis from house to house for sale.

Quote: Even pipi does not mean the same thing all round New Zealand (a Stewart Island Maori of the older generation would use this name for the mussel) and it would mean nothing at all outside New Zealand. <i>Ibid.</i> 79 M [ytilus] planulatus [the smooth, navy-blue southern mussel]/ called pipi by the Stewart Island Maoris, goes down well if frothed up three times in a kerosene tin over a beach fire and then tipped out on fern leaves.
