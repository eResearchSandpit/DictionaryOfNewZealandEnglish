Quote: name given in Australasia to species of caterpillars which are attacked by spores of certain fungi; when chrysalating in the earth the fungus frows inside the body of the caterpillar, kills the latter, and then forces its way out between the head joints, and sends an upgrowth which projects beyond the surface of the ground and gives rise to fresh spores. Many examples are known, of which the more common are <i>Cordyceps robertsii</i>, Hook., in New Zealand; <i>Cordyceps gunni<i>i, berk, in Tasmania; <i>Cordyceps taylori</i> Berk, in Australia.<i> See</i> Aweto.

Quote: I remained in this forest till the 20th, finding many kauri grubs; while under the rata roots I also found the Aweta, or plant-caterpillar, which to change into a chrysalis creeps underground, and in many cases instead of becoming a moth becomes - a mushroom!

Quote: `The New Zealanders' name for this plant-caterpillar is `Hotete,' `Weri,' and `Anuhe'... The interior of the insect becomes completely filled by the inner plant, or thallus (mycelium): after which the growing head of the outer plant or fungus, passing to a state of maturity, usually forces its way out through the tissue of the joint between the head and the first segment of the thorax ... it is stated that this caterpillar settles head upward to undergo its change, when the vegetable developes [sic] itself.'
