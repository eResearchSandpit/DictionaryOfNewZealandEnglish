Quote: Like the Cuckoos in other parts of the world, they appear before rainy weather or coincident with it, and have thus come to be known in many widely different localities as `Rain-birds' and `Storm-birds'. In many parts of Otago and Canterbury they were called by the early settlers `Potato-birds', as they invariably came on the scene as the potato-planting was going on; similarly, in the North Island they got the name of `Kumara-birds'.
