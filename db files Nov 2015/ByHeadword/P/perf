Quote:  `Perfing out' for [dollars]80,000 [heading] The number of seemingly fit police quitting the force with average payouts of [dollars]80,000 under recently introduced medical discharge provisions is being criticised within police ranks. A total of 125 officers have been granted medical disengagement on the grounds they are no longer able to carry out police work. Several have then taken up similar investigative work in the private sector. The medical option is colloquially known within the police as `perfing out', based on the acronym of the scheme's original name - police employment rehabilitation fund.
