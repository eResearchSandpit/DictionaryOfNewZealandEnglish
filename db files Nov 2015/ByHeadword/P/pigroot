Quote:  Only think how much more graceful all the landscape will appear. / No more pigroots, whalebacks, hogbacks - these names that shall not last; / ... <i>Negro-heads</i> shall be re-christened. I for one will take no heed, / While to me there yet remaineth Negrohead, the fragrant weed.

Quote: No map the collector has consulted has shown Pigroot Hill or hotel, and yet it is the most prominent and most used name between Palmerston and Kyeburn. Again and again the collector has heard the remark, `I am going into the Central by the Pigroot,' or `I came down by the Pigroot.' So frequently is it used that one might imagine that certain people used it thinking that the word `root' is in reality `route,' but be that as it may, common usage is the deciding factor in place-names, and Pigroot, with its associations back into the fifties, has come to stay. The name was originally [9] bestowed because the wild pigs rooted up the hillside looking for the roots of the taramea, or speargrass, which they enjoy eating, and which is probably one of the main reasons why speargrass is so rare nowadays.
