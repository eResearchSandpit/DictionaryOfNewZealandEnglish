Quote: The only means of getting sawn timber was to cut it yourself, by what was called pit sawing. Dad used to make a pit about 20 ft long, and 6 ft deep, place logs around it, roll the logs he wanted sawn into position in the middle... Dad's mate used to go into the pit and dad, who was the taller, stood on top of the log. Dad had to drive the saw downwards, and his mate pulled it, and up and down they sawed, squared the log, cut boards and four by two and so on until they had  sufficient timber for rafters, uprights and floor joists.
