Quote: Pohutukawa are our remarkable trees - the symbol of New Zealand, as the oak is the emblem of England. Like the oak, the pohutukawa has a short, stout gnarled trunk that becomes beautifully gnarled with time, the wide-spreading branches forming a most stately and memorable tree... The name "pohutukawa" comes from "hutukawa" (a head-dress of red feathers) and "po" which has meany meanings, including night or underworld. Governor Grey interpreted this as meaning "the tree with red adornment near the sea", but "po" could equally be a reference to the traditional tree at Cape Reinga where the spirits of the dead descend via the pohutukawa tree to a secret cave, the entrance to Te Reinga, the spirit or underworld [sic]. A small, scrubby version still clings to the cliff edge at the leaping-off place of the spirits. In Maori, to say someone "has slid down the pohutukawa root" is a lyrical way of saying he has joined the ancestors.
