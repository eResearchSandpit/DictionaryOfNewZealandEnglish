Notes: Note on conversation with Deidre Macken (60 yrs) about her mother's story (86 yrs). She was in the Wellington Ballet Company in 1926 and on news of Pavlova's tour wrote to her manager enquiring how they could help make her tour and reception more pleasant, her favourite colours, foods, etc. She expressed a great liking for meringue (cakes) so they consulted a chef who produced 3 attempts (e.g. a square cake was rejected in favour of a round one); finally the `soft-centre' variety was chosen. In her honour they named it Pavlova (?cake) and they presented this to Pavlova (? at a gathering) and she liked it a great deal. D. Macken is to research this - ? Ballet company records, etc. Deidre Macken (04) 384-6073 -  H.D. Macken, Nairn St.

Quote: The Editor,The DominionPavlova - Name and NatureSir, -- In spite of silly claims regularly surfacing especially in Australia (Dominion 2/2/99), the facts of the development of the confections and the date the name `pavlova'  was applied to them have been reasonably well known for some years now. They may be found in the Dictionary of NZ English (1997), the Australian National Dictionary (1988), and the writings of Professor Helen Leach of Otago University.The name `pavlova' post-dated the ballerina Pavlova's Australasian tour of 1926, and was first applied in New Zealand by the Davis Gelatine Company in 1927 to a jelly dessert whose moulded multicoloured shape may have suggested a tutu. It was next (in 1929) applied independently (and only  in NZ) as `pavlova cake' or `sponge' or `meringue' to the previously well known so-called `meringue cake' or `sponge'. The recipe change to the legendary pavlova icon is usually reputed in NZ to be the addition of vinegar to give the soft centre, and in Australia, the trademark of passionfruit in the topping. (The name `pavlova' does not occur in either the Futter book (1926) or the Terrace Tested Recipes (1927) mentioned in your report.)The elliptical simple form `pavlova' for the meringue is recorded earliest in Australia from 1940 (so AND, two of whose quotations acknowledge NZ as the originator) and in NZ from 1953 (DNZE).There is no evidence that the name `pavlova' was applied in Australia before 1940.  Both countries share the earliest recorded date 1966 (and the same quotation) for the abbreviation `pav'.The New Zealand Dictionary Centre at Victoria University (Box 600, Wellington) would be glad of any pre-datings of any of the above, with author, title, date, and page references.Harry Orsman
Notes: Check date of publication. "Terrace Tested Recipes collected by the Ladies of Terrace Congregational Church" was published by Whitcombe & Tombs in 1927 (191 pp). There were three editions in 1927; the first is held by Turnbull, the 3rd was held by Te Papa (Hector Library) but recent report (HO) says they no longer have it.

Quote: Contrary to what they'll tell you in Perth, Western Australia, Bert Sache, a chef at the Esplanade Hotel did not invent the pavlova. All he did, in 1935, was to make a meringue and cream cake that he said was "light as Pavlova", the Russian ballet dancer who six years earlier had stayed at the hotel. but the name stuck and thus was born the myth about its origins. The truth is that the large meringue with the marshmallow centre - the heart of the pavlova - was common in New Zealand in the early 1930s, even earlier. In 1927, for instance, there was a recipe for a meringue cake submitted by a Mrs McRae in the second edition of <i>Terrace Tested Recipes</i>, collected by the ladies of the Terrace Congregational Church in Wellington.

Quote: The breakthrough [to substantiate New Zealand's claim for first use of the word] came in 1929, when the <i> NZ Dairy Exporter Annual </i> published the first known recipe for "Pavlova Cake" as we now know it. Granted, the recipe was for a two-layered pavlova, but this, after all, is a common variant ...
