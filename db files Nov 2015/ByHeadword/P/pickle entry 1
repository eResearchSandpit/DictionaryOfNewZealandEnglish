Quote: Pickle can usually be used in a broad sense to encompass any food that is preserved in brine or  vinegar, which explains the use of the word by supermarkets to mark the relevant aisle. However, in traditional New Zealand preserving, the word pickle is usually reserved for preserves in which the pieces of fruit or vegetable remain separate, most obviously in onions and gherkins, but also in chow chow and picalilli in which the vegetables are preserved in a thickened mustard sauce.
