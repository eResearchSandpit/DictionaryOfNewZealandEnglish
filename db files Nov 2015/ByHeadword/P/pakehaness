Quote: ... but you can't bring your pakehaness into my home unless I say so and I won't! This is a Maori home ... bringing up his children to be Maoris and not half-pie imitation pakehas. <i>Ibid.</i> 73 What, after all, was wrong? It was his Pakehaness. ... What is wrong with the Negroes is their Negroness. What is wrong with the Chinese is their Chineseness. What is wrong with me is my Maoriness.
