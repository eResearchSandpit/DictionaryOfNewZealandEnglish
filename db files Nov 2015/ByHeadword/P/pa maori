Quote:  `I'm not just a <i>pa</i> Maori, I've been about. Once I went to Sydney and they took me on in a <i>cafe[e-acute], ... But what's it like up at the pa</i>? I'll tell you: it's like being shut up with a lot of big kids. They say; `That Opal, she's not a Maori now, she's got a hat and thinks she's a <i>pakeha'</i>.'
