Quote: Kiwis still aspire to `pav' property. The average New Zealander still aspires to a slice of the great New Zealand property pavlova, says Roger Hallinan, the new president of the New Zealand Institute of Valuers. He says more than two decades have passed since political scientist, and now UK Labour MP, Austin Mitchell, described New Zealand as a quarter-acre, pavlova paradise.
