Quote: ...Tom says I am a sheeler for playing Poor Jenny ... My spelling cannot have improved much with the years for I had to look up the dictionary to find whether one spelt the word `sheila' or `sheilagh'. Of course `Poor Jenny' or `Poor Sally', as it is perhaps better known, was and no doubt still is a girl's game. As I had three doting sisters I cheerfully joined their games when my boy friends were not looking. Remember the words of the song? Poor Sally is a-weeping, a-weeping, a-weeping, Poor Sally is a-weeping, On a bright summer's day. On the carpet she shall kneel While the grass grows in the field - Stand up, stand up, upon your feet, And choose the one you love so sweet. Then followed `the moment of truth' and with girl and boy standing demurely in the middle of the ring of children, the circle danced around them singing: Now you're married I wish you joy, First a girl and then a boy. I forget the final words, if any. Usually this game was followed by `Ring-a-ring a rosie, Pop down a posie.' Strange, though, how the love-making aspect would come into many of these old games. I must have been a pronounced `sheeler' about this time because I also remember joining in the singing of I sent a letter to my love And on the way I dropped it, Some of you have picked it up And put it in your pocket. Dropped it - dropped it! And so on. A year or two later at the mellowing age of 10 years I abhorred all these `sissy' games though I still had a hankering to play `Oranges and Lemons', even at the great age of 12.
