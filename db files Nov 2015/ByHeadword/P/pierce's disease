Quote: Pierce's Disease, the latest outbreak of agricultural pestilence to rattle the West, is relentlessly tearing through Californian vineyards, worrying winemakers around the world, not least in Australia and New Zealand, for whom California's wine culture has long been a source of inspiration and grapevines... Pierce's Disease is caused by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, a bacteria that lives in the xylem of plants, the thin layer beneath the surface that transports water and nutrients from the roots.
