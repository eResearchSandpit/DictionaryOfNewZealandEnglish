Quote: The Perishable, introduced some time during the mid-twenties, was an express goods train that ran between Christchurch and Greymouth - in both directions - on six nights of the week. As well as its usual duties, the train provided a convenient weekend service for Canterbury Mountaineering Club members travelling to Arthur's Pass.
