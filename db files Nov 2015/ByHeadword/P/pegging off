Quote: PEGGING OUT A CLAIM ...Mr Neave, in opening, stated that the informant, at the request of Donald Simson, who held a miner's right, and was an applicant for a mining privilege, proceeded to defendant's perpetual leasehold at Waikaka, for the purpose of pegging off a mining claim. Defendant refused to allow the pegging to go on, threatened informant with a crowbar, and with it knocked the pegs from his hand.
