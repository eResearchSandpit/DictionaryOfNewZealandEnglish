Quote: "Kaituna," a locality of great repute for this staple article of the aboriginal's food, prior to the introduction of the "poaka" (pig), and the nearest approach to flesh (literally, eat eels) but probably intended to convey the idea of its being a noted fishing ground for this, to them, delicious and life-sustaining commodity - let us hope that it may remain undisturbed.

Quote: Betty replied, "she has come for her pig;" Brown said "I have not seen your pig;" I then went outside the house, and stayed out there a little while, when the pig grunted; I called "poaka poaka," and the pig grunted a good deal; the noise came from a little house behind; I went to the house, and saw the pig inside grunting to me; I opened the door, and I found that the pig had been marked; the ear was cut, and the tail was cut off; the blood was quite fresh, it having been recently done; I examined the pig, and found it was the same that I had missed.

The native name is poaka; and although English [50] men think this word to be their own `pork,' with a native termination (porka), I am doubtful whether the New Zealanders had not some knowledge of this animal previous to its introduction by us. <i>Ibid.</i>  2/379 Poaka - pig, swine
