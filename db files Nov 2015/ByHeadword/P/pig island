Quote: The New Zealand wild pigs supposedly descended from farm animals brought here by James Cook gave rise.. to the coloquial but unflattering <i>Pig Islands</i> (or less logically <i>Pig Island</i>), which is found from 1906, and is well known.. from James K. Baxter's.. poem sequence <i>Pig Island Letters</i> (1966). A <i>DNZE</i> citation from 1946 reports <i>Pig Island</i> as an Australian usage, but there is no entry for it in <i>AND</i>.
