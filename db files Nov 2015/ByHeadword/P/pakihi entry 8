Quote: Most of [the gold-seekers] ... begged me to leave them flour enough for at least one day, which I did, ... as I had been assured ... that I should be able to obtain new provisions at the so-called Pakihi, a large forest meadow near Lake Brunner. <i>Ibid.</i> 82 After a mile and a half we came out of the high forest and the pakihi or paddock lay before us. This is the name given by the diggers to a grass-covered plain between one and two miles broad, bordered on both sides by thickly wooded mountains. This place, generally so desolate, was now highly animated. Cattle and horses were grazing peacefully in all directions. Numbers of tents were put up near the forest for the accommodation of gold-diggers, cattle-drivers, and storekeepers.
