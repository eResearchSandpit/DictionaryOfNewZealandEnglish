Quote: "As to the claim, I think it has been proved already that the gold is there, but it seems as if it is going to be patchy, or rather we are only going to get the gold in patches... If we could get a continuous week's work on a patch such as we have had it would yield over 1000oz for the week. .."

Quote: It appears the Try Again party .. became more fortunate, striking on to a nice little patch, and .. secured 21oz before they discovered it was probable they were over their boundary...  the rush at Storey's Gully has not yeilded much, as the ground seems very patchy.

Quote: It would seem as if two prospectors had the good fortune of "stiking" a patch of the precious metal...  Tucker Hill was always patchy and always poor, and it is not likely that the late [sic] find will lead to the discovery of any extensive auriferous deposit...  In my opinion the Tucker Hill find is but a patch...
