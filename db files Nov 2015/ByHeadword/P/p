Quote: The methamphetamine explosion has coincided with the appearance of a highly pure form of the drug, known on the streets as P. It is sold in crystalline form - like crack cocaine - and is 70%-80% pure... While powder speed is snorted, users heat P in the bottom of a glass pipe and inhale the smoke - a similar process to taking crack.
