Quote: `There are two plants, the karo (prickly thorn) and taramea (spear grass). which are well worth of their names, but are almost exclusively confined, that is, the larger varieties, to the hilly regions. There gen erally grows near these a plant called tikuma (cotton- or leather-plant) from the leaf of which the natives make mats and leggings, which are impervious to the sharp points of the former ...' TCS, par. 51.
