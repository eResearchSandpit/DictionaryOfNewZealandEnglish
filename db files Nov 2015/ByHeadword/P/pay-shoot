Quote: Upon this a shaft was sunk to a depth of 20ft. showing the lode-matter to be well defined throughout, the shoot of pay-ore which was carried down for 16ft. appearing to pitch towards the north. This ore-shoot appears to have characterized by the occurrence in considerable quantities of richmondite, which appeared in stringers 3in. to 7in. in thickness. High values in silver, ranging from 2 oz. to 1,700 oz. to the ton, were carried in this pay-shoot.
