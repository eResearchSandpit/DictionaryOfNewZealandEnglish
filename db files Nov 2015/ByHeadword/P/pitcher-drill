Quote: <i>Pitcher-drill</i>: A short drill-steel of large diameter used to `pitch' or start a drill-hole. When using the drifter, the pitcher-drill had to be firmly held in position by the man at the nose of the machine until it had bitten far enough into the rock to remain there. Once the hole was pitched the drill was re-aligned on the hole and drilling continued.
