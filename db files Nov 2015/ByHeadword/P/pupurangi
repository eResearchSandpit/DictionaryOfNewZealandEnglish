Quote: Sir, - I am informed that there exists in New Zealand a whistling snail, called by the Maoris a pupurangi. .. I am told this snail is a tree-climber, and that the natives procure them by posting themselves below the trees in which the pupurangi are located, and that on their whistling to them the snails fall to the ground, and are then greedily devoured by their captors, as their flavour is said to be curiously delicious.

Quote: The Maoris call it pupurangi, snail of the skies - I suppose because the shell is sky-blue inside or because they found it up in the trees.
