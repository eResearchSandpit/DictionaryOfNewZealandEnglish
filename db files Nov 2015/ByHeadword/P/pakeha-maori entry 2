Quote: Maori is a very beautiful language; and English is not a bad one as languages go; but that delightful 'patois' called Pakeha-Maori, which is the vulgar tongue among half-castes, loafers, missionaries, Maori doctors, and other kinds of vagabonds in the North Island, goes beyond either of its component roots for breadth of expressions, and euphony of sound. In Maori again no two consonants occur together, so that in using English words in Pakeha-Maori, a vowel must always be stuck in between consonants where they happen to meet.
