Quote: The next job is <i>plucking,</i> cutting out the lungs and heart [?which, or at least the lungs, are hanging or `dropped' down), and going on the neck, and is done by the <i>plucker</i> or <i>plucky</i> [?pluck = heart or offal]. At Feilding <i>plucking</i> is quite a job, with pride and style attached to it, brandishing the knife with professional skill, etc.
