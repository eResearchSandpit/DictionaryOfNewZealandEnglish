Quote: To [the locals], the most striking thing about these foreigners was their white skin. This feature was a characteristic of creatures known to them as Patupaiarehe, the fairy-like inhabitants of the forest. These white-skinned beings of the imagination were also known as pakepakeha and pakehakeha. These words are the direct antecedents of the word Pakeha. There is nothing pejorative about this derivation of the meaning and use of the word Pakeha to denote the white strangers who came to these shores in the 18th century.
