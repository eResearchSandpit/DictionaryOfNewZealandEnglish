Quote: PERKING is the name for fringe benefits that are taken by employees and should not be confused with the `perk' that is an authorised addition to a salary. The word originated on the floor of the factory but the practice is not confined to that area. Those who make a habit of perking don't consider it dishonest but factory owners disagree and waste time and effort trying to stamp it out.
