Quote: CREEPING MALLOW (<i>Modiola multifida</i>), called also red mallow and ground mallow, is abundant on roadsides and waste places in both islands. It is perennnial, has creeping stems lying flat on the ground and rooting every inch or two, and running to a length of 2 ft. ... It is actually mistaken for scarlet pimpernel in some districts.
