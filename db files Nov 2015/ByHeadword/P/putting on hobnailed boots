Quote: A fortnight before its sittings, Mr. Peter Proudfoot, Chief Commissioner of Lands, died, and the Superintendent appointed his own son-in-law, Mr. Cutten, to the vacant post, which was in the gift of the Executive and should have been filled by them. In his opening speech to the Council he justified this action, or rather rode roughshod over any objections to it. `Now,' he said, `I would have Mr. Cutten and all others to know that I am in no degree to be swayed from doing what I have a right to do - to put the right man into the right place - whether that man happens to be my son-in-law or any one else' - a mode of speech now known amongst politicians as `putting on hobnailed boots.'
