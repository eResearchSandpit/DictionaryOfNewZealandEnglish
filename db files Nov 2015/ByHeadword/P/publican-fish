Quote: GLOBE-FISH <i>Contusus richei</i> (Freminville) ... It has several other popular names such as Balloon-fish and Mouse-fish. In America it is known as Rabbit-fish and Stink-fish. The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. ... The most witty name, Publican-fish given to it by Australian fishermen, is said to have originated from the resemblance of an inflated Globe-fish to the rotundity of many successful publicans.
