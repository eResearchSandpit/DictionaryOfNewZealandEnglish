Quote: There are fat white cucumbers, known as Port Albert cucumbers, which grow all around the Kaipara district. The seeds are said to have been left behind by summer picnickers dining on cucumber sandwiches. The cucumber's skin turns yellow with age, but the flesh stays juicy, without any bitterness.
