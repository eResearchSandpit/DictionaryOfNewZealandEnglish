Quote: Surat Bay on the Catlins coast is now the most accessible site for viewing the New Zealand sea lion/pakeke, making it a very special place indeed. During Conservation Week 2007 interpretation panels will be unveiled that trace the return of pakeke and explain how visitors should behave around them.
