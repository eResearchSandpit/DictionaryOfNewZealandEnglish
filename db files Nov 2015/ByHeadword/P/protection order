Quote: Even the Dictionary of New Zealand English (DNZE) (1997) is patchy in its coverage of legal terms, having for example no entry for disputes tribunal, family protection, incorporated society, Maori option, protection order, resource consent.    The most recent edition of Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (1995) is useful but commonly gives specialist   definitions   taken   from   the interpretation sections of statutes
