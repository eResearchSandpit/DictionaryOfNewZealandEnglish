Quote: [Birds S.W.] Besides being a jack of all trades, this bird has a variety of names, no two people being agreed as to which is correct. The Maories call it the bu-ka-ka - is this spelling correct? Some people call it the coote, from some fanciful resemblance to the water hen of the Old Country. Swamp hen it is generally called in Westland, but I have heard it also called bald pate and New Zealand Turkey.
