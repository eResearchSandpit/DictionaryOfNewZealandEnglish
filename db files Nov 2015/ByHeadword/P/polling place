Notes: Jim Cameron writes : See Electoral Act 1993 s. 155. The British equivalent is <i>polling station</i>>. Popularly a polling place is often referred to as a <i>polling booth</i>, which has the distinct legal meaning of a room within a polling place. For each polling booth the Returning Officer for the electorate appoints a <i>deputy returning officer (DRO)</i>. The corresponding perrson in Britain appears to be known as a <i>presiding officer</i>.
