Quote: When a shearer finishes a sheep, the <i>f</i>. is left lying on the <i>board</i> (q.v.). It is <i>picked up</i> by a boy (the <i>f.-p.</i>), who carries it to a table throws it out flat to be skirted, rolled and classed. The verb, to<i> f.-pick</i>, means `to be a fleece-picker'. To <i>p. up</i> is to do the actual <i>job. </i>

Quote: There was nothing new to me in picking up fleeces. ... I had often given a hand in the smaller woolsheds at shearing time, either penning up with the shepherds or picking up and helping the presser.

Quote: picking up fleeces: the rouseabout (shearer's hand) picks up the newly-shorn fleece, throws it so that it lands spread out on the table, pulls off the short and dirty wool which had been under the belly (<i>bellies</i>), rolls the fleece and puts it into the press. Nowadays the shearer usually shears the belly separately before starting on the fleece.

Quote: ... I was allowed to miss school to help in the shed by picking up the bellywool and removing the pizzle stains from the wether bellywool. I was also `tar-boy', which meant putting dabs of Stockholm tar on any cuts inflicted by the shearers.
