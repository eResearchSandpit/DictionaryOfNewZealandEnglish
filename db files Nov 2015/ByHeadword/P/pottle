Quote: Many people here in the South Island, where the best strawberries are grown, refer to a small strawberry container as a pottle. On the June 29 programme one of the teams gave the answer `pottle' to a question about what small strawberry containers were called, and were then penalised for a wrong answer. Their puzzled expressions were quite understandable to anyone living south of Cook Strait.
