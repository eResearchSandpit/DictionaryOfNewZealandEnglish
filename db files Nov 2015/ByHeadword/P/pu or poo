Quote: When the Ngati Awa arrived in the late 1820s, the people of Karaka knew nothing of guns, and when some fugitives from the various settlements in Kura Te Au (Tory Channel), brought tidings that a taua from the North Island were killing people with 'Pu'(which meant a strong wind or explosive breath), they scoffed, "Let them come!" "We have plenty 'pu'"...  The deadly effect of the 'pu' caused great consternation in the Pa.
