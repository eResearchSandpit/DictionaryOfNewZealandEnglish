Quote: Fr Delaney said: "I did not know till recently that trout fishers are accustomed to take a priest with them when they go for a catch. They take a wooden mallet or other weapon with them and use it for the last rites when the fish is in its final struggle. And the mallet is called a priest.Nor did I know, until a book of angling, 1880, told me, that an all-purpose fisherman's fly called a priest is likely to make a good catch."
