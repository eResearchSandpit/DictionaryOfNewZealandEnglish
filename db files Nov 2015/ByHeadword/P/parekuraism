Quote: The remarkable feature of this row has been Horomia's style. His parliamentary answers were impenetrable. Having tried to deconstruct dozens of Parekura-isms, I have developed a theory: he tries to say several sentences at once. He can't bear to pick which sentence to say first, in case someone interrupts him, before he's managed to say the others. So he blurts it all out as a compound.
