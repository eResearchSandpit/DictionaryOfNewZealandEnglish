Quote: The distinction between a. Plunket nurse and a Karitane is an important one. Plunket nurses must be registered nurses before they embark on the 17-week Plunket training course and they often have additional midwifery or nursing qualifications. Karitanes have basic child-care training with no nursing qualification required.

Quote: We lived out in the wop-wops then - on a rehab place, miles from town up a metal road. Apart from a mate on the next farm I didn't have much to do with anyone outside the family. There was the Plunket Nurse, of course, when the baby was little. And the Bon Brush man, and a few other salesmen.
