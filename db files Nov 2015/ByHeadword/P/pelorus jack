Quote: One or two five- or six-feet members of the finny [t]ribe were caught by caterers for the camp at School Bay, and it is reported that " Pelorus Jack" has forsaken his old haunt outside the Heads, where for many months he has patiently awaited a victim, to forage in Queen Charlotte Sound; at any rate passengers from Nelson to Picton no longer see the curious creature disporting itself at the heads, and, so the story goes, a huge black fin like a cross cut saw leaves a long wake in divers places in the Sound.

Quote: While many believed he was guiding ships safely through the treacherous waters of French Pass, Mr Webber said Pelorus Jack didn't enter the pass at all... For Maori, the dolphin's history goes even further back than the 1880s. It is believed Pelorus Jack, known as Kaikaiawaro (food of the deep) to Maori, escorted descendants of Ngati Kuia into Pelorus Sound hundreds of years later.
