Quote: WAITAHANUI About 11 kilometres South of Taupo, the highway crosses this famous stream alongside the Lake. The `rip', where the stream enters the lake, attracts dozens of anglers who are content to stand waist-deep and shoulder-to-shoulder. Collectively, these enthusiasts are known as `The Picket-Fence.'
