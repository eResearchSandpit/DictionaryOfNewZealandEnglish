Quote: <i>GENIOSTOMA LIGUSTRIFOLIUM, hangehange</i>. A common, lightly branched shrub of lowland forest margins and track-sides in the North Island ... The waxy-surfaced, apple-green leaves ... might commend this as a desirable garden shrub were it not that the small greenish flowers, ... have an odd smell that gives rise to the name `pigwood' in some districts.
