Quote: 1980 saw the introduction of a new stratigraphic parameter, the Percy.  No longer do geologists illustrate the scale of the outcrop photographs with such mundane objects as hammer, lens caps, 2 cent pieces and bananas.  If in the forefront of geological technique they now take as an essential item of field equipment, Percy Strong.  Such is Percy's usefulness as a unit of stratigraphic thickness, and so great is the magnetism of his image on screen, that one lecturer introduced his choicest slide with the pronouncement "that's Percy", and only then proceeded to describe the rocks.  It is understood that Cathy, with callous disregard for the visual effect on her husband's figure, is knitting for Percy a cap-a-pie jumpsuit with 100 horizontal stripes so that thin-bedded sequences may be measured in centi-Percies (cPe); and further that Percy himself now steers clear of field trips in areas of steeply-dipping strata, to avoid the necessity of being photographed in a horizontal position in stream beds.
