Quote: All people who live in urban industrial societies have their lives requlated by measured time. This concept of time is referred to by Maoris as `Pakeha time' and they conform to its dictates inasmuch as they are on time for work, to catch buses or to fulfil engagements. However, because they are bicultural, Maoris function in their own time-frame as well, which they refer to as `Maori time'.

Quote: The hardest part was getting started. No sooner had I cast Don Selwyn from Wellington as the old man, and Thomas Ratima from Napier as Matt, then, as if intent on proving right the stereotype about `Maori unreliability', they both disappeared without trace. They turned up in the end, of course, and, just to prove me prejudiced and wrong, subscribed more rigorously than anyone to `pakeha time'; but meanwhile I was driven to desperation trying to find the other twenty or so Maoris needed to complete the cast.
