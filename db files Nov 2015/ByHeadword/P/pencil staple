Quote: It is not uncommon to find that fleeces which have a high expression of staple character also have lean or pencil type staples, particularly on the fore-arm and the britch. Wool buyers and their manufacturers have no objection to these pencil staples, but with breeders they find little favour, and a sheep is expected to produce meaty staples throughout the fleece.
