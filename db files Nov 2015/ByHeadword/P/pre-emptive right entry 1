Quote: As to the preemptive right, please send me the best description you can of what we should apply for. We have a right to <i>`80 acres at one of the stations and 10 acres at each of the other stations erected upon the run'</i> ... It seems, however, that there must be a station of some sort at the place where preemptive is applied for; but it would be easy to have a hut put up at any place where we wanted to take our land.

Quote: Why shouldn't he, the first arrival, have the right to take up his pre-emptive option? ... he made the most of it when he appeared before the Waste land Board on February 11 and 13, 1863. `It was about four months ago,' he told the board ..., `that I realised I would be upset by gold-diggers. As a result I have been forced to apply for my pre-emptive rights sooner than I would otherwise have done.'

Quote: A pastoral licensee could use his, and rarely her, pre-emptive rights to lock up the land along a mile of road for the cost of the fencing, say GBP60, when to buy the same land outright would cost a settler GBP600 .. in some cases huts and fences would be erected to obtain a pre-emptive right over the adjacent land after which they were pulled down and put up elsewhere to enable fresh claims to be made.
