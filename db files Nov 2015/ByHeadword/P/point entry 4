Notes: Jim says definitions in British dictionaries relate <i>point</i> to the  seacoast (headland, cape, promontory - "a high point jutting out into the sea"). NSOD gives as <i>chiefly US</i> "a tapering extremity of land etc.. constituting a geographical feature". This echoes the common use of point in NZ in <i>inland</i> placenames e.g. Arthur's Point, Awakino Point, Pleasant Point, Titoki Point, Ti-tree Point." I have not noticed any inland "Points" in England or in a cursory skim through British gazetteers. This use of the word may be worth followng up.
