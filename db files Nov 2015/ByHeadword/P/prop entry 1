Quote: In London the swells in the park drive all round, / But the diggers drive here with a pick underground; / And the props that they use, surely everyone knows / Ain't the same used in London for hanging up clothes.   / The women use fans* there, the men use them here, / Though to cockneys that statement may sound very queer, / And the fellows that frequently hang round hotels, / Out here are called loafers, at home are called swells. -->[p 89 fn] * A fan is a machine for pumping air down the shafts.
