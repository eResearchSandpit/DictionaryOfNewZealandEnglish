Quote: After Alofoe's suicide, A Block inmates began `a prop'. One man started a hunger strike and others planned to join him after 39 days (then the average time span between Paremoremo's suicides), and refuse food indefinitely. ... The original unpublished plan involved a mass `prop' by all Paremoremo inmates. But many were not enthusiastic about a strike on this scale, and feared the consequences.
