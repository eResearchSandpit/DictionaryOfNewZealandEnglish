Quote: Food and gear have to be carried. Everyone in New Zealand, almost everyone anyway, puts it in a <i>pack</i>, but probably no one stops to think that the word <i>pack</i> in this sense is not standard English. ... England since 1895 has borrowed <i>rucksack</i> from German dialect; New Zealand has preferred <i>pack</i>. Not that rucsac is not used here; it is noticeable that older Club members used it in several articles in early numbers of <i>Tararua</i>, and it still appears in advertisements. <i>Rucksack</i> seems a bit foreign, as is shown by the less correct but more foreign-looking spelling it is usually given. <i>Pack</i> as a synonym for <i>rucksack</i> is used in Australia to some extent at any rate. This sense of <i>pack</i> would most likely be in use long before it occurred in print. I remember having a home-made <i>pack</i> in Auckland in 1933.
