Quote: The day before the following weekend I was locked up in the pound. A pound is for locking up animals. If only we'd been animals the RSPCA and all the animal lovers would have caused a public outcry - but we were only humans so no one worried. There had been no reason for punishing me - the official reason given was that I was put there as an assistant cleaner. The cleaner already there had virtually nothing to do. So the whole deal was hell of an unusual - in fact no crim I met had ever before heard of a situation in which an inmate who'd committed no offence had been sent to the pound - especially as an assistant cleaner.

Quote: The tale about being in the "pound" is told and retold; the rebel has returned to the fold with stature increased. What isn't mentioned is the torturous difficulty the "hero" had in making it throught a few days on his own.
