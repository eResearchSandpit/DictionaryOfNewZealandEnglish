Quote: The story of the Taranaki village of Parihaka and its two visionary leaders, Te Whiti o Rongomai and Toku Kaka, whose campaign of passive resistance culminated in 1881 in the invasion and destruction of Parihaka by 1500 militia, has been a lightning rod for cultural and political energy in this country... The exhibition brings together for the first time the wealth of artwork inspired by Parihaka.

Quote: As the author rightly says in his preface, Parihaka has achieved an "almost mythic status in our national consciousness"... Even his defiantly impartial hero, reading about Parihaka, is reminded of "what he had seen and experienced as a child and a youth in Ireland; the dawn horror of eviction; red skies and the smell of burning hovels; lamentations and anger; riots and his father dead on the waterlogged road."

Quote: Again we gather in this place, here at Parihaka, on the marae of peace, to hear the word of God - we listen, we pray, we sing. <i>Ibid.</i> 37 The rape of Parihaka - a peaceful, and almost unarmed, defenceless village - was to be carried out not by British Imperial Forces but by true New Zealanders, and the invasion plans were hurried up because the Governor was out of the country.

Quote: No one put up a fight - indeed, it was against the rules to have a weapon of war in Parihaka - but the passive gestures had their own power and poetry, as simple and effective as a Vietnam war protestor sliding a flower's stem down the barrel of a gun.

Quote: Scott stumbled onto Parihaka when he was in bed with chickenpox and happened to be reading a British high court law report. "A place called Parihaka was in it, and I couldn't believe it, it was all about libel action."

Quote: One of the things I'd like to see come out of this [exhibition] is the awareness of people generally throughout Aotearoa, their understanding of what Parihaka means, and why it's so significant to the people of Taranaki. Many people really don't know much about Parihaka and its early history, or the implications of Parihaka.

Quote: The passive resistance carried out by Te Whiti and the other brave people in this small Taranaki settlement of Parihaka against the might of the British and settler armies was a major event in colonial history... Hinchcliff's <i>Parihaka</i> brings to life the personalities and events of  the 1880s.
