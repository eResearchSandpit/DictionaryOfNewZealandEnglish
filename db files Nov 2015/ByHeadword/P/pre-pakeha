Quote: Among composite forms in which the adjective appears are <i>pre-pakeha times, Journal of the Polynesian Society,</i> 27 (1918), <i>pre-pakeha days,</i> V. Roberts <i>Kohikohinga</i> (1929), etc. and the jocular uses <i>pakehas</i> (the `has' being accented) and <i>pakehasn't</i>, for a rich and penniless white man respectively. (These uses may have occurred in print, but I have not seen them; only heard them.)
