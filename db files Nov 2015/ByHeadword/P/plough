Quote: While on this subject of cultivation, I am told that the Maoris [on the East Coast] had turn-over ploughs, so that when the end of a furrow was reached, the plough was turned round, the mechanism turned over, and this gave a mould-board on the other side of the plough. I haven't seen any of these implements, so cannot describe one.
