Quote:  <i>Gaultheria antipoda-</i> Forst.f. Common name: <i>Snowberry </i>Maori name: <i>Papapa</i> ... This little shrub is common throughout New Zealand in scrubland. Possibly it is the plant referred to by James Cowan [in Maori Today] ... although Williams identifies `papapa' as both <i>Pomaderris elliptica</i> (Rhamnaceae) and <i>Gaultheria antipoda-</i>.
