Notes: Jim writes: a historical form of penal institution in NZ. The first prison camp was at Milford Sound in the 1890s; subsequently there were <i>tree-planting camps</i> in the North and South Island. See annual reports in AJHR series H-20. Prison camp may be an international term in this sense as well as in relation to war prisoners. NZOD defines it ambiguously as a camp for detaining prisoners of war <i>or of the State</i>.
