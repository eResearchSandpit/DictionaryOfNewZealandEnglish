Quote: Applying for Pub Charity funding is as easy as 1-2-3 .. Forms are available from your local Pub Charity venue, or you can request one in writing from the Pub Charity Head Office (PO Box 27 009, Wellington) or online at www.pubcharity.org.nz ... Pub Charity's committee considers not only the local authority areas the applications come from, but the very townships and communities, to ensure the communities that raise the funds reap the benefits.
Notes: Pub Charity Donation Supplement, a publication that will not be continuing; info will be published by Charitable Trust Assoc and in newspapers.
