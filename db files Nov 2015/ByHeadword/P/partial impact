Quote: Partial Impact explains light, heat, electricity, gravitation, Freethought, Socialism, epidemic diseases, - explainds in short everything in the heavens above, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth, except the unwillingness of the world to receive thte theory itself.

Quote: At the meeting of the members of the Philosophical Institute last evening, Professor Bickerton read a paper "On temporary and variable stars," in which he treated of the partial impact of two large bodies as a possible frequent occurence, and as giving a perfectly satisfactory explanation of temporary and variable stars, of double stars, of all kinds of nebulae, of comets, and indeed of all the varied phenomena of the universe.

Quote: This appears to be the position of Professor Bickerton's theory of Partial Impact, and we should say that he is justified in asserting that, "The fact that astronomers are working without it has already caused irreparable loss to science ..."

Quote: In 1878 Bickerton revealed his partial impact theory of the creation of new stars which formed the basis of his theory of cosmic evolution. The notion that the oblique collision of two stars produces a new, hot, rapidly expanding body without destroying the original two in the process explained virtually all astronomical mysteries for Bickerton, but provoked only indifference or scepticism from scientists.

Quote: Partial impact appears competent to explain the occurrence of temporary, double, and variable stars, nebulae of various kinds (the kind depending on the nature of the impact), comets, and finally stars or suns accompanied by bodies of smaller size.

Quote: The hypothesis I am about to describe suggests that this is the case, but especially says further, that if they do knock against each other that the blow may be a mere graze of the two outside, or sometimes a large piece of each may be struck off, and in extremely rare cases they may meet fair; but as this latter isso extremely rare, the other cases are those chiefly considered, and so the theory is called Partial Impact.

Quote: The hypothesis that I am about to describe suggests that this [collisions] is the case, but especially says further that if they do knock against each other, the blow may be a mere graze of the two outsides, or sometimes a large piece of each other may be struck off: and in extremely rare cases they may meet fair; but as this latter is so extremely rare the other cases are those chiefly considered, and so the theory is called <i>Partial Impact.</i> The effect of the collision of our two stars will be to strike a piece off each other where they touch, and each star will travel on with a slice cut off the side of each. The parts of each which met will be left behind by both the retreating bodies, and will probably remain where the collision occurred. But, owing to the way it has been struck off, the two sides being impelled in opposite directions, it cannot help revolving, and it is not unlikely that nearly all the thousands of rotating bodies and systems in the universe may have thus been set spinning by partial impact. At partial impact, rotation must ensue. The matter will tend to spread out more or less in a flare, with frequently gas at the poles and the middle body produced by the collision will generally be very hot, proportional to the mass.

Quote: It is most singular that this first, this fundamental, this absolutely basic idea of a third body, has for a quarter of a century been missed by astronomers.  They have been bombarded with tens of thousands of papers and pamphlets.  Diagrams showing the third body have been broadcasted before them by thousands and by hundreds.  A new term - "Partial Impact" - was specially coined to express the idea for their benefit and guidance.  But there they sit in their specialized turrets, regardless; and this prime idea, that the parts struck from grazing suns are welded into a third body, has failed to impress them.
