Quote:  ... the Kauri Timber Company employed a man, known as the Company's `pirate', whose job it was to travel the banks of all the waterways in search of logs stranded above high water mark, and, following periodical reports, men were sent to jack the logs into the water and prepare them for towing to the mills.
