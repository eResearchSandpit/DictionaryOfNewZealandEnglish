Quote: [Caption] Sonchus oleraceus, pororua or common puha; S. kirkii, raurorua or NZ native puha. Ibid. The original Maori puha was rauroroa or S. kirkii - a ntive which has a whitish bloom on the leaf surfaces and is usually found near the coast... Puha leaves were put on cuts and wounds to prevent infection, and waipuha, or water in which puha had been boiled, was drunk to cure stomach complains and loss of appetite.
