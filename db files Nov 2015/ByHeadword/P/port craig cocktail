Notes: Excerpt from Wise: PORT CRAIG Remote locality on the western shoreline of Te Waewae Bay, on the Foveaux Strait coast of Wallace County, South Island... Crayfishing. Once the port for sawmilling settlement with a large timbermill but the site was abandoned when the venture folded in the financial depression of the 1930s. Named after mill hand John Craig, one of two men drowned at the mouth of the nearby Waikoua River. Reed's Place Names says: Well known at one time as having the largest timbermill in NZ. This was established by the Marlborough Timber Company. A recent pamphlet by Bremer gives a good account of the mill in 1927 but does not mention cocktails.
