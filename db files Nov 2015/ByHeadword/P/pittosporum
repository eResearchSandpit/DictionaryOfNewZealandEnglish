Quote: <i>Pit&#769;.tos&#769;.po-rum</i> (p&ibreve.t-t&obreve.s&#769;.po.-r&ubreve.m),<i> n</i>. [NL., fr. Gr. {pitta} pitch + {sporos} seed.] (Bot.) A genus of trees and shrubs, the type of the order <i>Pittosporeae. </i>The seeds, imbedded in a black gluten (whence the name) are contained in berries, which grow in clusters and are indehiscent. Of 55 species 9 are found in Australia and 6 in New Zealand. The scientific term is used as the vernacular name; but various species are also known by other names. Thus <i>Pittosporum undulatum </i>is called <i>native laurel</i> or <i>mock orange; P. tenuifolium, black mapou; P. eugenoides, tarata</i> or <i>white mapou; P. phillyraeoides, poison berry tree, butter bush, willow</i>, and <i>native willow</i>. See under LAUREL, MAPOU, POISON, and TARATA.
