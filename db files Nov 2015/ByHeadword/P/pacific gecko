Quote: The Pacific gecko is nocturnal and feeds on vegetation or on insects, grubs and berries. By day they hide in cracks in clay banks, under stones or in cracks in tree trunks. Sometimes they are seen basking in the sun. Their colour and patterning are variable and they bear their young in the late summer.
