Quote: This is one of the reasons that informal social control mechanisms at Paremoremo are so strong.

At Paremoremo you have to learn quickly to conform to criminal norms or live the life of a pariah. <i>Ibid.</i> 130 A lot of my old mates ... disapproved totally of what was happening and put me on the coat. We remained on speaking terms, but it wasn't the same as it had been before. . <i>Ibid.</i> 246 Coat (n) Put on the Coat. Ostracise, excommunicate.
