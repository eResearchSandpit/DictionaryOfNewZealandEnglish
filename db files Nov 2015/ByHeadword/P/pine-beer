Quote:  From the leaves of the rimu Cook brewed `spruce beer', and the black-pine [matai] furnishes a beverage known to bushmen as `pine-beer'. The tree containing beer may usually be known by a black, smutty-looking stain that extends some way up the trunk; and if a hole be bored at the base the tree may be plugged and tapped like a barrel.
