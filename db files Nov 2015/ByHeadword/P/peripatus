Quote: "We would find wetas and peripatus. Do you know peripatus?... It's a very pretty creature with a crushed velvet body, greyish green - its whole body undulates beautifully - it's the missing link between the worms and the anthropods [sic] like crayfish or woodlice. It's segmented but each segment has a pair of small stumpy legs with two tiny claws."

Quote: It is most commonly called peripatus - from the same Greek root as <i>peripatetic</i>, meaning itinerant or wandering... The animal is also called the velvet worm or walking worm - references to two of its more obvious traits. Peripatus are found largely in the southern hemisphere - in Australasia, south-east Asia, Africa and Central and South America. <i>Ibid.</i> 66 I have to roll my peripatus onto its back again to view the circular, lobe-lipped mouth with double pair of sickle-shaped mandibles, and the two lumpy "gun turrets" - oral papillae - used to such effect in the capture and consumption of prey. Both the jaws and oral papillae, as well as the antennae, are pairs of modified limbs. Peripatus are opportunistic and will scavenge in preference to expending energy on hunting. <i>Ibid.</i> 74 Peripatus may boast a lineage more ancient than that of New Zealand's other, more famous, "living fossil," the tuatara. Early marine animals, such as this 500-million-year-old fossil from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, appear remarkably similar to living onycophorans... <i>P. novaezealandiae</i> females.. have been found to carry embryos at all stages of development at all times of year, and to give birth regardless of the season, albiet more abundantly in summer.
