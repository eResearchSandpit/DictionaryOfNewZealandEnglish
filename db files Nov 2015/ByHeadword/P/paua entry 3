Quote: He has turned the idea around by using a modern medium - stainless steel - to create wall reliefs with slots cut to reveal a glimpse of laminated sheets of paua behind...

Only a teaspoon of minced paua goes into each ravioli.. which is served with a beurre blanc and shoe-string frites of kumara.
