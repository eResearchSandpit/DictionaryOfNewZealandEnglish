Quote: Council staff sprang into action yesterday morning when more than 250 puffer fish were found scattered over two kilometres between Karaka Bay and Fort Dorset... National Institute of Water and Atmosphere spokesman Malcolm Francis said quick action was necessary as the fish were extremely toxic... Puffer fish were common in New Zealand waters, but they rarely washed up on the beaches.
