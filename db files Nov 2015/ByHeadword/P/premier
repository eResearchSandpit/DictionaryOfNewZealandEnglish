Quote: In the constitutional debates of 1854 during the first session of the New Zealand Parliament, the term `Prime Minister' was frequently used in a somewhat casual fashion. This explains in part why it was some years before the term `Premier' came into general usage. William Fox (q.v.) who took office in July 1861, was described in the <i>Gazette</i> as Attorney-General `with first seat in the Ministry'. In November 1864 Weld (q.v.) was gazetted as holding `a seat in the Executive Council and the office of Premier'. Stafford (q.v.) his successor, in October 1865 was termed `First Minister'. In June 1869, when Fox again headed a Ministry, he was described officially as `Premier and member of the Executive Council.' Thereafter the term `Premier' was regularly used. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the Leader of the Government `being the Prime Minister'. The first Premier to use the title `Prime Minister' officially was Richard John Seddon (q.v.). It was used in the <i>New Zealand Year Book</i> of 1900 and the Imperial Conference of 1903 confirmed the practice.
