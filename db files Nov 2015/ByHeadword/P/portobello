Quote: After growers have played with several names, including the ugly "brown flats", the unappetising "BBQ flats" and the inaccurate "field mushrooms", they have settled on "Portabello", which is already well known in the US and Europe. "Swiss Browns", another name used overseas, is the new names for brown buttons.
