Quote: "In the early 20th century Plunket served a real function for women, for whom paid employment outside of the home was not an acceptable option. It got middle class married women out of the home and into the public sphere where they could contribute meaningfully and it no longer serves that function"... Now women no longer have to channel their energies into voluntary organisations, such as Plunket to find a niche in the public world. <i>Ibid.</i> C7 She began with the view which arose out of 1970s feminism, that Plunket had been a foce that dictated to women and kept them in their place.

Quote: A Plunket Nurse sent to the settlement would be reduced to the gibbers in a week. ... the nearest I got the Maori mothers to `Plunket feeding' was in administering the babies' food out of a bottle instead of with a spoon.
