Quote: Keith Snalam of Blenheim writes: "As an apprentice boy in the 50s, I frequently heard the term 'pannikin boss'. I'm sure it was used as a comment on the state of mind of the foreman or leading hand, that person having just had the big boss from the office on his hammer ... The foreman would be seen approaching the workers in a state which these days would be described as stressed out. Hence the term, 'here comes the panickin' boss'!"  Maybe. Dave Bijoux of Mt Eden suggests: "The pannikin boss drank from the pannikin, as did all the workers: a boss who metaphorically drank from their cup, was part of the community, and was somewhat despised as a prostitute for the workers. Ronald Thomas of Pamlerston North adds: "Perhaps there is a connection between a metal cup that holds a little liquid and a trumped-up boss who holds little authority, but makes a lot of noise about it."
