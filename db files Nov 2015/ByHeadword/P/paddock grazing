Quote: More recently, howver, the heavy labour requirement of this practice [block grazing] has been superseded by a modified system called paddock grazing. This is where up to 5 days pasture feed will be allocated in one hit (often meaning one complete paddock) with any hay or silage allocated usually being fed out in progressively larger amounts in the last 2-3 days. In minimising stress the paddock grazing was clearly superior.
