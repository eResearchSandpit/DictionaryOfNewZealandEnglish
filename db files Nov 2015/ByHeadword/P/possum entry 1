Quote: <i>possum</i>-The Australian marsupial introduced in the early days (in 1858, 1870, 1895) as a means of fostering a fur trade, but now one of New Zealand's greatest pests. Not to be confused with the American opposum which is carnivorous, the Australian possum is vegetarian.

Quote:  `I believe that the member for Tarawera is referring to the possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), not opossums (genus Didelphis) which are American marsupials,' [Agriculture Minister Moyle] said in his written reply. ... And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum. The Aussie possum - there are about six types across the Tasman - looked so much like the American counterpart when first discovered by Europeans that it was called an opossum. As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ... The fur trade is pushing for `NZ phalanger' (a generic name for a group of marsupials) while possum stew exporters are trying to win acceptance for `Kiwi bear' in Oriental restaurants.
