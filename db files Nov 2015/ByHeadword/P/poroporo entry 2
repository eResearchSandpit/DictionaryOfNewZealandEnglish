Quote: PIRI PIRI (<i>Aceara ... sanguisorbae</i>). This name is commonly corrupted into [called] bidi bid. In the North Island the plant is called hutiwai or utiwai and by mistake poroporo. It is a native species well known to all New Zealanders, and is a weed chiefly on land in process of being brought into occupation.
