Quote: In this case the damage is serious; all other stains which have come under Waters' notice merely affect the use of the wool for undyed goods, the tensile strength of the fibres being apparently normal, but in the case of so-called `Pink Rot' the fibres are reduced to their component cells or retted and are quite useless. <i>Ibid.</i> 815 `Pink-Rot of Wool,' <i>N.Z. Jnl. Agric</i>., Vol. xliv, p. 35, 1932.
