Quote: In the bays and tidal rivers are the mango or sharks - the most highly-prized food-fish - the tamure or schnapper, the whapuka or rock-cod, the kahawai or mackerel, the porahi or herring, the kanae or mullet, the patiki or sole, and many others. On the shores are oysters, mussels, cockles, mutton-fish, crabs, and other shell-fish in profuse abundance. In the fresh-water creeks are eels (tuna), lampreys (pipiharau), and whitebait (inanga). <i>Ibid.</i> 2/231 We prefer the substantial schnapper, the goodly whapuka or kanae, or the luscious poraki.
