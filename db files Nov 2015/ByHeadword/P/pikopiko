Quote: Among the kawakawa, koromiko, puha and horopito inhabiting wild menus is the peppery premature ponga frond pikopiko .. It turned up in a dish created by Ohio-born, Colorado-trained chef who was asked how he'd come across such an obscure indigenous ingredient when menus he'd been used to creating were more likely to feature T-bones, sassafras and sarsparilla. "Oh, we have 'em over there," he said, "cept they're called 'fern shoots.'"
