Quote: A few trees were left standing about the tents for shade, but since the felling had been finished to some distance from the camps, I have advised the men to build for themselves rough punga huts, not that I thought they were in any danger where they were, but that I thought they would be more comfortable, and be nearer their work if they made huts further up the road.
