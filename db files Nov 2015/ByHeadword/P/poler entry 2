Quote: On Monday last, at 6 o'clock, Cobb's coach ... left Dunedin for Dunstan all right, but ater running twenty miles, one of the fore wheels collapsed. ... Upon [the driver's] arrival at the Union Hotel with his polers, he was rushed with enquiries. ...Seating himself on the axle in a comical position, he was `Joe'd' by a chorus of lookers-on. Replying that those who had nothing better to do than `Joe' him were a set of `tarnation fools', he drove off at top speed.
