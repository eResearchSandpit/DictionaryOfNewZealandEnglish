Quote:  There are great plenty of a kind of birds much resembling our black birds, except they have a few white feathers in the wings and tail and some fine loose downy feathers round the neck which grow out among the black ones & has the appearance of fine white hairs intermixed with the feathers & under the throat are 4 fine curling white feathers growing in a tuff. These are called Poey-birds. They are thought to be the finest eating for delicacy & richness ... <i>Ibid.</i>  2/213 During our ramble [in Queen Charlotte's Sound] I saw Wood Pigeons, Parroquets, Grey Parrots, Poey Birds & Quails & vast variety of singing Birds but no animal great or small or any fruit Trees of any kind whatever.

Quote: Amongst the small birds I must not omit to particularise the wattle- bird, poy-bird .... The poy-bird is less than the wattle-bird .... Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled snow-white feathers, called its poies, which being the Otaheitean word for ear-rings occasioned our giving that name to the bird ... [Morris note: In the illustration given it is spelt <i>poe-bird</i>, and in the list of plates it is spelt <i>poi</i>]

This bird was brought to us for sale by the natives, in small cages made of wicker-work.

Quote: `This bird they called the Wattle-bird, and also the Poy-bird, from its having little tufts of curled hair under its throat, which they called poies, from the Otaheitan word for ear-rings. The sweetness of this bird's note they described as extraordinary, and that its flesh was delicious, but that it was a shame to kill it.'

Quote: The most remarkable bird is one to which Cook's people gave the name of mocking-bird, from the extraordinary variety of its notes. There is also another which is called by the English the poe, or poi bird, from a little tuft of white curled feathers which it has under its throat, and which seemed to them to resemble certain white flowers worn as ornaments by the people of otaheite, and known there [188] by a similar name.
