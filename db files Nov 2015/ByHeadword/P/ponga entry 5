Quote: Then there were the magnificent tree-ferns, one kind growing some forty feet high, called punga by the natives; another sort ... they call mamaku; and yet another giant fern, the pura ... [with] a bulbous-looking root, like Brobdingnagian dahlias.

Quote: [Corresp. col.] Sir, - It is to be regretted that the artist who labelled his picture `Punga with Parasites,' did not write `Tree fern with Parasites,' as punga does not mean tree fern, or anything like it. Bushmen usually called a pukatea, buckyteer; a kowhai, goey; and a kaponga, [variant of ponga] a bunger whence comes the word punga, both a noun and a verb in Maori. The kaponga or brown tree fern is not nearly so handsome as the mamaku, or black tree fern [Cyathea medullaris], the latter often being a chief's prerogative for the white heart in the middle of the young leaves, which was baked and eaten.
