Quote: Many expected to see a little bit of fun here, but with the exception of a very mild prop and pig-jump they were disappointed, and in half-an-hour's time he was almost entirely under words of command, such as "stop," "walk," "trot," c., and the tamer was soon able to mount the seat behind the horse and drive him pretty well at pleasure.
