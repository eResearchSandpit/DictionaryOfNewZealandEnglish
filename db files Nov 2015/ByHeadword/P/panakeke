Quote: The Maori word for bread is paraoa which is a trans-literation of the word flour. Various kinds of bread were made by the whalers, traders, and missionaries and some of them survive today and are regarded by present-day Maoris as non-Pakeha items of diet. One of these is called rewena (leaven) bread, another is the panakeke, or pancake-type bread.
