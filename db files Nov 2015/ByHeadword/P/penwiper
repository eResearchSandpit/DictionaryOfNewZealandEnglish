Quote: <i>NOTOTHLASPI ROSULATUM.</i> The penwiper plant, like <i>Ranunculus haastii,</i> grows on South Island scree slopes ... The leaves form a neat circular rosette, ... in appearance much like the now forgotten penwipers made of overlapping strips of soft cloth on which Edwardian writers wiped the ink off their steel-nibbed pens.

Quote: ... everywhere I walked I found a dozen penwiper plants. This lovely little rosette grows in deep, cool shingle ...where its long roots ...feed the huge flower head which rises and scents the air as strongly as carnation or gardenia.

Quote: The best known scree species is the penwiper plant (<i>Notothlaspi rosulatum</i>) ... which belongs to the cabbage family (Cruciferae). Its rosettes of grey, fleshy leaves closely overlap in a dome-like arrangement, which reminded early settlers of the similarly arranged and sewn together diamonds of felt on which they wiped their quill pens.

Quote: Unlikely as it may seem, many fascinating plants, including the distinctive penwiper, <i>Notothlaspi rosulatum</i>, not only survive but flourish amid the shifting screes and windswept gullies far above the treeline. Ibid. 42 One scree specialist found in eatern parts of the Southern Alps from Marlborough to Canterbury, the attractive penwiper (<i>Notothlaspi rosulatum</i>), grows in a rosette of grey leaves which blend perfectly with their surroundings.

Quote: The slide is too recent to be weathered, but on its edge there is a small patch of penwiper plant, shy  and bulging with an unflowered stem that will in a few weeks open with a honey-scented head of white flowers.

Quote: The strange-looking Notothlaspi rosulatum, or penwiper, grows in scree and got its name because it reminded early botanists of the felt wipers they used to wipe their quill pens.
