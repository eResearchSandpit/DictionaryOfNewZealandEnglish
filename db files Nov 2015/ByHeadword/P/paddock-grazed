Quote: The paddock grazed herd got the whole paddock for the whole 5 days, but received their supplementary silage only on days 3,4 and 5. It was suggested that the main reason for this lowered pasture production on the paddock grazed area was cows actually grazing regrowth pasture - they were in fact often observed to do this in days 4 and 5.
