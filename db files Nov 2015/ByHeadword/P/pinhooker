Notes: US usage in OED : 1944 Richmond (Virginia) Times-Despatch 5 Oct. 18 The fixation of prices this year is bad business for the time-honoured 'pinhooker', the man with relatively small operating capital who, during the more spacious days of tobacco selling when the auctioneer got the green light for a sale from wall to wall, bought tobacco when the market was low and held it until it was high, pocketing the difference. The prices this year are so narrow that the pinhooker's business has been practically squeezed out.] WEBSTER : pinhooker  - a small speculator in tobacco at a local market

Quote: Aynsley admits that it might seem strange for someone who never bets at the races to risk tens of thousands of dollars on the pinhooking game, one of racing's biggest gambles... It also failed to clear the most tricky hurdle facing pinhookers - trying to pick the sire which will be fashionable in six months' time.
