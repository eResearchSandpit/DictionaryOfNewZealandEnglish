Quote: A lot of plants that do well in a subtropical garden are better appreciated overseas: "the pseudopanax, five finger, is a huge seller overseas"... You can use pseudopanax, <i>Griselinia littoralis, Griselinia lucida</i> (puka), nikau, tree ferns and cabbage trees very effectively for a lush, verdant look.
