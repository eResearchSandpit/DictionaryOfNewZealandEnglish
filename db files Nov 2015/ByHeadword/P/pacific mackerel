Quote: <i>Blue mackerel Scomber autralasicus</i> ... An Indo-Pacific species ... Often simply called mackerel, from its close similarity to the common mackerel  (<i>Scomber scomber</i>) of the Northern Hemisphere ... In New Zealand it has often been called English mackerel and Pacific mackerel, but it is becoming more widely and appropriately known now as blue mackerel.
