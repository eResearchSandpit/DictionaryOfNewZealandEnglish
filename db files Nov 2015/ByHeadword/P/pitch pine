Quote: Capt. Cook has given so good a description of the Spruce Fire, that it is impossible to mistake it. But he has not taken any notice of the Pitch Pine - Birch - And large Myrtle. The Pitch Pine is remarkable for its black bark, which when cut and rubbed with the finger smells agreeably. It generally grows from 20 to 40 feet without branches, and the wood is much like Norway Pitch Pine, but whiter.
