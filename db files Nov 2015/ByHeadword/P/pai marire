Quote:  ... We met a small party of [440] mounted natives, who brought news that an apostle of the new <i>Pai Marire,</i> or <i>Te Hau,</i> fanaticism had arrived at Taupo ... They are called <i>Pai Marire</i>, from the words which they subscribe to their signatures and use in greeting or parting from their co-religionists. The words literally mean `good! be appeased'; but the real tendency of the belief is to unite the Kingites of all sects in one common bond of fanatical hostility to the pakehas. <i>Te Hau </i>means only the <i>hau </i>(faith). <i>Ibid</i> 466 ... a host of perverts were chanting <i>Pai Marire </i>hymns round a <i>Hau-hau</i> post of worship, erected close to the late Christian church.

Quote: <i>Pai Marire </i>- `The Good and Peaceful', also known as `Hauhauism' - was a syncretic religion originated by the prophet Te Ua Haumene, of the Taranaki tribe, in 1862. It had messianic and millenarian aspects, and theologically combined traditional Maori religion and the Maori versions of Christianity with Te Ua's own innovations. ... The original form of Pai Marire may have died out as early as 1866, with the death of its founder, but related or similar cults developed around leaders such as Hakaraia, Te Whiti O Rongomai, Titokowaru, Te Kooti, and Tawhiao himself.
