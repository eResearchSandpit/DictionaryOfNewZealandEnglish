Quote: The pod is a hydrodynamically designed handboard which fastens with a velcro strap to the palm of the hand and when used while bodysurfing provides propulsion, lift and control... The pod.. is not new, just refined. It has been around for a while now, with the Taylor's Mistake handboard being popular among surf lifesavers in New Zealand as far back as the 1970s.
