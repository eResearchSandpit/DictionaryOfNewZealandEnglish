Quote: Protestant natives regard their Roman Catholic brethren as belonging to the devils: they are called pikipo, which M. Pompalier explained as being derived from <i>episcopus</i>, which seems to me the most probable derivation. The Protestant missionaries however, say that it means piki-po - always bowing [370] - (piki, bend - po, night). The Protestants, therefore, call their bishop pihopa, while the Roman Catholics have retained the title pikipo for theirs.

Quote: They took the name of Pikopo. This no doubt was maorified from the Latin word <i>episcopos</i>; but, unfortunately for them, it had the ominous meaning in the Maori tongue, - <i>creeping in the dark.</i>

Quote: Even their name [sc Roman Catholics] may have hindered their progress. They were called Pikopo; the Maori attempt to reproduce the word <i>episcopos</i>. Unhappily for them, the word also means `creeping in the dark' : an idea which would not be helpful.

Quote: In his discussions with the Maoris, Bishop Pompallier had stresed the point that he held the advantage over the Protestant missionaries in that he was a member of the Episcopacy. The best attempt on the part of the natives to render into their own language the word Episcopos, in its varied forms, was <i>pikopo</i>, hence the Bishop and his converts became known as <i>Pikopo</i>.
