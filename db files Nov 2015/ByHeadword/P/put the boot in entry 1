Quote: <i>boot</i>: can be used for the things you hike in, and there is an expression `to put the boot in' which means metaphorically to kick someone, as `then he really put the boot in and sent him down the road' (fired him); or gave him the boot. How ever, the commonest use of boot refers to what you would call the TRUNK of your car.
