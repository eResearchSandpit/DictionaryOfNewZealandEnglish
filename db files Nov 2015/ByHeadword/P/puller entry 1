Quote: The [central North Island] hunters have what they call `pullers'; these are simply big strong horses and as the captured animal recovers from the tranquiliser it is tied to this horse's tail. ...as long as the hunters position themselves so that the captured horse pulls straight back this has little effect on the puller's tail.
