Quote: Some of the lads made their [sun-dried] bricks in what they called a pug ring, formed by driving the horses round in a circle as with the old-time chaffcutter, but Cecil made his on what they called a straight. A strip of ground about 30 yards long by four or five wide was scooped free of top soil, which was dumped on the garden nearby. It was then ploughed about ten inches deep, or according to the number of bricks required, and very well watered, which was usually done with a shovel from a tank on a sledge for even distribution, and left to soak all night. A good layer of chopped-up tussocks was then evenly spread over the top. After more watering a six-horse team was driven up and down the strip until the pug was well mixed.
