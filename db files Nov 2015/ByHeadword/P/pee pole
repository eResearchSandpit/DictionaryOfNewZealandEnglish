Quote: Using a contraption called a female urinary director, it is "slipped into your salopettes", covers the necessary area and a tube extension directs the urine where it needs to go. These "toilets" are called pee poles as they consist of a yellow flag on top of a pole. Identifying these areas is important as the snow is also used for drinking water.
