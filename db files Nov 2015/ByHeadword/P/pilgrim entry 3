Quote: [1851 Apr 19 Lyttelton Times `Government might have founded a colony composed of stragglers from other settlements, of whale-fishers and stock-drivers, but would they have persuaded a body of English gentlemen to transfer their homes to these shores?' The following was written in reply:] `Dream of Shagroon' [title] I saw men of another aspect arrive at the pilgrim-land. ... The Pilgrims looked with contemptuous eye on this people of strange aspect and impure blood, and did despise them. ... I awoke - and lo! the land which was to have been sacred to the orthodox foot only of a `body of English gentlemen', was in possession of the `stragglers, the whalers, and the stock-drivers from other settlements'. Alas! for the goodly land, - the land of the Canterbury Pilgrims.

Quote: ... it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, a Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.

The Australian squatters were dubbed `Shagroons', a term the origin of which appears to be somewhat elusive. [Quotes Webster and Funk and Wagnall: both definitions erroneous]
