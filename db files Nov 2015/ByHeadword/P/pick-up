Quote: The whistle indicated that a rider had ridden the specified time. If he was still aboard, the pick-up man came forward on his quick, obedient horse and plucked him expertly from his turbulent mount. A rider could find himself down across the saddle...or with back hard against the shoulder of the pick-up's horse.
