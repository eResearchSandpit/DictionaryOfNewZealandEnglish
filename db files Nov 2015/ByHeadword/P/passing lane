Notes: Jim Cameron writes: British dictionaries (including OED) have <i>crawler lane</i>, which I have seen in NZ (there was one so called on the Bombay Hill highway) and <i>fast lane</i>, current literally and metaphorically here, but not <i>passing lane</i>. (British road atlases use the term <i>passing place</i>. For a time recently there were <i>passing bays</i> on the Rimutaka Hill road). The corresponding Australian term, at least in Victoria, is <i>overtaking lane</i> (Personal observation).
