Quote: When the first settlers came to New Zealand, they didn't bring many ploughs with them from their home countries. ... One of the first of [the New Zealand made ploughs] was a long sleekjob known as a swing plough. ...  The next development was the lever plough which ran on three wheels and had no handles except a stubby one at the back.
