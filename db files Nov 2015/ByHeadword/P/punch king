Quote: Punch King was similar to Bar the Door, but more violent. The game was called Punch King Sinio. ... Five were left uncrowned. ... The five had their backs to the wall, and woe betide any luckless mite who dared to come within reach of their punches, so indiscriminantly were they delivered. Any punch was legal, rabbit or otherwise. ... (1876; Wellington)
