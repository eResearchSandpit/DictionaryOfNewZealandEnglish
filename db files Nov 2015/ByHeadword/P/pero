Quote:  The dog, according to a tradition still existing among the natives, was bestowed on the island, at a very remote period, by a number of divinities, who made a friendly descent on its shores. The name of a dog formerly was <i>pero</i>, which countenances the supposition that the country had been visited by Juan Fernandez, <i>pero</i> in the Spanish language, signifying a dog.
