Quote: Herries Beattie describes a different method: "This tussock was placed in the paraerae (sandal) and the foot inserted. Then the tussock was brought up the leg and tied above the ankle. This protection was called puru and the sandals were then known as tupuru." Patiti was also regarded as "a fine thing to put in the paraerae to keep the feet warm and if one was wading it was warmer with patiti around the feet than without it."
