Quote: <i>pa</i>-Loosely, a Maori village. Properly speaking, a pa was a fortified village; a kaianga was an everyday settlement. In time of war, the populace moved from the kainga to the shelter of the pa. When Tamu spoke of the newcomers in Chapter 14 as `Real pa Maori, eh?' his meaning was, `These are not civilised Maoris; they're real bush Maoris.'
