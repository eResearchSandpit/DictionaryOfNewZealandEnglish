Quote: Shorty after the first sale of land in the township, where sod and thatch whares were beginning to spring up, an old woman, a recent arrival, gravely asked a passer-by to tell her how long it would be before the township was as large as "Port Nick," at which he laughed aloud; but if things go on improving as they have done for the next few years, the old woman's question may not appear so ridiculous after all.

Quote: "The deplorable state of Port Nick is now driving the rag merchants out of that melancholy city with their swags on their backs, and one lucky one has had the good fortune to find out poor insignificant Blenheim - a place unknown to Wellington in its palmy days, but soon found out when wanting a helping hand to lift it out of the mire into which it has sunk."
