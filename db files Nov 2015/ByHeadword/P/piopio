Quote: ... we never saw or heard the notes of either the Piopio, the Tieke, or the Hihi, all of which birds were at one time more numerous even than the Huia. The Zosterops was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.

Quote: <i> piopio</i>, a bush-bird (Turnagra tanagara), the North Island thrush and (T. capensis) the South Island form: both extinct soon after 1900. A riverbed bird, the dotterel, and a naroow-leaved plant, dianella, also bear this name, but the thrush is usually associated with the name: in any case the dianella has a name tuurutu.

Quote: In the strictest sense of the term, New Zealand is without `song-birds'; but such species as the Tui, the Korimako, and the Piopio possess vocal powers of a very respectable kind, the compass and variety of their notes adding greatly to the charm of the New-Zealand woods.
