Quote: It comes as a shock to realise that this all-Australian dessert was in fact first given its name in New Zealand. The great ballerina, Anna Pavlova, toured Australia and NZ in 1926, providing the occasion for the creation of this new dish. "Light as meringue, light as whipped cream", you can hear the chef saying. The first citation is from NZ, in a 1927 booklet put out by Davis Gelatine called <i>Davis Dainty Dishes</i>.

Quote: 43. A delicious party sweet - a New Zealand specialty is called Pavlova. I understand the name was given to it when the famous dancer came to New Zealand with a company many years ago. Apparently she tasted the sweet and was so delighted with it that she gave it her own name.

Quote: As far as we've picked up over the years the pavlova was invented either in Australia or New Zealand, and named as a tributed to Pavlova the dancer. But when or exactly where, we don't know.

Quote: Pavlova is more than a national dish, it is an institution. ... Sweet, airy and laden with calories, the cake was named after Anna Pavlova who visited New Zealand in 1926. ... It is worth mentioning here that the Australians claim to have invented the pavlova, and insist that it was created in honour of Pavlova by a Melbourne woman in 1926. New Zealanders, however, might answer that in the same year a pavlova recipe appeared in a book entitled <i>Home Cookery for New Zealand </i>(although it went under the name of `Meringue with Fruit Filling') and that another recipe actually called `Pavlova' was published the following year. Certainly the classic kiwkfruit (Chinese gooseberry) topping which the Australians have also adopted must belong to New Zealand.

Quote: I would to point out that both the Irish version and the Australian recipe are for a -->meringue cake (sugar and egg whites) and not for the traditional New Zealand pavlova which has a -->soft centre, because of the inclusion of vinegar and cornflour in the N.Z. recipe. I don't think we'll ever discover who had the original idea which transformed a hard oversweet dessert into the delicious dessert of today. I was at University in Dunedin from 1928 to 1932, and well remember my mother making pavlova during the summer holidays - the latest popular recipe from a fellow-member of the local Croquet Club - probably 1928-1929. I remember how carefully she watched over the oven and then turned it onto a plate - almost holding her breath.
