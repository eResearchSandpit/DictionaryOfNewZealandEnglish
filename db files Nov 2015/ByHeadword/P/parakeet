Quote: Within the last three years all these birds, and the morepork as well (I said "all," that is a mistake, as I did not see or hear the parrakeet, that I have not seen for years), I have seen in the thick part of the bush on the side of Mount Cargill.

Quote: ... to say nothing of Korimako and Pitoitoi ..., we never saw or heard the notes of either the Piopio, the Tieke, or the Hihi, all of which birds were at one time more numerous even than the Huia. The <i>Zosterops</i> was everywhere abundant, also the Grey Warbler and Rifleman, and ... we found the Tomtit comparatively plentiful; the Parakeet chased its mate through the tree-tops with sharp cries of `twenty-eight'; ... and among the tangle of the underwood the ever-present Flycatcher displayed its pretty fan-like tail.
