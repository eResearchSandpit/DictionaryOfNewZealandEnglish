Quote: Corned beef and a frenetic game involving up to 200 a side, both curious legacies of the colonisation of the South Seas, are about to make the big time together. The game is krikiti, kirikiti or kilikiti which arrived in the Pacific well over a century ago in the more sedate form of English cricket. Now a couple of Aucklanders have taken the game that's more a social event than a sport, given it some formal rules, and come up with [dollars]100,000 to remould it under the new name of `Pacific Cricket'.
