Quote: In most lowland forest areas of New Zealand spring is heralded by the flowering of the climber now called clematis paniculata but formerly known as clematis indivisa... In his original drawing Mr Fuller showed the Maori name of the flower as "puawananga''. The Botany Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research advised that it should be shown as "pikiarero".
