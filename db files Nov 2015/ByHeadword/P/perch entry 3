Quote: The use of perch as a square measure in New Zealand - one fortieth of a rood - may be noted.   NSOD gives this as 'rare, except historical'.   It became historical here only in 1968 with the advent of metrication, and was until then anything but rare. The area of every piece of land that could not be expressed simply in acres or roods was described in perches. The word occurred in thousands of land titles, and was used to define the size of any section smaller than the quarter-acre 'norm'. Perch as a linear measure on the other hand (as in NZPOD) I have never seen outside the backs of school exercise books!
