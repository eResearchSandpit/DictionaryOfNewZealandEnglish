Notes: the few early (pre-1900) recorded uses suggest that it is a re-anglicisation of Maori <i>poaka</i>, itself an anglicised version of <i>pork(er)</i>, rather than a direct use of OED `young hog fattened for pork', etc (1657) - as elsewhere in NZ English (cf <i>baconer</i>). Perhaps the first of the following uses are merely whimsical. (cf poaka, porky) [?1838 cit. really poaka]

Quote: It is to be observed that 20 poles of good ground, well cultivated, will yield a greater quantity of vegetables than can be economically used by a labourer, his wife, and three or four children; in which case the overplus must either be sold or employed in fattening a porker and a baconer.

Quote: The Maori word <i>poaka</i>, for pig, was probably given them by the Tahitian interpreter, Tupaea, who was with Captain Cook when he gave the New-Zealanders their first pigs. Had the Englishmen given a word they would probably have said `pig,' not `porker,' and the Maoris would have called the animals<i> piki</i>.

Quote: But Sonny had already gone, charging through the brush, the ti-tree slapping and stinging at his face, his hands on the hocks and his head between the haunches of a Captain Cooker, almost as long as he was, five-foot-five. He'll be a tough porker, this one, Sonny was thinking, but smoke him in manuka and he'll keep the hui going for a day or two.

Quote: He had a hunk of wood in his hand and a pocket knife - the wood to hit it over the head and the pocket-knife to bleed it once it was down. Only it wasn't a 50 pound porker, but a very angry full-grown boar which at that moment left the dogs and came galloping up the hill.
