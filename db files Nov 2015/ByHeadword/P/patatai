Quote: The Patatai (<i>Rallus Philippensis</i>) is a small land-rail, plumaged much like the partridge. <i>Ibid.</i> 225 The Putoto (<i>Ortygometra Tabuensis</i>) is a crake, often confounded by settlers with the patatai. It is a smaller bird altogether, having partridge tints on the back, and a grey breast. It chiefly inhabits raupo swamps.
