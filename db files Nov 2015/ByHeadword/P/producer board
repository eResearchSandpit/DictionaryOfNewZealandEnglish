Quote: The first primary producer boards were set up in the wake of the collapse of the commandeer system (q.v.) following the end of World War I. In the years that followed [the establishment of the meat and Dairy Boards] producer boards were set up to oversee the production and export of fruit, honey, poultry and hops. After the [second world]war producer boards were re-established and extended to include wool, eggs, kauri gum, maize, barley, potatoes, bobby calves, pork, apples, berry and citrus fruits, tobacco, and as recently as 1988, kiwifruit (q.v.).
