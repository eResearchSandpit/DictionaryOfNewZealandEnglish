Quote: Why shouldn't he, the first arrival, have the right to take up his pre-emptive option? ... he made the most of it when he appeared before the Waste land Board on February 11 and 13, 1863. `It was about four months ago,' he told the board ..., `that I realised I would be upset by gold-diggers. As a result I have been forced to apply for my pre-emptive rights sooner than I would otherwise have done.'
