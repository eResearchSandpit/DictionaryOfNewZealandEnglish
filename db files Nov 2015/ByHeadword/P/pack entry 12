Quote: His luggage [on his visit to Malvern] was contained in a simple, much-stained khaki rucksack that looked old enough to have been in his possession when he was a boy before World War 1. He always called it `the pack'; later in the visit it would be used to hold the food, raincoats, and everything else that we took with us on ... walks. <i>Ibid.</i> 204 Our routine was always the same. One of us would shoulder the pack and we would walk for half an hour.
Notes: (G. Sayer: `Jack on Holiday': 1950s) The quot. possibly represents C.S.L.'s personal usage influenced by soldiers' `pack', WWI.
