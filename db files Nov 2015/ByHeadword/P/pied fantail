Quote: <i>pi[i]wakawaka</i>, a bird (Rhipidura flabellifera), pied fantail: the so-called black fantail, which is chocolate-colour (R. fuliginosa) is ti[i]wakawaka. The former is common throughout Newzealand; the latter is common in the South Island but rather rare in the North and is thought to be a mutant of the former. Both names were applied to both birds by the Maori, but for distinction pi[i]wakawaka for the pied and ti[i]wakawaka for the black have been adopted by the Pakeha. The bird is noted for the disaster it caused to Maui in his struggle with the mother of night, Hine-nui-te-po, Death personified.
