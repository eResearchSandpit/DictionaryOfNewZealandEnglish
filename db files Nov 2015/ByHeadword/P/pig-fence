Quote: Strong barbed wire with the barbs closer than usual is generally used for pig fences. Strong wire netting fastened to posts may serve, but the barb fence is the most reliable. About five or six of these wires, placed not more than 5in apart, well stretched and stapled to stout posts, should be sufficient to check the exploring tendencies of any ordinary and reasonable pig.
