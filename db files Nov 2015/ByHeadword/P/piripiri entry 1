Quote: The common <i>Acaena</i> was called by the Maoris Piri-piri, but colonists frequently [usually] corrupt the Maori name, and call the plant Bidi-bidi. As a general rule, the Maori names are more incorrectly pronounced as we go southward from Auckland to Otago. This is largely due to the fact that, in the north, Europeans have been brought into closer contact with the Maoris than in the south. In some few cases, the difference in pronunciation may be due to differences in the Maori dialects. The changes that take place often follow phonetic laws - thus the Maori `p' is softened into the European `b' as above, while `r' is replaced by `l' or `d'. Poro-poro (<i>Solanum aviculare</i>) becomes Bulli-bulli, and Puriri becomes Boradi. This also explains such a form as `Kowdie' pine for Kauri pine. Korari - a flax-stalk - similarly becomes Koradi or even Kaladi [1907 edn ?mistakenly, <i>Kalladi</i>]. `K' is also sometimes altered into `g,' this Kie-kie (<i>Freycinetia Banksii</i>) becomes ghi-ghi. The last vowel in a reduplicated syllable was faintly pronounced in Maori, and often disappears altogether in the European form of the word, <i>e.g.</i>, Poro-poro gives Bulli-bull, and Piri-piri gives Bidi-bid.

Quote: PIRI PIRI (<i>Acaena ... sanguisorbae</i>). This name is commonly corrupted into [called] bidi bid. In the North Island the plant is called hutiwai or utiwai and by mistake poroporo. It is a native species well known to all New Zealanders, and is a weed chiefly on land in process of being brought into occupation.

Quote: Attuned to the geographical region were some particularly troublesome growths, and of these, the hard fern (or ring fern) became a special pest difficult to control and to guard against. ... This hard fern and piripiri were greatly encouraged by set grazing with sheep, ... 	<i>Ibid.</i> 239 He [the pioneer] did not realise the insidious spread of secondary growth and of bracken fern, hard fern, water fern, manuka, and piripiri under the close and continuous nibbling of the turf by sheep.
