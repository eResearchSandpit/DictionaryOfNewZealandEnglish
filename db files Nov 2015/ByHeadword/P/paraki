Quote: Whitebait in pristine condition are beautiful... There are local names for them, too - elephant ears and Don Doolin 'bait (which isn't true whitebait at all), and cucumbers (which are actually smelt, Retropinna retropinna, or paraki).

Quote: <i>Vernacular Name</i>.- Powell [TrNZI 2/84] was the first to point out that two fish were referred to as `smelt' in north Canterbury. These were <i>Galaxias attenuatus</i> and <i>Retropinna retropinna.</i> At present Canterbury residents refer to <i>R. retropinna</i> as `silvery,' on account of the silver line running along the side of the half-grown fish. Maoris refer to this `silvery' as `tikihemi,' and to the adult as `paraki.'

Quote: In some other localities these young [smelt, <i>Retropinna</i>] are called tuarenga. The half-grown fish is termed tikihemi and the adult paraki. Certain races of fish have a broad silvery band running along the side; hence the term `silvery.' It is to be regretted that in Canterbury the term smelt is still used to apply to the minnow, <i>Galaxias attenuatus. </i>
