I got a Man who went & fetched me a Fern-tree with root and all, he called it <i>Ma</i>[macron]<i>a</i>[macron,grave]<i>gu</i>, & as I pointed to a large ferntree near me, with leaves whose underside is white, he shewed me the difference & called the latter <i>Po</i>[grave]<i>nga</i>. This Tree is full of tender pulp, ... and I believe this Fern is nearly related to the <i>Sago</i>-tree, which is likewise a Fern.
