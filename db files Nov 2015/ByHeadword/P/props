Quote: In a Supreme Court case, which came before the late Mr. Justice Chapman, father of Sir Frederick Chapman, a voluble witness was giving evidence, stating that he was having a game of `Props' (a gambling game played with shells) with someone, and Joe Mills said this, and Joe Mills did that, and so forth, pouring out a stream of talk, when His Honour interrupted him ...`Now, first of all - What are Props? And who is Joe Mills?'
