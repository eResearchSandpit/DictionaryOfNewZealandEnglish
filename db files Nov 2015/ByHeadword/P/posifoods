Quote: POSIFoods, described.. as <i>Star Trek</i>-style technology, was launched last month. The name related to a new consumer-food category called "point-of-sale individualised foods".  In much the same way that consumers could have their coffee flavoured in a complex range of strengths, flavours and styles, the POSIFood system could alter the formula of snack foods to suit health needs depending on a person's age, weight or physical condition.
