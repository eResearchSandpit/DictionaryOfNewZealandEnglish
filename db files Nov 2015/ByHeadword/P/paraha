Quote: <i>paraha,</i> a climbing plant (Calystegia sepium), a convolvulus. The far-famed Te Rauparaha took his name from this plant as a reminder that when the body of his father was eaten by his enemies they used the leaf (rau) of this plant as a relish. Another convolvulus (C. soldanella) is pohue.
