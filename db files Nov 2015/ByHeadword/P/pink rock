Quote: A Hamilton seizure of `pink rock' - poor quality heroin - is the first heroin seizure in New Zealand in about nine months. ... The `pink rock', which takes its name from the discolouration [sic] caused by shoddy manufacture, came from Thailand ... The `pink rock' has less than 40 per cent purity. It can also be coloured grey or brown by impurities, and is a number three grade heroin.
