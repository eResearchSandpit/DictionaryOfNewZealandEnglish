Quote: T'other day in a Lambton Quay pub, he, with some friends, was drinking, and the pimp thought he saw the barman `poleing', and reported him to the boss, who subsequently sacked the bar-tender, who informs `Truth' that he did not thieve, and was asked to stop on at his job, but very rightly refused.
