Quote: <i>PISONIA BRUNONIANA.</i> Parapara is a small tree of quick, rather soft growth carrying leaves up to 40cm long, of dark glossy green ... Nodular ridges down the length of the `fruit' ... secrete a glutinous substance ... Most spectacular is the ability of this tarry substance to hold small birds. ... anyone who has seen a waxeye struggling to free itself from amongst a cluster of these fruits can easily understand why parapara has earned the name `bird-catching tree'. ... Where it grows with pukanui (<i>Meryta sinclairii</i>) two of our largest-leaved trees come together.
