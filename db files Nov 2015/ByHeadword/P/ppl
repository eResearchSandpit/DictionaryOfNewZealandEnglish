Quote: Paid Parental Leave (PPL), the baby of Alliance leader Laila Harre, comes into force next month and provided you meet a range of criteria, you could be in the money... Early arrivals won't stop people from claiming PPL, as long as the due date is on or after July 2... If you want to share the baby-caring load, PPL can be transferred to a partner or another caregiver, but in this instance both people must meet the minimum standards.
