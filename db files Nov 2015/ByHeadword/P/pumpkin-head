Quote: `I didn't like him at all. A real pumpkin head.' This is the name Australian colonists of English extraction give to German settlers, on account of their round features. Now that even the natives have learned to despise the miserly Teuton land grabbers, the name pumpkin head is often used by people who speak only pidgin English. [1972 ed. note] `Pumpkin head in English in the original. ... may be a confusion between two Americanisms, `pumpkin head' meaning a stupid person and `square head' or a similar term for a German.
