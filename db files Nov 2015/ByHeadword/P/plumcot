Quote: Unlike plumcots, which is another fruit that sometimes appears on our supermarket shelves and is simply a plum crossed with an apricot, pluots (and apriums) are a high tech fruit. They have been developed through intricate hybridising, requiring several generations of crosses before their final traits were created.
