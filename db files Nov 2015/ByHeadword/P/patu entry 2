Quote: [?18?] [The chiefs] were armed with their patooes (<i>patus</i>). (dagger) The root idea of the word <i>patu</i> is `to strike.' The word is applied by the Maoris to all weapons, and also, with a qualifying adjective, to pounders and beaters of flax, fern-root, etc. The early explorers, e.g. Cook, restricted the term to weapons of the <i>mere</i> type, and, as a generic term for this group of weapons is useful - in fact necessary - the usage, though not strictly a Maori one, has been followed by modern ethnographers.

Quote: The battle then became general. A number of women were in the heat of the action, among whom was Tippahee's old wife, not much less than seventy years of age, and Duaterra's wife bearing in her hand a patoo about seven feet long, made out of the jawbone of a whale. [fn] This weapon, the <i>hoeroa</i>, was made almost invariably of whale bone. All specimens extant are made from the lower jaw of the sperm whale. Both ends are rounded, one end being elaborately carved; there is often, also, some carving about the middle. About five feet in length, it seems to have been used, for the most part, as a missile weapon. - <i>Vide</i> Elsdon Best, <i>The Maori As He Was</i>, p.276 <i>et seq. </i>
