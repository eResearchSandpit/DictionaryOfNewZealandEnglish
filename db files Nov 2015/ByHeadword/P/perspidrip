Quote: The critics will no doubt note that <i>to oozle</i> and <i>to trickle</i>, which denoted much slower modes of locomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington trampers are sometimes afflicted with<i> perspidrip,</i> or describe themselves as<i> jagged. Jagged</i> (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted, no doubt has some relation to the English dialect <i>on the jag</i>, a drunken spree, and the American <i>jagged</i>, tipsy, and also owes something to<i> jiggered. </i>
