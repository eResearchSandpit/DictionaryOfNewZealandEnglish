Quote: My wish is to see a proper use made of all the natural resources, and I would even go so far as for instance to use the pressure of the water, before it is supplied to the ships, or before a street is filled with it, to press wool, or do some other service on the wharf.

Quote: My employment was chiefly in packing the woolbales which is very heavy work. You put from 90 to 120 fleeces in a bail which way [sic] from 300 to 350 lbs. It is hard to press the wool into so small a compass. We sheared some 850 sheep to-day.

Quote:  `Press' and `sweep' are technical terms for necessary operations in the woolshed at shearing time. The former refers to pressing the fleeces into tight-packed bales ... to facilitate the transport of an otherwise bulky commodity. The latter is the process of keeping the floor (the `boards'), on which the sheep are shorn, clear of loose ends of wool, dirt and excrement.

Quote: At the main entrance of the shearing-shed, which is a long building with pens down the centre, and an outlet at each end, stands a wool-press, and behind this are the bins into which the fleeces, after having been classed, are placed preparatory to being pressed.

Quote: 368 9548 sheep shorn, 139 bales pressed. I think sheep and wool will be up to last year; run sheep much better. Ewe and paddock sheep not so good. Lice in wool and [dust from] ploughed ground all through Ewe mob. All the paddock sheeps wool must be scoured.

Quote: The skirtings of the neck and shoulder can be called first pieces, and the britch ends made into second pieces. The `bellies' can be placed in a pack hung on the shearing-board, and when two of these are filled they can be pressed.
