Notes: Jim Cameron writes : This replaced the previous sentence of <i>reformative detention</i> (1910) and <i>declaration as habitual offender</i> and <i>habitual criminal</i> (1906). None of these terms is recorded in DNZE. Its scope has been protean. In its present form (Criminal Justice Act 1985 as amended) it is a sentence of indefinite detention with no fixed maximum that may be imposed on persons aged 21 or more convicted of certain sexual and other serious offences. A sentence under the same name existed in England from 1908 to 1967.

Quote: At  the  other end  of  the  scale  is  the indeterminate   sentence   of   preventive detention.  A sentence of the same name existed  in  Britain  from  1908 to  1967. Introduced in New Zealand in 1954 to replace the sentence of reformative detention (1910) and declaration as an habitual offender and habitual criminal (1906), it remains very much alive here.
