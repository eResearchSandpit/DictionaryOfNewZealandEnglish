Quote:  ... All of the children who left Wainawa Primary School had excellent spelling records. We had to learn six new words every night. If we got them right we got chocolate and if we got one of them wrong she used to slap us so hard it would leave a pinky. It was a harsh but effective way to learn how to spell.'
