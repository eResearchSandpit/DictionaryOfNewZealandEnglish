Quote: <i>Picnic, n.</i> Besides the ordinary meaning of this word, there is a slang Australian use denoting an awkward adventure, an unpleasant experience, a troublesome job. In America the slang `an easy or agreeable thing.' (`Standard.') The Australasian use is an ironical inversion of this. -->1896. Modern: -->`If a man's horse is awkward and gives him trouble, he will say, `I had a picnic with that horse,' and so of any misadventure or disagreeable experience in travelling. So also of a troublesome business or other affair; a nursemaid, for instance, will say, `I had a nice picnic with Miss Nora's hair.'' [Check: omit ?]
