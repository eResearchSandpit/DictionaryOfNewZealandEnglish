Quote: I had to ask what a BAW was. It stood for 'Base Area Wellington', an administrative grouping of the camps and units in that area... BAW comprised the inhabitants of Trentham Camp, Fort Dorset and other miscellaneous ordnance depots and TF units. It was quartered at Trentham, which was a crumbling old man's camp that housed a base workshop and a base supply battalion. It was pogue central.
