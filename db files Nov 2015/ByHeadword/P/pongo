Quote: We strolled up the main <i>strada</i> in the evening ... and the Pongo red-cap stopped us to demand where our hats were. Bloody cheek said Mick, as if we're in their damned Pongo army ... The poor old Pongos in their hairy battle-dress, on skimpy rations and poor pay, the poor old Pongos with their white skins, calling their sergeants sir and saluting right left and centre all over the place. And nattering in incomprehensible dialects and county idiom. <i>Ibid.</i>  95 A real Pongo outlook because he'd only been out a few years when the war came and he went into our army. He didn't belong. He had that Pommie accent and that Pommie outlook. It's in the book he'd say. Do it as per the book. <i>Ibid.</i> 219 `Bloody Reginald. What a name to give a kid. A real sissy Pongo name.' ... `This Pongo business annoys me. You haven't even got it right. Pongo's the naval word for soldiers or marines. Out here they use it as just another form of Pommie.'
