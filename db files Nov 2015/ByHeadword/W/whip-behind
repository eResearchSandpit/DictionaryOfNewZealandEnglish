Quote: The boy upon foot cannot bear to see the boy who is riding.   And so it is with envy of a larger growth.   We are always crying out, "Whip behind," in the miserable hope of seing [sic] some hanger-on, more fortunate than ourselves, knocked off his perch.

Quote: The vehicle had passed Wills Street before the appeal was heard, and the way the boy scattered on the stoppage of the lorry showed that he had received a lesson more lasting than the old-fashioned "whip behind."

Quote: A `whip-behind' was used by children for a swinging ride behind a cart or wagon - perhaps from the driver having to turn around and try to slash them off behind with his whip; perhaps from using the momentum of the cart to get a whip-like release; perhaps from `whipping' (that is, dashing quickly there and away again) in behind the cart for a ride. It was said, e.g.,: `I'll give you a hiding if you whip behind the baker's cart again!' My father remembered this word from when he was a boy in Dunedin in the 1870s to 1880s.

Quote: The coach to Dunedin used to stop at Fagerty's Hotel for watering the horses, which were glad of a spell, and then we got ready to hang on behind. The boys who could not get hold of a strap or something would call out, `Whip behind,' and one ill-natured driver did it, too, as the coach went on. Once one of us tripped, and a heap of boys fell in the wet and mud. Dick and Bob Runciman and my little brother Dick were covered with the slurry from head to foot. We got them cleaned somehow and went on to school. (1868; Green Island, Dunedin)
