Quote:  `In selecting a portion of land for a settlement, it would be advisable to take care that it be as clear as possible of what the natives call the wahhe tabboo (<i>wahi tapu</i>). Wherever a person has breathed his last, or his bones have been laid for a time, there is always a piece of timber set up, if there is no tree already growing, to perpetuate his memory. This wahhe taboo is not suffered to be molested, and is held sacred both by friends and strangers.
