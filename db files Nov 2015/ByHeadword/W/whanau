Quote: The smallest sociological unit is the biological family, which the Maoris termed <i>whanau,</i> derived from whanau, to give birth .. The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expanded family group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors .. The term <i>iwi </i> (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thus related to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the <i>iwi </i> has been termed tribe and the <i>hapu </i> a sub-tribe.

Quote: Mr Puketetapu described it as a good balance of the Maori family (whanau) approach encompassing cultural values, and the opportunity for members of the public to buy shares and become part of a New Zealand venture .. Two types of shares [in the Maori International company] will be available. The `Whanau' or group package shares, resaleable only to the company to ensure it retains control, will be available to Maori groups with a small percentage offered to members of the public.

Quote: Whanau - whanau is family, and whanaungatanga refers to the unifying force which binds families together, and thus the whole tribal group. The worst thing that can happen to a Maori is to be ostracised by his/her family group. Whanau refers to more than the nuclear family - the extended family of Aunts and Uncles have rights and responsibilities over a child - `whaea' can mean mother and aunt.

Quote: Traditionally, the whanau was an extended family which incorporated three generations. At the head of the whanau were the kaumaatua (male elder) and kuia (female elder). Their whanau (offspring) lived with them or nearby. These included their children, adult children and spouses, and their grandchildren. Sometimes aged siblings of the kaumaatua and his wife were also included. This meant that a whanau could number up to 20 or 30 members.

Quote: For those without whanau, the original institution is occasionally replaced by a quasi-whanau of a non-kin support group. In the western districts of Auckland there is a group known as Te Whanau o Waipareira. Now, since Waipareira is a district and not an ancestor, the term is a misnomer. The group is also much larger than the conventional whanau because of its open-ended nature. It is capable of taking in all those who live in the district and wish to belong.
