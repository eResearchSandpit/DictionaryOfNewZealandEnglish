Quote: The mysterious disease that is known as the "Winton Disease" has broken out again with fresh virulence [sc. amongst horses in Southland], and the area over which the animals are affected has been considerably extended.<i>Ibid.</i> IV/41"Winton Disease".

It appears to have carried off many horses and cattle during the last ten or twelve years... Some have an opinion that ragwort is the cause of the disease, while others are opposed to this view.
