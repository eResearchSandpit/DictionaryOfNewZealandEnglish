Quote: ... a bullocky named Bob Anderson, ... , could not get his team to cross the bridge over the Erehwon woolwash creek, ... However, I worked on Erehwon years ago. In fact, I camped with Jerry O'Brien in the old woolwash buildings. There is a small creek, not far from the woolshed, called Woolwash Creek, wherein Pringle scoured his clip.
