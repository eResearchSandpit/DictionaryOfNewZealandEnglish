Quote: There were no fern trees in the nearest bush, so the construction of the huts [c1840] was of a decidedly wattle-and-daub nature, but all were roofed with thatch. <i>Ibid.</i> 41 These huts were of the old-time `wattle-and-daub' construction - that is, posts were driven into the ground and `wattles' (round sticks) were nailed across them 4 or 5 inches apart, and then clay was `daubed' in between and around them and smoothed over.
