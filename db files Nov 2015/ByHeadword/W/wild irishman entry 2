Quote: The diggings [at Dunstan] extend 80 miles one way and fifteen another. If you want to boil a pot you have to hunt about for dead `Wild Irishmen' a nasty prickly little shrub. The high lands abounded with `Spaniards' I suppose from their cut-throat propensities. A kind of very thick grass, grows in a little lump.

Quote:  [Fantastic plant-names] show the imagination running riot; they seem appropriate though often it is impossible to give any definite reason for the name. No trace has been found for the name `wild-irishman' as applied to Discaria toumatou. Many old settlers have been questioned without result, or with such barren result as the following: One being asked, `Why was the wild-irishman called the wild-irishman?' answered `I suppose because it is like a wild Irishman.' `What characteristics have they in common?' `Well, I-I-I really can't say.' And so it is; it is a name that everyone understands, but no one can explain. Whilst it is often written with a capital, it is now as often written with a small letter, `irishman'.
