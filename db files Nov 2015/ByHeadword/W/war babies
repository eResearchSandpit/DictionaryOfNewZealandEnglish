Quote: The men from the Antipodes have brought with them a humour and a slang of their own. Their definition of the various batches of volunteers is worth quoting. The first contingent became known as `The Tourists' ... . The came `The Dinkums' ... then ... `The Super-Dinkums', `The War Babies' and `The Hard Thinkers', the latter having thought a great deal before they came.
