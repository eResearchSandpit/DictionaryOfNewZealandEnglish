Quote: <i>Up the boo-ay </i>means `altogether wrong'. This seems to me a commoner meaning for <i>boo-ay</i> than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the <i>Pelican History of New Zealand</i>, with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <i>woop woops</i> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as <i>wook wooks), the sticks, the tea tree</i> and <i>the cactus</i> some semantic differentiation is not impossible. It must be pointed out that my meaning for <i>up the boo-ay</i> is already supplied by <i>up the chute</i>, however.
