Quote: A voyager on Cook's third voyage in <i>Discovery </i> in 1772, Dr Sparrman, notes that `the green stuffs which were cooked with pease and broth or used as salads, consisted of wild celery (<i>Apium prostratum </i>), wild spinach (<i>Tetragonia expansa </i>) and Cook's scurvy grass (<i>Lepidum oleraceum </i>).' The last mentioned, known as <i> nau </i> by the Maori, has nowadays been virtually eaten out of existence by sheep and cattle.
