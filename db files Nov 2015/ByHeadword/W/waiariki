Quote: The word Puia is especially used in the Taupo country, to designate the intermittent, geyser-like fountains of Tokanu ... and of Whakarewarewa on Lake Rotorua. Puia has ... the more general meaning of crater or volcano, and is applied to active as well as extinct volcanoes. ... Ngawhas [is] a term specially used for non-intermittent springs, for the solfataras and sulphurous hot-springs on the Rotomahana, Rotorua, and Rotoiti. Finally, the springs suited to bathing purposes, the water of which never reaches the boiling point, and all naturally warm baths are called `Waiariki,' corresponding to the Laugar of Iceland.

Quote: Hochstetter divides the steam jets into three kinds:  1. <i>Puias</i>, which are geysers, continuously or intermittently active.  2. <i>Ngawas</i>, which are inactive <i>Puias</i> - emitting steam, but not throwing up columns of water.  3. <i>Waiarikis</i>, which mean any sort of cistern of hot water suitable for bathing.
