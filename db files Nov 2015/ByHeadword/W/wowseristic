Quote: Whether <i>wowser</i> (a prohibitionist, an excessively religious person, a kill-joy) originated in Australia or New Zealand is uncertain, and so is its etymology. [fn 13] It gained some popularity in New Zealand during World War I. The adjective <i>wowseristic</i> has been formed from it. [fn] See Mencken, <i>The American Language</i> (4th ed., 1936), p. 265. The word was in use in New Zealand as early as 1895. [??is evidence in Mencken]
