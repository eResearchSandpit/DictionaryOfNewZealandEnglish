Quote: This cool, bright Sunday morning has drawn a good-sized group of "windlers", a term coined by Aucklander Mark Steele to describe fun sailing of the modern-yacht variety...We differentiate ourselves from competitive model-yacht sailors because windling is more about camaraderie and good fellowship... The America's Cup crew in San Diego were known to windle away lay days with mock matches in the marina.
