Quote: We ran down the coast; and ... the weather was beautiful, the sea smooth as a lake - indeed, a dead calm; when suddenly a squall came from the mountains, which very nearly laid us on our beam ends. All was confusion in an instant, the sea heaving up masses of foam in all directions, though not a cloud was visible in any part of the horizon. These sudden squalls are called<i> `Willies',</i> at least such is the name given to them by the sailors who frequent the island. [1966 fn] The word, with a similar meaning, is included in a modern vocabulary of Tristan da Cunha. Crawford, pp. 158, 268.

Quote: The skipper ... was a French Canadian. There were three men besides, one an old whaler, another a native of Nova Scotia, the third ... [from] the Azores ... [We] entered Queen Charlotte's Sound. By this time the wind had increased to a gale from the North West, and blowing over the low ridge which divides the Sound from Port Gore, it came to us in `williwaws', that is, violent puffs, succeeded by temporary calms. You can see the Williwaw coming from a long distance; the sea is blown up in a cloud of spray; curling and whirling it sweeps down upon you, and immediately before it comes, `Let go,' shouts the skipper, and the fore and main sheets are let go, blocks rattle, masts strain, canvas flaps violently, and the weight of wind forces the vessel nearly on her beam ends. Then in half a minute it is nearly a dead calm.

Quote: A special inconvenience [in Queen Charlotte Sound] introduced me to a new word - viz., the `willy waughs', [[fn] Thus was I instructed to spell.] brief gusts of wind that blew across the sound, carrying spindrift with them. Sometimes, crossing the mouth of a bay, we caught these gusts full and were well-nigh drenched. ... In Wellington I was assured that `willy waugh' was a Scotch word, also that it was a corruption from the Maori `wirriwa', which I later found did not exist. On my return to my dictionaries in Melbourne, I found the word in the Standard as Patagonian. `Willi-wa, a violent wind from mountains in the fiords of Patagonia'. An this be true (and I can find no more about it), by what process, through what book, did the word pass from Patagonia to Queen Charlotte Sound? The `willi-waught' of `Auld Lang Syne' means a draught of liquor, a long drink, not a sprinkling of wet externally.
