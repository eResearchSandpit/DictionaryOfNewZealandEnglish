Quote:  ...it is worthy of notice, that the colonists, soon after the formation of all the settlements, acquired distinguishing epithets; thus there was an Auckland cove, a Wellington swell, a Nelson snob, a Taranaki exquisite, an Otago cockney, and a Canterbury pilgrim. These epithets, almost already forgotten, are too characteristic to be buried in oblivion, as each originated in some peculiarity of the leading colonists. The Otago settlers derived theirs from their ignorance of the country in which they lived; the Auckland people from their extensive Sydney connexions; and the origin of the other names are sufficiently obvious without explanation.
Notes: also in 1941 Baker, p. 24
