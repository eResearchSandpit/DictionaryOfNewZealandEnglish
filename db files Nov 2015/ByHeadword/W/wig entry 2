Quote:  Q. Is any oil obtained from the seals ...? A. There is. A pup seal will give about 2 gallons more or less. A wig, that is an old male seal, will yield 5 or 6 gallons.

Quote: Incoming skins are sorted to arbitrary standards - wigs (old males), clap-matches (females), bulls, yearlings, grey or silver pups (under one year), black pups. If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.
