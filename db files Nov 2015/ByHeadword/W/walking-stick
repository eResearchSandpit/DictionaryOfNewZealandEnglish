Quote: (Bathgate) One of these [strange insects found in Otago] is the `walking-stick' of the colonists, which is an apterous insect, belonging to the order <i>Orthoptera </i>and the tribe Phasiuma [Phasma]. It derives its name from an extraordinary resemblance to a twig.

Quote: The application of the word `Phasiuma' to the insect commonly called the `walking-stick' is probably an error of the printer. It should be `Phasma', and the hyphen placed between `walking' and `stick' should be omitted - the common name having been given from its resemblance to an animated twig, and not (as the hyphen would suggest) from any resemblance to a stick we use in walking.
