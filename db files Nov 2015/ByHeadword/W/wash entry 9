Quote: <i>Wash</i>.- Place and plant for washing sheep. Until the 1870s washing sheep before shearing was a fairly common practice. If the sheep were hot- water washed, their owner had to build an expensive apparatus. The remains of these <i>sheep washes</i> were not uncommon twenty years ago. If there were technical terms for this process they are not recorded here, except that the most important place was at the spout. Everybody used to get very wet.

Quote: `Much of the wool was scoured on the farm [in the early days], especially the merino. ... But scoured wool took a good deal of time - the bales were carted to the washpool, the wool washed, dried and turned in the open - wind and rain stopped work frequently'. `There was a `wash' and a drying paddock at both Longlands and Haldon; the pool was fed by a race which had to be cleaned out before each shearing and kept in repair ...'

Quote: The creeks look very well for gold; splendid quartz boulders, and a fine wash, but could not get bottom anywhere, as it is too deep. Saw the bottom high up the creek, but very hard and no gold.

Quote: ... as the bar [in the river] commenced to dry in patches [as the river dropped], our hopes were high. The prospects were splendid. The wash was about six inches thick, lying on a false bottom, consisting of a thin layer of rusty cement, and under that thin white gravel [at Gabriel's Gully].

Quote: Great attention should be paid to the gold saving appliances, as no matter how much wash is treated, if you do not save the gold it will be impossible for the dredge to pay. There should be a save-all box as well. This box can be of wood or iron, fitted up with steel ripples, and should be placed in such a way as to catch all of the dirt that escapes the main shoot or drop plate.

I said. <i>Ibid.</i> 69 I was invited ... to stop the weekend [near Cromwell], and as Donald was going out ... to try the wash in a nearby burn, I thought it a great idea. <i>Ibid.</i> 69 ... all we got for our trouble with the tin dish were a few colours and black sand, which is always an indication that you are in gold-bearing wash.
