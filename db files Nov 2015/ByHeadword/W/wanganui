Quote: Believe it or not, this mouth-watering delicacy is called a Wanganui and it's a popular item at Dorothy's Patisserie in downtown Wellington... But before you rush off to the Race Relations Office, hear Rood out. He has been selling Wanganuis for years, long before the place became a byword for urban renewal, and the recipe dates back to the 1930s when someone from Wanganui worked in the shop for a while... For the record, a Wanganui costs $1 and consists of butter cream wedged between biscuits darkened by cocoa powder. What next - chocolate kenmairs?
