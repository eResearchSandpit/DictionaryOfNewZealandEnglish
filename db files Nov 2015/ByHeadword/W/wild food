Quote: I'm always ready for a new challenge, such as Monteith's Wild Food matching has tossed at us... The guts of the whole "promo" is that restaurants and cafes must come up with two different courses, dishing up "wild foods" that are not farmed, but that measure up to health regs.

Quote: Petit Lyon owner-chef Kent Baddeley asked himself this question and his witty reinvention of Kiwiana won him the Monteith's Wild Food Challenge in Wellington last night... Baddeley's "pie and gravy" comprised chunks of venison, wild duck and black swan, served in a tall potato-topped pie with game gravy, matched with Monteith's Celtic Red Beer.

Sixteen restaurants have created a special menu of wild (and for some) wonderful fare ... think very wild, as in jellyfish & prawns with spicy Asian dressing, seared rabbit livers, braised  kidneys, fried sweetbreads & poached tongues, or perhaps a galantine of wild birds.
