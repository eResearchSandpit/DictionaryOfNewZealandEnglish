Quote: A sign on the corner of the shelter points to the left, announcing the bushwalk... But if you'd prefer the bushwalk and a look at the Manawatu River, go straight ahead and through the "wriggle gate" (the sort designed to keep out cyclists) and turn right down the hill... The perimeter track zigzags through another pair of wriggle gates before going straight for a further 150 yards...
