Quote: A speaker on a local Maori radio station... told listeners that he had been <i>whanau-ed</i> as a child... The verb <i>to whanau</i> will be instantly accessible to most people, meaning the speaker's upbringing had been enriched by the input from uncles and aunts, grandparents, cousins and second cousins, an advantage rarely accorded to a non-Maori child.
