Quote: ECCLESTON Irish Kiwi 96 The usual procedure, on the appointed Saturday morning, was for all those who wished to avail themselves of the services of this 'way-back' barber, to line up on the seat that ran outside the cookhouse and wait their turn. His visit came as a surprise, for he seldom came down from his isolated home in the 'wayback' district more frequently than twice a year. [way-back]
