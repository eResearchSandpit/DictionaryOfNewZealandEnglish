Quote: I saw a ghastly array of departed and altogether forgotten West Coasters on this stormy night off Paringa. In the morning I found that the Something which conjured up these ghastly visions, taking the shape of many Westlanders in spirit land, was the steward's towel hanging on the cabin door.
