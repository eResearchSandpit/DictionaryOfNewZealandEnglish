Quote: Another weka stew graced the festive board at dinner-time that day, but as the repast too frequently resolved itself into a vulgar struggle between the repasters and the defunct birds for the possession of a gutta-percha-like fragment of flesh tied on to a leg bone, the incidents of the orgie [sic] are subjects scarcely meet for publications among these disjointed memoirs.
