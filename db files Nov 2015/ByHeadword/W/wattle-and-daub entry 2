Quote: I shall describe Govt House. Govt House is a Mauri built dwelling of Wattle and dab and Wattle and dab is this. A number of stakes are driven into the ground and a species of [v]ine worked in between them so as to form a wall of basketwork exactly like a Gabion. This big basket is then pelted with soft clay until all the interstices are completely filled up both inside and out and then the ragged bits are carfully smothed [sic] off when dry it makes a tolerably good wall.
