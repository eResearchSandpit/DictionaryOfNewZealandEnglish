Quote: There are games recorded in this period for which there is no record before 1900 though they  may well have existed under other names. <i>West Coast</i>: Dunk and Davey, Spang Weazling; <i>Wellington</i>: Who Goes Round My Stone Wall, Beg o' My Neighbor, Bellahonie, Run a Mile, On and Off the Bridge, Here Come Two Nuns, Colours, Isaac and Rebecca. Scrag, Diabolo, Bumble Puppy, Homai, Fives; <i>Auckland:</i> My Fair Young Lady, Rushes and Reeds, Surrender the Tower, Walls, Ball Hopscotch, ball games, Solomon Says; <i>Hawkes Bay:</i> Wolf Wolf Go Home, Homai; <i>Canterbury</i>: Poor Old Tom, Rats and Rabbits and Rips, Steps, Skin the Snake, Steal a Peg, Toodle-em-Buck, The Gag; <i>Golden Bay</i>: Who's That Walking Round My House Tonight, I've Come to See Poor Mary Jane, Steps and Stairs, Creeping, Branding, O'Leary; <i>Otago</i>: Sir Roger de Coverley, Who's That Knocking at My Door. <i>Ibid.</i> 273 Ball-bouncing games have come into their own on the asphalt playgrounds of modern schools and are played in many schools throughout the country. There is no evidence of such games before 1900, but a number of instances between 1900 and 1920 are recorded. The games were known as Fives, Tens, Sevens, and Walls and have been recorded more often since under the names O'Leary or Sevens. Before 1920 there is only one report of the game being played with a rhyme, and this was a rhyme more often used in skipping.
