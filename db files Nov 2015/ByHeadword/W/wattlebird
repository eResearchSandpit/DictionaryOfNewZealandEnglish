Quote: ... the once silent woods now resound with the blows of the felling-axe ... the Wattle-bird is no longer to be found in its old haunts; it seeks shelter amongst the higher parts of the bushy gullies ... the condition of the forest is changing under the effects of ... constantly-recurring bush fires. ... The Kokako loving a moist temperature will probably soon entirely forsake its ancient places of resort.
