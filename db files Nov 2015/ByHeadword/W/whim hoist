Quote: <i>Whim hoist</i>: A hoisting device operated by a horse and used in the very early days on No 2 shaft and on the Union No 1 shaft. A large drum with the winding-rope on it was mounted vertically and equipped with a long arm to which the horse was attached. By walking in a circle the horse pulled up the bucket by rotating the drum.
