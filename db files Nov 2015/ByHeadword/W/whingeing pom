Quote: TVNZ said "Poms" was a term used affectionately by Kiwis and Australians, and it rejected the complainants' view that the word was comparable to terms such as "Chinks",  "Wogs", or "Horis". It agreed expressions such as "Pommy bastards" and "whingeing Poms" were terms of abuse. Authority chairman Sam Maling noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's ruling that the words "Pom" and "Pommy" were unlikely to offend of insult.

Quote: Rosemary McLeod's column sucks. Who needs to import "whingeing Poms" when our own "home-grown" Kiwi (with her Scottish surname) can outwhinge them all (and stir up some racial disharmony while she's at it - nice one)?
