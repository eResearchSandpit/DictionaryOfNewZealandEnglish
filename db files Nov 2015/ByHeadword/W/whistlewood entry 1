Quote: SWAN Grunter Hunters 169 With a rattling crash he landed on a clump of whistlewood and there he clung on for grim moments while he regained his confidence. The whistlewood was halfway down the face and had he not landed on it Darryl would have fallen another six metres onto the rocks in the little creek below.
