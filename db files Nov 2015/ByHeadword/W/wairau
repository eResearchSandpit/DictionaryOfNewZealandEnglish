Quote: Yields of Wairau in these trials were not affected by wilt, and Saranac yielded as much as Wairau. Where wilt seriously reduces the productive yield of Wairau, Saranac can be expected to remain productive for perhaps twice as long. Saranac is a coarser lucerne than Wairau and not so good for producing high-quality hay.
