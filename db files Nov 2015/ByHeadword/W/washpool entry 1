Quote:  `Much of the wool was scoured on the farm [in the early days], especially the merino. ... But scoured wool took a good deal of time - the bales were carted to the washpool, the wool washed, dried and turned in the open - wind and rain stopped work frequently'. `There was a `wash' and a drying paddock at both Longlands and Haldon; the pool was fed by a race which had to be cleaned out before each shearing and kept in repair ...'
