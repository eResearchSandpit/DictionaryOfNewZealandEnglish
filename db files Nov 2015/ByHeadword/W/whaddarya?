Quote: At 80mg, you've reached the giggling, who-gives-a-stuff level, the 'I've always noticed I drive better when I'm drunk' stage, the point at which you ask yourself "Wodareyer? A big girl's blouse?" when you have twinges of befufddled conscience as you start fumbling the key into the lock.

Quote: Colin Meads didn't need any blindfolds or fancy "man management"; he made do with a sheep under each arm and a  decent-sized King Country hill. Fun? "Whaddarya?", as they said in <i>Foreskin's Lament</i>.

Quote: These poems are at their weakest when they are either self-consciously striving to establish Turner's black singlet paddock-cred ("cobbers" talk about the "footie" and revile the smooth talkers from "the Big Smoke", etc), or openly lament the metrosexualisation of the New Zealand bloke: "but oh, real Kiwi jokers, Whaddarya / even Valentine's Day has caught on like the pox".

Quote: The show.. searches for some kind of explanation as to why the game [sc. rugby] has meant so much to us, a response to the question barked across a frosty training field in <i>Foreskin's Lament</i>: "Whaddarya?"

Quote: [Hdg] WoddAREyer, a big girl's blouse?.. It wasn't the trendy dance drug Fantasy that caused last weekend's death of yet another young male chance-taker. It was the dread cry WoddAREyer.. The authorities should instead think about the central role played by WoddAREyer, the chorus of ridicule so feared by young males... Under the threat of WoddAREyer, young men won't back off from taking an unnecessary risk.

Quote: "Each individual comes under group pressure to assert their acceptance of the group values by joining in anti-women behavour," Phillips says. To abstain from such behaviour invites endless ribbing, accusations that you're a poofter or effeminate." It's the "whaddarya?" mentality, he says, citing the famous line from Greg McGee's play <i>Foreskin's Lament.</i>"

Quote: The play was a lament for the innocence of a lost small-town rugby culture, nowhere more powerful than in the concluding (and very theatrical) "lament" - a long monologue wherein Foreskin poured out his misery, his inability to cope with his lost sense of self. The final words were the cry "Whaddarya? Whaddarya? Whaddarya?", as eloquent an interrogation of our notions of masculinity as New Zealand literature has produced.... Maybe the original play (and especially its conclusion) was just too theatrical to be filmed. Or maybe somebody should ask Greg McGee if he's an insightful commentator on New Zealamnd mores, or a purveyor of bland entertainments of "international" (that is, nowhere) appeal. Whaddarya?

Quote: Whaddarya? - a question that has entered our cultural lexicon. A signifier of an unsavoury side of New Zealand male behaviour on and off the footy field. It was the catchcry of a young man called Foreskin in Greg McGee's play <i>Foreskin's lament</i>.
