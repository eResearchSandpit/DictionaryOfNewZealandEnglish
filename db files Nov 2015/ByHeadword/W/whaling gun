Quote: <i>A Whale Gun.</i> [heading] ... Down at the whaling station at Kaikoura some time ago I saw the first breechloader ... manufactured in this country. This was a whaling gun used for harpooning `right' and humpback whales by the Johnson party ... The sight of this harpoon-gun ... set me thinking.
