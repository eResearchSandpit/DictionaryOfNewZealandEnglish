Quote: A clear frontrunner for each and any marketing, public relations or packaging award in the `best socio-intellectual catch-phrase of `86' category: `White flight.' Think about it, talk it out, see and hear how it rolls off your tongue. Doesn't matter what it means or involves or entails - the two-word phrase is the attention-grabbing winner of the year. With such curt alliteration, it doesn't matter that what's in contention is actually a complex educational, socio-economic and racial issue. It has miraculously been reduced to the limits of the number of letters an <i>Evening Post</i> headline writer can squeeze into a front-page banner, which number also equates to the newspaper's collective IQ. So what the hell is `white flight' anyway? According to race relations conciliator Wally Hirsch, it's that startling new phenomenon of honky parents taking their kids away from schools whose rolls have significant numbers of different-tinted folk. -->1986 May 23 Dominion 14 Sir, - Much has been said about the `white flight' from Maori schools. I assure you this is not new. When we lived near Rotorua in the 1960s, people of Pakeha descent would pay to send their children miles to school, rather than send them to schools with a predominantly Maori roll.

Quote: The Race Relations Conciliator ... has aroused much controversy since he coined the phrase `white flight' to describe parents of European - as opposed to the offensively racist and discriminatory term Pakeha - ancestry moving their children to schools where due emphasis is placed on values the majority of New Zealanders still adhere to.

Quote: The parents caught up in the `white flight' phenomenon have been taken unawares by the quiet revolution among a significant group of Pakeha who have steadily embraced the concept of biculturalism.
