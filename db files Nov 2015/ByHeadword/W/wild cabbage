Quote: The natives had a large copper mowrie to cook the pork they had brought with them, and for the first time I saw them eat the common milk-[52]thistle. They cook it as constantly as the leaves of the wild turnip and cabbage, and seem to relish it just as much. It is so precisely like the English milk-thistle that I am almost inclined to think it must have come with the potatoes.
