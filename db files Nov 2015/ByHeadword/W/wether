Quote: There perhaps 30 metres away stood an big old merino-cross wether, carrying, at the least, a double fleece, the dirty grey colour of which explained my missing his presence among the jumbled summit rocks.

Quote: <i>Ages of sheep.</i> Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a<i> hogget</i> until shorn. A male lamb is a<i> ram lamb</i> until castrated, then a <i>wether</i>. A female lamb is a <i>ewe lamb</i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i>shorn hogget </i>until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a<i> two-tooth.</i> Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i>four-tooth,</i> then a <i>six-tooth</i> and then an<i> eight-tooth </i>or<i> full-mouthed</i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.
