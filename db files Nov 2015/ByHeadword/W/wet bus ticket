Quote: I emailed an American sports writer this week to se if he could explain the apparent lack of anything other than a wet bus ticket to persecute drug cheats... To avoid these unseemly confrontations cluttering the team during the season, the leagues and the players' associations come up with the wet bus ticket penalties and try to avoid the lawsuits and ensuing fallout to ensure both sponsors and team money men keep the tills ticking over.
