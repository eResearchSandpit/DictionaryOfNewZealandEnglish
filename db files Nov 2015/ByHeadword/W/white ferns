Quote: Ten points for originality to whoever had the bright idea of naming our women's cricket team the White Ferns. It can't have been too hard. The netball teams has dibs on the Silver Ferns and the rugby team has claimed the Black Ferns. Guess that only left one option, really. It's certainly not the most menacing of names. In keeping with the Black Caps, perhaps the side should have been named the Black Cats. At least it would conjure up images of claws and fangs, and not pretty native shrubs. [Rachel Smalley]
