Quote: The verb <i>to wait</i> has acquired an otiose preposition in ordinary use; one is told to `wait on' rather than to `wait', but if any prepositional sense was ever felt in on - as in the American `wait on me' - it has now been lost.

Quote:  My father came from ... Dorset in 1880, one thing we used to say always amused him, and that was `Wait on' for `Wait for me'. I suppose I picked it up at school, as we certainly did not hear it at home.
