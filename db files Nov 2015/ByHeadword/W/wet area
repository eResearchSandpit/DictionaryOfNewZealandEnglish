Notes: Jim Cameron writes: NSOD gives the general sense, but the words (wet area) and several compounds have considerable historic significance in NZ from the 1890s almost up to the the present. DNZE does not record these - <i>wet/dry area, district, vote; go wet, stay dry</i>. NZPOD has no entry for wet in this sense but does for dry.

Quote: Established by plebiscite at election time in New Zealand there were 'wet' areas where pubs could be built and liquor sold, and 'dry' areas where they could not. In the case of Henderson the divider between wet and dry was the local railway line, and Mr Assid Corban, a Lebanese who had planted vines and was making wine, found his house and sheds on the dry side of the tracks. This problem he solved by buying tom the railways a very small earth-floored concrete shelter, only a few yards from his house but across the tracks on the wet side. From there he began selling wine in flagons to passing motorists.
