Quote: The traditional waka is a canoe; today's waka could be the rusty Honda Civic in which the poet has transported his whanau over the years, and which has now gone to the wrecker's yard; while tomorrow's waka could be a space-ship "rocketing to another orb / singing waiata to the spheres."

Quote: Waka were a big success. There's something raw and sensual about a huge bunch of guys paddling, and it's very New Zealand too. Let's put them in every scene. We could have Interisland waka. X-wing waka, for an inspiring war scene in space. Whitbread waka. Sedan and convertible waka in five-speed and automatic. Any time the pace flags, throw in some waka.
