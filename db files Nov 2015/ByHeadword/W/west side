Quote: On the west coast of the Middle Island, commonly called by the whalers the `West Side,' we heard a good deal both from the whites and the natives. All accounts agreed that it is of a most rugged and inaccessible character. <i>Ibid.</i> 261 The kivi, called by the sealers the emu, is met with in great abundance on the west side. It is a common article of food with them, being caught with the assistance of dogs. It seems likely that there are two species of kivi, one much larger than the other.
