Quote: BOWEN Wool Away! 86 .. a wing really puts a small brake on the shearer's hand  .. it is a good practice to have the outside wing bent out as it is not so much in the wool, and does collect the odd 'whisker' that would otherwise be missed. Don't overbend it into an ugly wing - it needs only a slight bend.
