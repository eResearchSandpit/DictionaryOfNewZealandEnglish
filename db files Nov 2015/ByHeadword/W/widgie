Quote: During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city. These young people congregated in the streets and milk-bars. Many of them had motor-cycles ... At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'...  [2] Bodgies and Widgies are members of a closely knit sex cult. This cult is centred and operates actively in Australia (and especially in Sydney). As far as is known, the cult itself does not operate in Christchurch, though [3] many boys and girls imitate its fashions and share with its adherents an interest in jive. The dress of these youngsters resembles that of the Teddy Boy and Girl, but is not so immaculate; hair is worn long and brushed back, without the characteristic Teddy Boy tuft; behaviour tends to be more boisterous and `attention provoking'. In this report such phrases as `Teddy Boy style' or `Bodgie type' are used purely as descriptive terms, to indicate certain fashions of dress which show these overseas influences.

Quote: The terms "Bodgie" and "Widgie" arepeculiar to the middle 20th Century, butthe characteristics are not... In theunder-privileged masses the counterpartsof Bodgies were variously styled as'yahoos', 'larrikins', 'hooligans' and'yobs'. The 'playboy' of upper classsociety is the "Bodgie" of the poor.
