Quote: The natives had a large copper mowrie to cook the pork they had brought with them, and for the first time I saw them eat the common milk-[52]thistle. They cook it as constantly as the leaves of the wild turnip and cabbage, and seem to relish it just as much. It is so precisely like the English milk-thistle that I am almost inclined to think it must have come with the potatoes.

Quote: The stones having been made red-hot, the provisions, which consisted of fish ..., after being cleansed and bound up in the leaves of the kaha [a's-acute], or wild turnip, which almost covers every spare surface of vegetable soil in the country, ... were all placed in a basket on the hot stones, ... <i>Ibid.</i> 2/134 Not a spot on the earth lay waste; many parts teeming with the keha [e,a-acute] or wild turnip whose yellow flower on stalks of six feet in height, covered the distance, as far as the eye could discern, and emitted a pleasing fragrance.

Quote: There are also several grasses, as well as <i>wild carrots, turnips,</i> and <i>cabbages,</i> whose origin, from their similarity to ours, may be attributed to the visits of some European shipping: and a <i>sowthistle</i> grows very luxuriantly wherever the forest has been recently felled, affording nourishing fodder for pigs, horses, and cattle.

Quote: ... we found ourselves in Evans' Bay; and here, to our great surprise, we discovered wild oats and turnips growing luxuriantly. By whom the seed was first sown God only knows; but as the Maori designates the turnip Captain Cook's cabbage, I presume that great circumnavigator had something to do with it.

Quote: Among farm pests wild turnip, with its golden bloom, is an all too familiar feature, but as it only appears in land under cultivation it is not such a serious menace as the Californian thistle, which has now gained a strong and rapidly increasing hold in Otago and Southland.
