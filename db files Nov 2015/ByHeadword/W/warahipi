Quote: NICHOLSON The Loving Stitch 219 The technique, often called uruahipi or warahipi, where strands of wool fibre were drawn out of fleeces, rolled on the thigh and knitted had long been practised by Maori women fleece-os working in shearing sheds. Uruahipi was dying out but the Wool Week promotion revived the skill and introduced it to the general public as 'kiwicraft.'
