Quote: In contract sheds only fast men are welcomed by the `boss'. Some men who are what we term `guns,' are kept going all the season, and in many cases good honest shearers are cast off to make room for these `guns.' Of course, the `gun' shearer who comes along does not know that this has happened, as the `gun' shearers are as a rule good unionists, and would not demean themselves by `waiting for a death.' At the same time, the `boss' knows when the gun is cutting out, perhaps 200 miles away, and he knows from the other boss which way the `gun' is going, and everything is in readiness when he arrives at the shed.

Quote: bullet: An old word for `the sack' when one is dismissed from the job. The old custom of unemployed shearers waiting round in case someone got `the bullet' was called `waiting for a death'.
