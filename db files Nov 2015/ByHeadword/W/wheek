Quote: Wheek - to grizzle, whine (sulkily and/or intermittently). Usually of children. Used by C.F. Corne of Whangarei; but I use it, too, usually in `Stop (your) wheeking'. Maybe it is <i>weeking, wh</i> is an unstable phoneme for me. <i>Wheek </i>See <i>weak</i> V2 <i>veak</i> sb2 and vb Hmp Dev Corn 1) sb. A fit of ill-temper; a pasion, rage; a sudden capricious freak; a vagary; a whim. 2) v. In phr. <i>to go veaking about</i>, to be fretful <i>Queak</i> v and sb Sc also written queek. 1) v. To squeak, cry, as the young of rats and mice. 2) sb A gentle squeak, the weak, peeping cry of the young of small animals.
