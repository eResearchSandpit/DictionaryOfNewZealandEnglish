Quote: The cryptic world of weather forecasts has been congested further with: weather bomb.... MetService forecaster Shane Bidois said.. " I think Bob McDavitt used it in a press release... Mr McDavitt said it was when a low-pressure system lost one millibar of pressure every hour for 24 hours. "I was discussing with a colleague what to say and he suggested 'a particularly nasty low' ... but it was turning into a bomb and we wanted as many people as possible to brace themselves so we came up with the idea of calling it a 'bomb'," Mr McDavitt said.

Quote: The term "weather bomb", used in June of this year by forecasters in relation to a rapidly intensifying storm that was approaching New Zealand, struck a chord with the media, which trumpeted the warnings so loudly that few people would have missed the message that there was serious trouble on the way. <i>Ibid. </i> 15 The use of the phrase "weather bomb" to describe the storm excited a certain amount of controversy... In fact, the term "bomb' has been used in North America for more than 20 years to describe rapidly intensifying lows, some of which have ben known to deepen by 60 hPa in 24 hours off the  east coast of the United States. One definition of a bomb is a low that deepens at a rate of 24 hPa in 24 hours at latitude 60a. When adjusted to the latitude of Auckland to allow for the effects caused by the curvature of the earth's surface, this is the equivalent of 17 hPa in 24 hours.
