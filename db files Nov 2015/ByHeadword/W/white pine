This is a straight, narrow, sometimes conical tree, growing on wet flats; wood of little value. <i>Ibid.</i> 32 A large round-headed tree, also called White Pine in Otago, and Silver Pine in Nelson, is not uncommon near Dunedin; it is probable that the male and female plants differ in their leaves, similar to the Kahikatea; the timber is valuable for boat-building.
