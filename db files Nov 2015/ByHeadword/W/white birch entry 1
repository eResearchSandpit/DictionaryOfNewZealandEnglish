Quote:  ... the prevailing species of trees [in Otago] are remo [rimu], totara, and tall manuka, all indicative of inferior soil.... The bush-like woods on the east side are of white birch, likewise no recommendation of the soil, but the chief objection to the district is, that the prairie soil affords scarcely any food for cattle ... it grows only the wiry tree grass [tussock] ... and <i>Phormium tenax</i> [flax], no aniseed, perennial groundsel, or milk thistle, and very little couch grass.

Quote: <i>[Notho]fagus Cliffortioides,</i> Hook. f. ... Mountain beech. Black Birch of portions of Wellington, Canterbury, Otago and Southland. White Birch of Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. Barely distinguished by the woodman from Entire-leaved beech. The mountain beech bears a close resemblance to the entire-leaved beech in general appearance, although it never attains the extreme dimensions of that species.

Quote: <i>Birch trees/Beech trees</i>: Bush or forest in the high country consists almost entirely of <i>Nothofagus cliffortioides</i> , the mountain beech. These were always known as birch by the early settlers, and high country men usually call them 'white birch'.
