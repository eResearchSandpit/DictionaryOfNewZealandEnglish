Quote: Hokitika.. is having its 13th Wildfoods Festival... Festival organiser Mike Keenan says the great thing about Wildfoods is that everybody gets a piece of the pie... Wildfooders seem to be tribal by nature and come dressed in matching Hawaiian shorts of T-shirts with club insignia such as "Booze hags, pissed since 1976" scrawled across the bosom.
