Quote: In New Zealand, for example, there is a local use of the word <i>watershed</i> to mean the catchment area which feeds a rive. It seems to be so use in a story by Philip Wilson [<i>Landfall</i>, no. 19, September 151, p. 180.] in the phrase `the deer that were destroying the watersheds'. An English lecturer in geography tells me that she has spent much time in trying to eradicate this usage from the essays of geography students.
