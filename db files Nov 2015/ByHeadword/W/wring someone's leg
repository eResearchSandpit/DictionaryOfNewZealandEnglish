Quote: Jim Wall, who wrung the Dominion's leg with enthusiasm about the soil and climate of Darling Downs, is one of the few young New Zealanders who imbibed Tory principles with his imported infants' food, and the result is to be found in his base ingratitude to the country of God which has turned him out fat in person and in pocket.
