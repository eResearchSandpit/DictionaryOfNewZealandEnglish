Quote: MCGREGOR A Dog's Life 23 There are two types of leading dogs. One is the dog that is capable of getting the sheep to follow while he leads in the front of the mob, and the other is known as the wing leader. The latter will take the lead when necessary but will also run back to keep the wing of the mob on either side from drifting.

Quote: LOUGHNAN Glossary II 3 wing leader: a dog, really only needed much in the early days of no fences, which travelled not at the head but at the flank of a driven mob tucking back any animals liable to stray aside. A good leader nowadays is often intelligent enough to watch for side roads, broken fences and open gates, and to scamper back without being bidden to reclaim anything that does stray aside.
