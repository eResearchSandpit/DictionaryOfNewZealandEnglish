Notes: I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names a la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig. Austral., a large refuse bin on wheels.
