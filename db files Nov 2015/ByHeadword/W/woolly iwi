Quote: This is a seasonal job and gives rise to phrases like: `Chaps <i>winter</i> at a certain job (e.g. shearing) in the <i>off-season</i>, and come back regularly. The season is divided into the <i>flush</i> when lambs are coming in (two <i>flushes</i> `grass-fed' and `rape-fed'). After the first flush of lambs, a lot of sheep come in, <i>woolly iwis</i> [wou li: |i:wi:z] as they are called. they are tougher than lambs and the tally is therefore less - 80 instead of 100 say; and they are often called <i>grannies</i> or <i>grandmother lambs. </i>
