Quote: In some of these old `whare puni' [sc. old pits over which a roof had been raised] trees of a considerable size are found growing. ... The `whare puni' is still used by the Maories in some out-of-the-way places. The side view at a short distance is that of a hillock, for the thatch of the roof is finally covered with earth; they are gable-ended, the roof projecting in front forming a kind of porch; there is one window and one door, both small, the latter a hand-and-knee affair as you go in or out.
