Quote: After walking about 4 or 5 miles, we came to McLeans [sic] wash and I went down to see how it was worked. ... They have only to divert a small stream and bring it down to the wash in a small race ... First, to take the rough off the sheep, they were swum through a creek in a basin built up on each side and deep, at the end they were thrown in at. ... A yard carried them on to the hot water soak ... and from there they are pushed down to the spouts, six in number.
