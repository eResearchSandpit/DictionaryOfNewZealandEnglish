Quote: GILHOOLY, <i>holding up a [fish] tail</i>: Will you just look at this dirty big wop-kacker! [note 98] <i>wop-kacker</i>: New Zealand slang for `thingummy', [does Mason mean penis?], implying size, proportion, remarkable qualities. Etymology dubious. Now slightly archaic; Miss Gilhooly's [99] stock of <i>argot</i> is behind the times, nor does she always know the full meaning of her blunt and scabrous expressions.
