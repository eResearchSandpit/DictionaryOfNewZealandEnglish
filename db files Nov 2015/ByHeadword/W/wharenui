Quote: The gate across the road into the Nga Hau e Wha Christchurch National marae is chained and double- padlocked. Behind the palisade fence the weeds are knee high. The whare nui is boarded up ... None of its carvings and tukutuku are in place and the carvings are still tapu. The whare wananga beside it, meant to house the kohanga reo, lies uncompleted, torn building paper flapping.

Quote: Wood used for carving and building carries with it the spirit of the tree, the spirit of place including the name of the place, and the spirit of the carvers who create the powerful images of tribal ancestors which decorate wharenui (meeting houses). ... Anyone who has spent time in a carved house (wharenui) will know the depth of feeling the carvings evoke, for they make the wharenui a living thing.
