Quote: ... as Mr Hughes and his [companion whalers at Onekakara] had long since drained their last can of grog, a capacious kettle of whalers' tea [128] stood on the hearth, ready for use of those who liked it. This tea, an infusion of `manuka' boughs, is a beverage much drunk by the whalers; it is very wholesome, and, not palatable at first, appears to be agreeable to those who have become accustomed to it.
