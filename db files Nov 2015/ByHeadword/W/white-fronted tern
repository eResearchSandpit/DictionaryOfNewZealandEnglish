Quote: WHITE FRONTED TERN (<i>Sterna striata</i>), Tara of the Maoris, is abundant all around the New Zealand coasts and occurs in Tasmania and Eastern Australia as well. This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.
