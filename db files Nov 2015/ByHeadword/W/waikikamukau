Quote: <i>Waikikamukau </i>imaginary archetypal Kiwi back-of-beyond village, with variant spellings, including <i>Waikikamookau</i> and <i>Waikukumukau,</i> former used by Minhinnick in 1920s humorous newspaper articles, the latter used by English writer Austin Mitchell in his 1972 <i>The Half-Gallon, Quarter-Acre Pavlova Paradise</i>. Becoming unacceptable in recent years, though school playgrounds may yet ask `Waikikamukau?' and answer, `Because it kicked me.'
