Quote: The Women's Land Corps, as it was first known, was formed as part of the Women's War Service Auxiliary in 1940 to help meet the acute shortage of land labour. In 1942 it was reorganised as the Women's Land Service, with better pay and conditions, plus a full working kit and dress uniform as an added attraction... The WLS was the "ugly duckling" of the auxiliary service, despite their years of arduous work and extraordinarily long hours.
