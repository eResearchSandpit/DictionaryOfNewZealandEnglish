Quote: My employment was chiefly in packing the woolbales which is very heavy work. You put from 90 to 120 fleeces in a bail which way [sic] from 300 to 350 lbs. It is hard to press the wool into so small a compass. We sheared some 850 sheep to-day.

Quote: When we got down to the wool-shed we lit a tallow candle, and having stuck it in an old bottle we sat down upon the wool bales and began to smoke. A wool-shed is a roomy place, built somewhat on the same plan as a cathedral, with aisles on either side full of pens for the sheep, a great nave, at the upper end of which the shearers work, and a further space for wool sorters and packers.
