Quote: More common, and also illegal, is the "waggle stick" - just a long slender stick, often with a white cloth flag at the end, which is used to frighten the shoals towards the river bank. Because the law prohibits their use, waggle sticks are usually hidden in the bush or secreted among the timber of the stand.

Quote: Another piece of equipment you might find useful is a swaggle stick, not that it is legal. Whitebait are pretty stupid, but occasionally they get it in their tiny minds to swim around your net instead of into it. This is when you need a swaggle stick. A pole, five yards long, with a shiny tin lid attached to the end. You stick it in the water and try to scare the recalcitrant whitebait back on course.
