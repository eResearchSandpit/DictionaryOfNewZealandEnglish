Quote: Walk-up - The command to bring a heading dog smoothly and slowly onto sheep - not tearing in and doing a spot of wool-classing. A lot of the purists teach the walk by putting the dog into a harness and walking it. An alternative .. until it realises that the new 'walk-up' command means exactly that.
