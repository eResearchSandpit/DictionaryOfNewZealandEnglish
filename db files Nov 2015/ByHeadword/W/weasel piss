Quote: [He] remembers the day he was able to waltz into the local working man's pub, order a cider and sit down for a drink without being teased. The "weasel piss" had come of age.... Picture this... [He] walks in, tried to flog his goods to the barman and gets told, "Why would we want to sell that weasel piss?"
