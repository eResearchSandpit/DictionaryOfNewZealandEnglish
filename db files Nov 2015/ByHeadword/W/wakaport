Quote: I write to respond to Mirek Marcanik.. about the "wakaport" (as he calls it) on the waterfront... The brief for a waka house was expanded to include facilities such as a meeting house and atea (open meeting space), cafe and a carving facility... The waka house has the potential to be a very exciting project for our waterfront.
