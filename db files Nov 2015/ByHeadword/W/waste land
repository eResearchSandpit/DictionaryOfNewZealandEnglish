Quote: Having by these methods obviated the dangers of the acquisition of large tracts of Country by mere Landjobbers, it will be your duty to obtain, by fair and equal contracts with the Natives, the Cession to the Crown of such Waste Lands as may be progressively required for the occupation of Settlers resorting to New Zealand.  All such contracts should be made by yourself, through the intervention of an Officer expressly appointed to watch over the interests of the Aborigines as their Protector.

Quote: At the same time, seeing that people were determined to emigrate, were enamoured of the Wakefield system, and had made up their minds to buy waste land at any price, as was the case a few years ago, it was certainly very reasonable conduct on the part of the British Government to pass such an Act [as Lord Stanley's].
