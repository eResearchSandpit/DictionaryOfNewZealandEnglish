Quote: At Tom's insistence, a call was made at a sheep station called Kahumingi; the owners, the Vallances, were good friends of his. Mrs Vallance's first husband, Donald Drummond, had suffered what was called the `Wairarapa Death'- drowning; and until she remarried, his widow had managed the big property herself.
