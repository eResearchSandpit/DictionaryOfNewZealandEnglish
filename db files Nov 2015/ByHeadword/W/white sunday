Quote: Mention White Sunday to almost any Samoan and a smile will cross their face as they recall some favourite memories... It's held once a year on the second Sunday of October and is sometimes called Children's Sunday - it's a church service especially for children and they perform the service as well... I remember back then, my mum driving around Auckland looking for the best white dresses for me and my sisters for White Sunday... In the scheme of things, White Sunday - Le Aso Sa Tamaiti has come to signify many things throughout my childhood years.
