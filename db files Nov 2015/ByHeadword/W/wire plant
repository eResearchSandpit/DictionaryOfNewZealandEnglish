Quote: `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: We call these trees and shrubs that can resist browsing by birds 'wire plant' in recognition of their tough, sinuous stems and their uniqueness to New Zealand... A very few wire plants are able to cope with mammals and this accounts for why they remain common. These have spines (for example matagouri) and the ability to form impenetrable hedges... Wire plants are perhaps best recognised by the tugging test - take a shoot of less than three millimetres in diameter, and pull. If it is hard to break then it is probably a wire plant!
