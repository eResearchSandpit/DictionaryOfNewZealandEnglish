Notes: cf non-wowser; John Norton, 1862-1916, journalist and politician.  Born Brighton, England, emigrated NSW 1884, 1890 invited to join editorial staff of Truth when it began publication in Sydney. Editor and part- owner 1891, dismissed for drunkenness, after "tortuous litigation". By 1896 had again become editor and sole proprietor. Noted for such things as section on Divorces headed "Prickly Pairs in the Garden." Claimed he invented the term wowser but this is disputed. C.  J. Dennis : A wowser is an ineffably pious person who mistakes this world for a penitentiary and himself for a warder.The first recorded use of the word is in Truth 8 Oct. 1899 but it is said to have been in spoken use for some years before. (also in attrib. or adj. use below)

Quote: Regarding the origin of the term `Wowser' discussed in this column, `F.M.' writes:- `During the latter part of the last century a crusade was launched by the Women's Christian Temperance Union against the social evils in Australia. One woman who spoke always had a ready answer to the jeers and jibes of her audience. On one occasion when she and her party were accused of being `kill-joys' she retorted `We only want social evils removed'. The initial letters of those words were taken up by her opponents, and `wowser' became a term of opprobrium which has continued to the present time'.

He generally - but not always-belongs to one of the Non-conformist churches. His pursuits are the holding of conventions and bun-rushes, at the latter of which he consumes marvellous quantities of indigestible tea and buns.

Quote: "Wowser" is a word unique to New Zealand and Australia. It is a word rapidly passing into extinction, because the type of person it describes - someone who is implacably opposed to alcohol and, by implication, to hedonistic indulgence of any kind - is also dying out. As the once-powerful temperance movement fades into history and a new generation of New Zealanders grows up accustomed to the civilised pleasures of a deregulated liquor industry, "wowser" is a word that seems to belong in the 50s.

Quote:  [Long discussion of meaning, and claim to invention by John Norton, <i>Aust Truth:</i> the article republished from Sydney `Truth' of 1910 May 15 5/6: See folder <i>Long quotations</i> (Wilkes 1899 Truth)] What the word wowser precisely means and the type of person it particularly designates is well known, best known to the Wowser h I [John Norton] invented the word myself. I was the first man to publicly use the word. I first gave it utterance in the City Council [Sydney?], when I applied it to Alderman Waterhouse, whom I referred to - I hope and believe with perfect good humor, and without gall or guile-as `the white, woolly, weary, wayery, word-wasting wowser from Waverley.' I am proud of my invention. The fabrication of such a word - absolutely absent from, but as absolutely required in our local vernacular until I invented and introduced it - was a stroke of genius, done on the spur of the moment, impromptu, the result of a divine or diabolical inspiration. Therefore, `Palmam qui meruit ferat' - the motto of Lord Nelson. Let it be the motto of John Norton in the circumstances of this case and for the purposes of establishing his claim to immortal glory as the inventor of the word Wowser.

Quote: Wowser is a term somewhat indefinite in its application and meaning. The following definitions given to the author by bushmen themselves may help the reader to understand what a Colonial means when he uses the word. It may mean:- 1) `A man who tries to rob a bloke of his beer and pleasure' - therefore especially applicable to the temperance reformer.2) `A bloke who wears out the knees of his pants on Sundays praying, and another part of his pants all the week backsliding' - i.e. a hypocrite. 3) `Any sky-pilot, priest, or local preacher who makes a bloke uncomfortable, and pretends to be religious.'
