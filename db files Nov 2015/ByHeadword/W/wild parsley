Quote:  HEMLOCK (<i>Conium maculatum</i>) is loosely called wild carrot or wild parsley in certain districts. It is a biennial found in waste places and rich grasslands in scattered localities in both islands. ... Hemlock has been famous from ancient times for the poison extracted from its roots and unripe seeds.
