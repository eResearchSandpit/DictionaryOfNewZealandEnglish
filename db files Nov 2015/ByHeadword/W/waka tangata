Quote: Waka were built for inland and coastal waterways, but were no longer needed for ocean voyaging. New types became common in Maori communities - waka taua, waka tete, waka tiwai, mokihi, and the modern-day waka tangata .. A late 20th century development has been the construction of canoes for educational purposes. Known as waka tangata, they are very similar to waka tete, with uncarved gunwales and stern posts of simple ornamentation.
