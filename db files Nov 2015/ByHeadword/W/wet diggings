Quote: Work in that country in wet diggings was not over pleasant, as old New Zealand diggers will well understand;  up to the middle all the day in water, and generally in a dripping state.

Quote: He explained to his readers that there were two kinds of diggings, the `wet' and the `dry'. The first were in the bed of the river, the water of which had often to be diverted in order that the diggers might wash the gold taken out. If these diggings offer a larger profit to those who strike the right spot, they have the disadvantage, that the necessary labour is hard and unhealthy, for the diggers must often stand breast-high in the cold water from the mountains. ... The dry diggings, which generally require more capital and strength, are to be found mostly on the heights or in the higher diluvium. The water must often be brought long distances in sluices. The earth containing the gold is thrown into the sluices, in which a double floor with numerous bored openings lie.
