Quote: Shortly after this chief had ended his speech they all, in a moment, threw off their mats, girt up their loins with their war belts, took their muskets, spears, and pattoo-pattoos, and left us in the village ... [186] His loins were girt with a broad war belt in which he carried his pattoo, and his spear was in his hand.
