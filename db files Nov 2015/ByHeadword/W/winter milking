Quote: Daily News July 5 Future for many lies in winter milking .. Rain and mild temperatures in May helped with grass growth, but the real key to the winter milking operation is the grain storage and meal feeding facilities .. He [Mr Begg] believes winter milking may become a practice of the future because, instead of having to pay premium prices for peak rights, farmers will draw the season out to a year-round operation.
