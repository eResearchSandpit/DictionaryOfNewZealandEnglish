Quote: What does Jones think about the technique advocated at some seminars and known as "wrapping"? Wrapping.. involves real estate investors giving loans to people to whom the bank refuses a loan. "The wrappers generally charge up to 20 per cent above the market value for a home. So if a home [19] is worth $100,000, the wrapper will sell it for $120,000. Then they charge much higher interest rate than the bank, some as high as 21 per cent."... "We don't promote wrapping at all, the reason being that the New Zealand Mortgage Brokers Association is very negative towards wrapping properties."
