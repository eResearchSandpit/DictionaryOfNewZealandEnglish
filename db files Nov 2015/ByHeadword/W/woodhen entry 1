Quote: At night, for supper, we had a fresh delicacy, a roasted Kiwi, locally called a `wood-hen,' rather like a hen pheasant, one of the surviving specimens of the Apteryx, or `wingless' bird, in New Zealand. It has a rudimentary wing, of one joint only, but is a ground bird, and if well cooked, so as to get rid of its superabundant oil, by no means uneatable.
