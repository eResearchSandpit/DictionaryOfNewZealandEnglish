Quote: Then on to one of the trams, already filling with rugby regulars that trundled up through Newtown to the Park. Once through the park gate we were out on to the empry, waiting, glorious green field, and running and climbing up to our favourite position (our own by a divine right I never questioned), right above the halfway line, way up high on the Western Bank... even today, I only have to close my eyes and I am back with Dad on our own high place on the Western Bank.
