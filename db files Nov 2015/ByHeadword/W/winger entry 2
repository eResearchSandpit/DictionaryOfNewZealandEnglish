Quote: In driving a big mob of scary sheep across country it was usual to flank it with a man on each wing who would guide the leaders in the right direction, the rest following. ... There were considerable beds of tutu in many places and the `winger's' job included steering the mob clear of these if possible, as hungry sheep are easily affected by this poison, specially in moist weather.
