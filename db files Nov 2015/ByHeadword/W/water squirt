Quote: To this end VENUS' NECKLACE has water-filled, swollen internodes; and the sea bomb is also filled with water [to prevent desiccation]. The existence of this water is known to most children, who call the plant the WATER SQUIRT. <i>Ibid.</i> 18 Sea Bombs or Water Squirt (</i>Adenocystis utricularis </i>)
