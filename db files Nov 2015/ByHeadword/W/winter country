Quote: All these stations in the mountain tussock lands would be divided by fencing into what was known as `summer' and `winter' country. The summer country was mostly comprised of the higher ranges and those lying away from the sun where the winter snowfall was heavy. Sheep were run on this range country through the summer months only, and brought down to the lower country - the winter country - in the late autumn. This consisted of rolling downs, the lower hills, and faces lying to the sun where snow did not lie.

Quote: That by making arrangement with other runholders to make common cause for certain runs, as against other runs, I succeeded, ultimately, after two severe contests, before the Waste Lands Board, with several opposing counsel, in not only saving the said license, but in gaining an addition of other country of great value - as winter country - which the said James Ure Russell then informed me, was equal to about 5000 acres in extend, and added several thousand pounds to the value of his run.
