Quote: In these important respects Wakefield's system offered useful, practical hints for colonizers. On the whole, however, it failed to work. The experiments in New Zealand produced colonies-but not `Wakefield' colonies. It proved impossible to regulate either the expansion of the frontier or the form of class structure by means of a price upon land.
