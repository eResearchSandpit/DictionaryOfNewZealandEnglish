Quote:  Another small structure with walls and a roof thatched with tree fern and called a `whata' was used [c1850s] as a store-room on the station, this was erected on four strong piles rising six feet out of the ground and encircled with tin near the upper part to keep off the rats, these vermin sometimes proving very destructive on account of their large numbers.

Quote: ``Futtah' is familar as `household words'. There were always rats in New Zealand--that is, since any traditions of its <i> fauna </i> existed. The original ones were good to eat. They were black and smooth in the hair as the mole of the Old Country, and were esteemed delicacies. They were always mischievous, but the Norway rat that came with the white man was worse. He began by killing and eating his aboriginal congener, and then made it more difficult than ever to keep anything eatable out of reach of his teeth. Human ingenuity, however, is superior to that of most of the lower animals, and so the `futtah' came to be - a storehouse on four posts, each of them so bevelled as to render it impossible for the cleverest rat to climb them. The same expedient is to-day in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast in fact, wherever properly constructed buildings are not available for the storage of things eatable or destructible by the rodents in question.' ... ][Futtahs are today in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast. -

Quote: <i> Futtah:</i> a station store, built on high posts to keep rats and mice out. Both the design and the name are borrowed from the Maoris. Some people used to call them watties. With the increasing use of iron and concrete they are becoming rare; the last built, I think, I put up at Braemar in 1910. (PAUL, p.90, where it is spelt wata; [1898 Morris Austral-English])
