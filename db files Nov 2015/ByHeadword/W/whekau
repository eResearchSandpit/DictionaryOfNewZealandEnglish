Quote: Amongst the strange ornithological forms that occur in New Zealand is a very remarkable bird of the owl tribe, called the `wekau' by the natives. It is rather larger than the ordinary screech-owl, spotted with chestnut and black, and has long legs, and small green-coloured feet. The head is very small, and the beak like that of a hawk, thus imparting somewhat of an accipitrine character to this anomalous owl. It is found in the Middle Island, where its habits are, from its conformation, no doubt terrestrial. Its scientific name is <i>Sceloglaux albifacies. </i>
