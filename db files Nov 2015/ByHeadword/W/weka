Quote: The more common term used on the island for the bird [sc. <i>Gallirallus australis</i>] was the one more often used in New Zealand : weka, which features in a poetic burst from a homesick islander in 1970 writing about indigenous treats on Macquarie: When you're tired of ancient eggs for brekker / How about toasting a tasty weka?

Quote: <i>Weka, n.</i> the Maori name for the <i>Wood-hen </i>(q.v.) of New Zealand, so called from its note. There are two species South Island Weka, or Wood-hen - <i>Ocydromus australis</i>, Strick. North-Island W. or W.-h - <i>Ocydromus brachypterus</i>, Buller. The specimens intergrade to such an extent that precise limitation of species is extremely difficult, but Sir W.L. Buller set them out as these two in 1878, regarding other specimens as varieties. The birds are sometimes called <i>Weka-Rails</i>, and the Maori name of <i>Weka-pango</i> is given to the<i> Black Wood-hen (O.fuscus, </i>Du Bus.).
