Quote: A steady, hot fire was desired in order to burn all fallen timber and leaf mould, seeds, and fern spores lying dormant on the forest floor. A white ash, called a <i>white burn</i>, was the objective; a black burn resulted from a less intense fire where the heat was not sufficient to burn the timber, leaf mould, seeds, and spores on the forest floor.
