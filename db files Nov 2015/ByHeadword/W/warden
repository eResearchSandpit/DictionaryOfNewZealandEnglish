Quote: Here it seems desirable to place on record the names of the chief officers who were first appointed to the charge of the Otago Goldfields. In doing so I must premise that for some unexplained reason the title of `commissioner' was at first assigned to these gentlemen in place of that of `warden' as directed by the Goldfields Act. The proper and correct designation was however afterwards bestowed.
