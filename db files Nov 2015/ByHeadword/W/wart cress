Quote: TWIN CRESS (<i>Coronopus didymus</i>, formerly <i>Senebiera didyma</i>) is often called wart cress, but, as this name is given to at least two other species, I suggest dropping the name entirely and substituting twin cress as a good descriptive term; ... This weed is also called swine cress, hog cress, and scurvy grass [and land cress]. <i>Ibid.</i> 103 WART CRESS (<i>Coronopus squamatus</i> syn. <i>C. procumbens</i>). A more robust plant than twin cress with large wrinkled and sessile pods. '
