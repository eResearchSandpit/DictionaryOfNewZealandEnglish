Quote: [THE MUD-FISH <i>Neochanna apoda|</i> is not uncommon in the spring time in running water in the horse-shoe bends of springs and rivulets which surround Masterton, and is there called `spring eel.' Waikaka is the name by which it is known to Maoris of the Wellington Province. In other localities it is called hauhau.
