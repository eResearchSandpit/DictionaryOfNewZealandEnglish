Quote: WILLOW WEED (<i>Epilobium</i> sp[p].). - This is also called herb willow, swamp willow, and by confusion redshank and fireweed. It is a native that occasionally grows as a weed in or near ditches. The name is sometimes given to redshank [p.59], and it is true that both polygonum and epilobium grow in damp places, have willow-like leaves and are about 2 feet high.

Quote: REDSHANK (<i>Polygonum persicaria</i>) is also called persicaria, spotted persicaria, knot weed, smart weed, willow weed, and lady's thumb. Perhaps also it is this weed that on the west coast of the South Island is called water pepper or Walker's weed. It is an annual weed of gardens, crops, and wet pastures.
