Pronunciation:
Notes: NZ proprietary term. has continued strong generic usage. Jim Cameron writes: The formal word is <i>line-trimmer</i>, which I am told is also used in England, although not recorded in NSOD or Collins. <i>Weedeater</i> is proprietary but seems to be the usual informal generic name in NZ (cf customwood, gladwrap). The Australian equivalent is I believe <i>whipper-snipper</i>.
