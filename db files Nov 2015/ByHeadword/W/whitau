Quote: The whip was rawhide plaited sinnet, about six feet long, thick at the upper end, where it was fastened to a handle as long as itself, but tapering nearly to a point, to which was attached a narrow strip of rawhide, called `the fall,' finishing off with a twisted `cracker' made of `weetau' or dressed flax in [43] place of whipcord, and was a powerful flagellator in the hands of an experienced `bullock puncher.'

Quote: In Otago the general name of the [flax] plant, as a whole, is `Korari,' - or as metamorphosed by the settler, pronounced and spelt `Kouradi,' [a-macron] or `Coradi' [a-macron]. The same term is applied in the North Island equally to the whole plant, and to the dried flower-stem when cut for rafts or other purposes; or exclusively to the flower-stalk. In the North [83] Island, the Flax-plant is also known as `Harakeke,' or `Herekiakia,' - its usual name there. ... The lower part of the flower-stem is `Kaikaha;' the outer part of the leaf `Parakoka;' [a1, o-macron] the refuse of the leaf `Hunga-hunga;' the flax, dressed or not, or scraped fibre, manufactured from the leaf, `Whitau,' or `Muka.'
