Quote: Talbot Murray was to study and collect specimens of the small, whitefooted Auckland Island paua... It was possible through careful selective interbreeding of the blackfooted with the whitefooted sub-Antarctic paua, to give a fast-growing, large, white-footed shellfish more widely acceptable in the Orient.
