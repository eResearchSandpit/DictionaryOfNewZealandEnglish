Quote: Yeah, he's a woopcacker all right. A hard shot only needs to be a little unusual to be a woopcacker, though <i>woopcacker </i>seems to apply to things as well as people. The word illustrates the lack of standardization in these seldom written words: I would have spelt it <i>wopcacker</i>. Baker records the word as <i>whopcacker</i> but gives a slightly variant meaning, as `very good', `bonzer', `snitcher', `rumptydooler', and the many synonyms of these words.
