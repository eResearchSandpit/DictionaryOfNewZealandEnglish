Quote: The Warehou is a southern fish becoming less plentiful in the North Island. It is known as the Trevally, and sold under this name, in Dunedin and Christchurch. It is an excellent food fish, and is always in good demand. It is also found in Australia where it is known as the `Whario' a corruption of the Maori name Wharehou, and in Tasmania it is sold as `Snogtail' Trevally.
