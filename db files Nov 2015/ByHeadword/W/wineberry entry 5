It goes by different names in different districts. In Otago, it is the New Zealand Currant, or Moko-mok'. In Canterbury, it is called the Wine-berry. In the North Island, it is the Mako-mako.

Quote: Morris's reference to wineberry seems to suggest that it is a name for tutu, and he suggests further that <i>tutu</i> is especially a South Island word. This is not correct. My father was cutting wineberry on his North Island farm when Morris's dictionary was still quite new and he also knew tutu, but he has not heard the two associated.
