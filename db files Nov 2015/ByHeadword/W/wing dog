Quote: RICHARDS A Pioneer's Life 26 Once the mob is on the move the header and wing dog will control the lead and flank while the huntaway will watch the rear, often without a single command. 85 The 'wing dog' and huntaway also play an important and intelligent role on any drive. The wing dog is ever on the alert and watching for any sheep that may try to stray from the mob by following a track or climbing a bank.
