Quote: Up to the 30th November 1925, the Forest Service, in its capacity as organizing and controlling agent, collected and paid out the bonus upon 17.227 wild pig snouts in the Wellington conservation region. Arrangements have been made whereby all persons who presented wild pig snouts for counting and payment before the 30th November 1925 .. the system of granting a bonus for the destruction of wild pigs was extended to cover a portion of the Opotoki County, with the result that 2,026 wild pig snouts were destroyed in that district.
