Quote: Amongst smaller trees and shrubs the most prominent are the horoeka(<i>Panax crassifolia</i>), and its congeners <i>Panax simplex</i> and <i>P. edgerleyi</i>, both exhibiting such excessive luxuriance as frequently to require an examination of the fruit before their identification can be determined; the rautawhiri (<i>Pittosporum tenuifolium</i>, var. <i>colensoi</i>), the kotukutuku (<i>Fuchsia excorticata</i>), the mako (<i>Aristotelia racemosa</i>), the mapau (<i>Myrsine australis</i>), the pokako (<i>Eloeocarpus hookerianus</i>), also <i>Carpodetus serratus, Myrsine divaricata</i>, both of which are abundant. The remarkable `weeping tree', <i>Myrsine montana</i>, with its crowded recurved branches and small foliage, affords a picturesque effect
