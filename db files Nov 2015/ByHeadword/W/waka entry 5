Notes: "Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a  Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations.  (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)
