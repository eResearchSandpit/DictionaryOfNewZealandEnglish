Notes: ca1940 at least traditional children's rhyme version of Old King Cole Old King Cole was a merry old soul/ And a merry old soul was he;/ He called for a light in the middle of the night/ To go to the W.C../ The wind blew round the W. door/ The candle had a fit;/ Old King Cole fell down the hole/ And came up covered in [shit] sweet violets; violets for ladies: Covered all over from head to toe, Covered all over with/ Sweet violets.

Quote:  `You've only got one w. at your place,' said Miriam scornfully. `We've got two at ours. One for men and one for ladies. The one for men hasn't got a seat.'
