Quote: `Wayleggo!' A strange word, its origin is somewhat obscure. It is a command a shepherd gives to call his dog off sheep, and is presumably an abbreviation of `come away and let them go'.

Quote: I love the clean brown tussock/ And the hills where the cool winds blow./ It is my prayer/ I may still be there/ When the Lord calls 'Way're le' go,/ [fn] The shepherd command to a dog who has completed the job: `Away here. Let go.'/ Wareleggo is the musterers' call to a dog to come back and I believe it's supposed to be a sort of portmanteaux [sic] word made up of `Way-here-let-go,' meaning let go the sheep and come away here. Rather far-fetched perhaps but I know of no other explanation. The word is so characteristic that Peter Newton - the author of two books by a high-country musterer about high-country life - used it as a title to epitomise the spirit of his first book.

Quote: ) It is music in the chill mountain dawn to hear the musterer start his dogs on their long, hard day's work with a lusty cry that sounds `Awailago", with all the cadence on the second `a". One man told me this was Gaelic, but when I asked a Scot he said it was more likely to be a corruption of an original exhortation such as `Away and let her go."
