Quote:  ... the trappers brought [for collection for freezing] on pack-horse their `catch' [of rabbits] of the previous night, slit down the belly line, freed of inside then legged to hamstring and hock, linked in pairs hung on a roughly improvised trestle, over which hessian kept the rays of the sun from contamination. This `underground mutton' was taken to a depot, frozen, then carted to railhead, then to the wharves, and exported to Britain, where ... a ready market was always assured for New Zealand rabbit.
