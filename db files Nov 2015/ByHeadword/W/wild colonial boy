Quote: Ingenuity the war correspondents called it. Like the bloke who looted a three-toned horn from an Ite garage and fitted it to his stores truck. And sounded it majestically through the narrow streets of the Castelraimondo. Toodle-ay-eh. A wild colonial boy. The irrepressible she'll-be-right New Zealander.
