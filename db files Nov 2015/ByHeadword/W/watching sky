Quote: <i>Watching sky</i> is another interesting term for being in the <i>pound</i>; this refers humorously to the view of the sky as seen through the mesh top of the solitary confinement cell, which is contrasted with being able to watch the Sky television channels. As there is no television in the cell, 'sky' is the only thing an inmate can watch.
