Quote: Many students in those days would have worked in the wool stores stretching along Thorndon Quay. Wool stores too have gone the way of the Moa. Those who worked in the wool stores will remember the standard structure was a three-storied building with the middle floor used for sorting wool and being labout intensive. The top floor was used for displaying wool at wool sales to mainly overseas buyers. The ground floor was generally used for storage.
