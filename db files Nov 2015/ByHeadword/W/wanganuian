Quote: Since the early years of the Geological Survey, when Hutton advocated a Wanganuian age for the "Great Glacier Period" and when Hector classed some Wanganuian beds as Pleistocene, it has been customary to draw the Pliocene - Pleistocene boundary between the top of the Castelcliffian Stage (Wanganui Series) and the overlying Hawera Series. . . .
