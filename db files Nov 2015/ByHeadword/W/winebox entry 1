Notes: The term arose when about Sep/Oct 1992 Mr Stephen Lunn of Auckland put some documents into a cardboard winebox and then released them to the public. The term winebox inquiry was first used of the Parliamentary Select Subcommittee on Finance & Expenditure when it began looking into the matter and was later transferred to the Davidson High Court (Cook Islands) Commission. When faced with a court writ on publication, the Independent ran a fable on a mythical country called [South] Wogistan in which the basic details were revealed. The term Wogistan is said by the Independent in last week's issue in a column by Chalkie (? Berryman) to have gained some currency in circles interested in the Winebox affair and may be worth picking up - I have the references. It's very PC. The first published use of the term wine box of documents may have been made by Paul East in Parliament [NZPD, p. 539]

He photographed them, placed one set in a cardboard wine box, and, one Saturday, left them on the dining room table of an apartment DavidLloyd then owned in Westminster Court.
