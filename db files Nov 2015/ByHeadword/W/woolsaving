Quote: Hawera Star July 12. 2 Woolsaving. A trial has been made of the Potter's woolsaving machine, in the presence of a number of commercial men, and stock owners from the southern provinces. It is claimed that the wool on leaving the machine and being dried, is there ready for the English manufacturer.
