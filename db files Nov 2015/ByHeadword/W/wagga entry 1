Quote: Another important part of the swaggy's equipment was his bedroll. Generally it was called a `wagga'. Now the old wagga was popular in the wintertime - a bit heavy to carry, but it came into its own in the winter. The wagga rug was made out of the old one-striper sacks... The old one-striper was the fair-dinkum chaff sack, because of course at that time oats and chaff were still used a lot for horsefeed... The old heavy one-striper made a wonderful wagga.The wagga originated over on the Aussie side, and generally to improve it you opened up two sacks, and this made a wonderful rug.
