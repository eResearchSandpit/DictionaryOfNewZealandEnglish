Quote: Meanwhile the shorn fleeces are carried to a large table in the wool-shed by a man appropriately named `Fleecy', and are spread out by four wool-pickers, who tear away the bad parts and fold the fleeces square, passing them to the classer, who, in turn, after a rapid examination hands them on to his attendant, and he places them in their respective bins according to their quality.
