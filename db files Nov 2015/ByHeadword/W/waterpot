Quote: <i>Woolshed terms.</i>-The <i>water pot </i>is a tin of water (usually disinfected) which a shearer has tied by him to wet his shears in. To <i>gap</i> shears is to make (accidentally) a g. in the edge. <i>Sweat rag:</i> kept by the shearer to wipe his brow. <i>To grind</i> (shears) is always used without the noun. A shearer never `grinds his shears.' <i>Moccasins</i> are the sacking slippers which most shearers make to work in. Unless the owner of the station is a careful, observant man, he will hardly recognise his own wool pack tops.
