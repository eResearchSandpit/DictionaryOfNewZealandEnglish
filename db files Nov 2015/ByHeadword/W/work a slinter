Quote: Other unusual words are explained in the text, except perhaps one or two which are in almost universal use in New Zealand ... Finally there is `slinter' which alone presented the editor with any difficulty. To `work a slinter' apparently is - to utilize alien idiom - to `pull a fast one'

Quote: It was Brixton's habit - talking to himself, a long monologue which reproduced the slang of forty years ago. Sometimes in the company of somebody younger he might for a change talk it out loud, tell about some bloke he had a snitcher on, some joker who would work a slinter if you didn't watch out - or he might start poking borax.
