Quote: Water-race companies often made their fortunes more easily than the miners ... From January 11 to March 11 1870, the miners of Naseby went on strike, and finally induced the `water-squatters' to lower their rates from five pounds a `Hogburn' head, to two pounds. [fn] A `Hogburn' head was the stream of water which would run through a box seventeen inches wide by one inch in depth with five pounds of pressure. - J.J.T., Otago Daily Times, July 25, 1932.
