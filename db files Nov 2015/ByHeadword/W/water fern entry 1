Quote: Take, for example, the water fern, Azolla rubra, which is so common on stagnant pools and slowly-moving streams. Certainly at the first glance there is nothing about it that even remotely resembles a fern.

Quote: The plain fact of the matter is that <i>Azolla rubra</i> is a floating water fern (retoreto), native to New Zealand, which covers the surface of still waters in both islands. It is partial to a pond, it puts up with a bog, a swamp, any kind of water that doesn't move an inch... Or to the Wairarapa, where the water fern gives its bizarre red-carpet treatment to kahikatea swamps.
