Quote: Willie away, they called it ... As the ball left the threequarter's arm, all aspects of the straightforward, the normal, the usual, departed. Galvanic energy possessed various players. The Number 4 began running along the back of the lineout. The halfback of the day kept pace with him. Other forwards, 2, 3 and 5, tailed after him. Number 6 or number 7 tensed and poised and made ready to spring into the air to touch, tap or grab and pass the ball down into the arms of the first runner. And within seconds, the whole pack was shambling in his wake into the the [sic] open field, ... This was `Willie Away', a favourite ploy of the 1963-64 All Black Rugby Union team from New Zealand while they were on tour of the British Isles, France and British Columbia between October 1963 and the end of February 1964. The name came from the captain, Wilson James Whinerary, who was the principal instrument in it ... .

Quote: I didn't think I'd had an especially good game although I did do the Willie Away move a few times. <i> Ibid.</i> 291 In 1961 the `Willie Away' move was born. It was inspired by the French touring team who, although they lost all three tests, had Whineray's men sweating at Eden Park ... `The French kept peeling off the rear of the lineout and driving up the middle of the field. ... we thought if we could create a blindside by driving up midfield from a lineout ... we could extend the move where it kept dying out with France.'
