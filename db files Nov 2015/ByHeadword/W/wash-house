Notes: Jim Cameron writes: <i>Wash-house</i> is defined in NSOD as an outhouse or room where domestic washing is done. Collins tags it as <i>formerly</i> a building or outhouse. In NZ the wash-house was located in the backyard but later often off the back porch or otherwise attached to the house. It was often used as storeroom also (Cf. <i>Hot October</i> p.7.) Subsequently it came fully into the house and was rechristened laundry. But the term is still extant in the old sense, and not uncommon. ?NZ certainly much used until recently.
