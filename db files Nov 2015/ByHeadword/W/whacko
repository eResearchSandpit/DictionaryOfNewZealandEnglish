Notes: I cannot remember hearing it before 1941 and then from schoolboys at St Patrick's College, Silverstream, often in the extended form whacko-the-diddle-o! It was not used in Havelock in the 1930s. In 1953 a US Fullbright exchange student thought it `peculiarly and humorously New Zealand'. -->1951 14 M 10 Wellington H.S. 18 WHACKO (WACKO) GEORGE -->1951 14 M 10 Wellington H.S. 18 WHACKO -->1951 14 M 14 St Bede's, Chch 18 WHACKO (WACKO) [M14 6] -->1953 15 M A25 Thames DHS 18 W(H)ACKO [delight; good things M15-16 20] --->1960 16C F B2 Hawera Tech, C. 18 WHACKO -->1960 16C F B5 Wellington Girls C. 18 WHACKO -->1960 17C F B10 Napier Girls H.S. 18 WHACKO ->1984 16 F E7 Pakuranga Coll. 4 WHACKO [something liked F16 3]
