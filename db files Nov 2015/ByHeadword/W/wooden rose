Quote: <i>DACTYLANTHUS TAYLORI.</i> About 1850 Rev. Richard Taylor discovered this strange plant near Hikurangi ... A common practice is to remove the whole rhizome by boiling and scraping, so displaying the fluted end of the root, the so-called `wooden rose'.

Quote: Although the Canterbury Museum no longer houses a botanical collection, it still has a box of those rather bizarre botanical specimens known as `wood flowers' or `wooden roses' retained for their curiosity rather than their scientific value. Wooden roses are the deformed roots of trees or shrubs, the deformation being caused by the attack of another plant, the root-parasite, Dactylanthus taylori. It is found most abundantly on the volcanic plateau in the centre of the North Island, but also in other parts of the same island.
