Quote: The yellow-eyed penguin filled a niche after the Waitaha became extinct after the arrival of Polynesians between 1300 and 1500AD .. The Waitaha penguin is believed to have been closely related to the yellow-eyed penguin, but smaller. It was named after the Waitaha iwi, an early South Island people, lost through marriage and conquest. Waitaha penguin bones were found from Nelson to Southland.
