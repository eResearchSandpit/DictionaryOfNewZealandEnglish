Quote: WAREHOU <i> Seriolella brama </i> (Gunther) In Otago, commercial and sport fishermen, auctioneers, retailers, consumers of fish and readers generally have for many years been giving the name Trevally (<i> Usacaranx lutescens </i>) to small Warehou up to twelve inches in length. It is to be hoped that this misnomer will continue to be replaced by the proper name of Warehou.
