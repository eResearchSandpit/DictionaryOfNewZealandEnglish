Quote: <i>widdygiddy</i> to behave in a flighty manner; another of the `widdy' words Stevan Eldred-Grigg came across in researching pre-WWII Christchurch working class families. Partridge identifies `widdy' as either a widow or the gallows in dialect and low colloquial C19, the latter Scots, possibly a pun on `widdy', a halter. however, the juvenile or even baby talk of fanciful adults seems more likely.
