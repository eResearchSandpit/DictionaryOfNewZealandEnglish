Quote: Another time-honoured practice [in Central Otago] is `Waterlooing'. That is done by getting up a little earlier in the morning, figuratively and literally, than the legitimate rabbiter and going over the poison lines where the carcases lie, not yet cold, and skinning them. -->(cp BANDICOOTING)
