We .. hereby record our opinion, that the process of Dumping Wool Bales, previous to stowage, is not in any way injurious to the Wool, and that the sale of the same is not in the slightest degree prejudiced by the said process, provided that no excessive force be applied, and that the pressing be effected with due regard to the original packing of the bales, whether vertical or horizontal.
