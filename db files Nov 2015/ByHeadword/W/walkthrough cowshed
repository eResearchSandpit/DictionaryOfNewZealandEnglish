Quote: When the cow was milked her leg was released and a long pole handle opened a door in front of the cow and she walked out into a concrete race. The door was pulled shut, the chain removed and the next cow came in. This was known as the 'Walk Through Shed' and was superior to the type where the cows were backed out.
