Quote: Mr Thomas Pratt, who represents the Southern Maori District in the New Zealand Parliament, informs me that the word `ferro' in Mr Palmer's statement (p. 2) should be written `wherro' - though pronounced `fherro' - the `wh' being always pronounced as `fh' in the Maori tongue. Thus Kawhia in the North Island is pronounced `Kafhia,' and so in all instanced, The meaning of the word is `red,' or is more generally used to indicate anything brightly coloured.`Simon' - the word used by Mr Archibald - is probably a corruption of `timata,' strongly accenting the `i.' It means `heavy' - and in this connection, `heavy stones.'
