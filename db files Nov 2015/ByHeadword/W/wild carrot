Quote: There are also several <i>grasses</i>, as well as <i>wild carrots, turnips</i>, and <i>cabbages,</i> whose origin, from their similarity to ours, may be attributed to the visits of some European shipping: and a <i>sowthistle </i>grows very luxuriantly wherever the forest has been recently felled, affording nourishing fodder for pigs, horses, and cattle.

Quote: WILD CARROT (<i>Daucus carota</i>) is common in fields and waste places in scattered localities. It is annual or biennial, with a distinct white tap root only faintly suggestive of its cultivated descendant. It grows 1 to 2 feet high, and the leaves and flowers are like those of an ordinary carrot.
