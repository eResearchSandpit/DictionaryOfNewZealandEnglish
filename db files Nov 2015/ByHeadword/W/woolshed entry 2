Quote: He had seen sheep shorn at home, but he had never beheld such a scene as the shed at Waitaruna. The shed, a large building of corrugated iron, was surrounded outside by innumerable pens, most of them crowded with sheep packed as close as they could stand. Inside, the woolshed was also filled with penned sheep, except at the end where the wool-press stood, and along each side, where space was left for the shearers.
