Quote: Later, traction engines [for threshing] ... had their own galley and cook, and it was a great sight to see engine, mill, water-cart and dog box - a two wheeled hut. The boss and Water Joey slept near the machinery to be handy to get up steam in the morning, and then get the cookshop going.

Quote: In many areas, the most difficult job was to organise a water supply for the [traction] engines. ... Natural water supplies had to be exploited and as these often had very difficult access the life of a `water joey' was no bed of roses. <i>Ibid.</i> 148 The usual gang for stack threshing [c1900] was 12 men. The boss kept steam up and attended to the mill adjustments and lubrication, three men worked in the bag hole, the bag-rammer, the bag-sower, and the bag-carrier; two men were on top of the mill, a band cutter and a man to turn the sheaves to the band cutter: two men were on the stack forking to the `turner', and then there was the chaffy, two men on the straw stack, a builder and a straw `walloper' and last of all, the water joey. Threshing out of the stock required an even larger gang, usually about three more men.

Quote: "Where's that blasted water-joey? Me boilers are nearly dry."... One thing about the young water-joeys. they didn't dash off to the boozer, but they were irresponsible little devils... <i>Ibid.</i> 2 The water-joey's first job in the morning was to catch the draught-horse, yoke it to a dray which carried a 200-gallon square water-truck, then drive to the nearest water-race or pond and fill the tank by hand-pump.
