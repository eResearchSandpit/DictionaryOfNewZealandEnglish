Quote: Michael Cullen: [..Nine years ago, when Helen Clark was absent on overseas leave, I rose in this House on the second reading of the Employment Contracts Bill and committed the Labour Party to repealing the Employment Contracts Act. And we will repeal the Employments Contracts Act. Eat that! You lost, we won, it goes! It was as simple as that.]
