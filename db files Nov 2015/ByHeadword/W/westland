Quote: `West Coast' continued to be used in the 1860's, but after 1864 the official names, `West Canterbury' and `Nelson South West', had some popular currency. Then a further complication was introduced. In 1859 John Rochfort had had coined the name `West land', a shortened form of `Westmoreland', the name he used on a map showing his West Coast explorations. After August 1865 the form `Westland' was resurrected and was used both for electoral and judicial districts which covered part or whole of the West Coast. Popularly, however, `Westland' was used chiefly for West Canterbury; the remainder of Canterbury Province was sometimes called `Eastland'. West Canterbury became the County of Westland in 1868 and the Province of Westland five years later. The Nelson South-West Goldfield kept this official name until 1876 when the provinces were abolished.

Quote: `West Coast' remains the popular term for the strip of country on the wrong side of the Southern Alps, though recently New Zealand geographers have adopted `Westland' for the whole West Coast. Whatever its merits, this term is unsatisfactory. It has some popular currency south of Greymouth, and it may acquire popularity through its teaching in the schools; but at an indefinable point north of Greymouth one is likely to be told, `This isn't Westland, this is the Buller'. A region itself so distinctive is also marked by strong local feeling. In 1960 `Westland' celebrated its centenary; `the Buller' did not.
