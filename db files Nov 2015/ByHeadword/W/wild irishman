Quote: In this condition [<i> Rubus australis </i> , Forst.] forms one of the most ... troublesome `Lawyers,' or `Supple-Jacks,' of the forest. It is known to the settler also as the `Wild Irishman,' and to the North Island Maori as `Tataramoa'. [fn] A term defined by Dieffenbach as `Thorns, Blackberry,' - a description at least partly applicable, and with greater propriety, to <i> Discaria Toumatou. </i>
Notes: (Lindsay has confused <i> Lawyer </i>  (? and Supplejack) with Matagouri or Wild Irishman
