Quote: Similar plantlets are produced by the walking fern (<i>Asplenium flabellifolium</i>). In this species, the frond usually produces a single bulbil at the very tip, so that when it arches over and touches the soil, the bulbil roots and grows out into a new plant. This growth habit makes it an excellent subject for a hanging basket.
