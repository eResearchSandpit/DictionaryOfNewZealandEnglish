Quote: Yet ... there is a tension, what we call whakamaa." No, it doesn't mean shamefaced, not exactly. "More of a sense that, '<i>Crikey</i>, we made a mistake.'"

Quote: The concept and meaning of whakamaa are difficult to explain concisely in English. However, the word is generally translated to mean one of these three things shy, embarrassed, or ashamed... Whakamaa most often occurs for Maori people, either as individuals or as members of a group, when they are placed in a situation where they perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage and thus to have a lower status. Whakamaa, therefore, has a lot to do with mana, which is most often translated by Maori people to mean power or authority... Third, utu or making amends requires restoring a person's or group's mana. Metge concludes that whakamaa will continue until a person or group is re-integrated with and placed in their proper position within a community.

Quote: He shifts into galvanising-leader mode, exhorting membership drives, slamming recent government publicity "about-turns" on Maori policy, dismissing the planned 2005 hui tamata (Maori economic summit) as little more than a government publicity stunt, stressing the need to validate Maori knowledge and "take New Zealand with us. We have to do as we preach; we have to help them get over the whakama [embarassment] of saying 'Papatoetoe' [correctly] in front of their friends ... We will Maori-ise New Zealand. ..."
