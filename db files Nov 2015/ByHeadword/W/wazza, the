Quote: Colonel Malone noted the incident cryptically in his diary: April3. Riot in Cairo last night. Some of the Australians and New Zealanders wrecked some brothels where they had been badly treated. If they had burnt the quarter down it would have ben a good thing. This was the so-called `Battle of the Wazza', named for the street in which the attack took place: the Haret el Wasser near Shepheards Hotel. In this quarter on Good Friday 1915, several hundred Australians and New Zealanders sacked and set fire to the brothels while thousands more watched.
