Quote: Then the diary goes on to duly chronicle the daily round of life aboard, one uncommon thing noted being the old sailoring custom, now a thing of the past, of `working off a dead horse.' The name is derived from the fact that in those days a sailor had a month's wages advanced to him before leaving Port. As he invariably spent it, he called the first four weeks at sea `working off a dead horse', and the end of the term was signalised by the heaving overboard, with muchceremony, of an effigy of the defunct equine.

Quote: The passing of the first month [at sea in the  Westminster in 1842] brought the sailors' ceremony of `burying the dead horse'. When engaged, the men received one month's pay in advance to enable them to outfit themselves. Few would have much left, so for the first month they felt themselves to be working for nothing, or `working a dead horse' which must now be buried.  An equine effigy was placed on a wooden frame with four wheels, and amid loud singing was drawn around the deck three times by sailors dressed as policemen bearing staves of sailcloth filled with straw, hats of the same material and whiskers and long wigs of white yarn. The `horse' was put up for auction (the money being for liquor afterwards) and was then hoisted to the main yard-arm mounted by a sailor, during another chorus. Duly hoisted with this ceremony the `horse' was set alight by a long squib, the rope was cut, and the `poor oldman' (as the song went) fell into the sea. Thus was the dead horse buried. [Possibly from William Harris's MS Journal of a voyage; or John Newland diary from 1841.]

Quote: .. `dead horse' should have been in because the time that had to be worked off for an advance pay not only meant a lot to the sailors coming out here, but was transferred to our mining life to signify the overburden which had to be stripped before paydirt could be reached.

Quote: We are not going to deny it, but we should like to point out that we have been working off our dead horse during the past five years of unostentatious advance. According to Mr Stead, we have reduced the debt per head during the last four years very considerably, until it now stands at L54 15s 11d per head.
