Another fish of the cod kind, which has a deeper body than the <i> Lotella rhacinus </i> , and more delicate flesh, resembling that of the whiting. It is abundant on the west coast of Otago, where specimens are caught with the hook, in 15 fathoms water, at the entrance to Dusky Bay, weighing about 5lb.
