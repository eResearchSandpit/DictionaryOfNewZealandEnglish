Quote:  <i>CLAIMS </i>Worthless claims or ground were called schicers or duffers. Those yielding up to [pounds]3 per week per man were known as `tucker' claims; up to [pounds]8 per week were known as `wages' claims; above [pounds]8 were known as `pilers'; the richest of all were known as `Home-ward-bounders.'

Quote: It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access.

Quote: The workings which but the other day were swarming with life and industry now by comparison appear almost deserted;  small wages claims are scornfully rejected, and even shareholders in the rich ground, in the last stage of the disease, have engaged wages men to work during their absence, and started with the rest for the Southern Dorado.

Quote: It was well known from the beginning that the lead was only payable, or at best the claims, would be what are known as wages claims but from the magnitude of the preparations made by the holders of some of the claims, strangers were lead [sic] to believe that the fortunate possessors of them had untold wealth at their command.

Quote: At a meeting of creditors of the Hauraki North G.M. Company held yesterday it was agreed that four months time should be given the Company to enable calls to be made and collected, wages claims to be treated as preferential, and general creditors to be paid in instalments pro rata as the money comes to hand.

Quote: These causes of delay might be borne with more patience if the diggings were somewhat richer than any of those hitherto opened in this part of the country, but on tucker, or small wages ground, people do not bear such disappointments with a very remarkable degree of christian [sic] fortitude.
