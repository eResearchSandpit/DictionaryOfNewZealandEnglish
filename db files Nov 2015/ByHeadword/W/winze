Quote: <i>Winze</i>: A small-section shaft sunk by working downwards from the level, using a hand-held jackhammer-drill. A compressed-air-operated winch was mounted on a platform at the top and a bucket used to remove the spoil, which was tipped from the platform into a truck. The men took turn about excavating in the winze and driving the hoist. The main hazards were: the danger of the bucket or a piece of rock falling; premature explosion while a man was climbing out of the winze; or drilling into an unexploded charge. Ventilation was supplied to the winze by a venturi and ducts.
