Quote: Whakapapa is a comprehensible paradigm of reality which traces the origin of the universe, the genesis of gods, the creation of woman, the rise of the legendary heroes who established cultural norms and social institutions, the ancestors who migrated from Hawaiki to New Zealand and the heroic ancestors who demarcated tribal territory and established tribal polities which remained extant into historic times. Whakapapa were used to validate tribal mana and claims to the land, functions which were properly recognised by the Native Land Court.
