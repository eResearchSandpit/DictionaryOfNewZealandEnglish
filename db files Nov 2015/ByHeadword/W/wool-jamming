Quote: Captain Shortland personally supervised the stowing [of the wool cargo c1880s-1890s] `screwing' the bales into the hold to the singing of sea-shanties. The bales were stowed by hand until the last in each row when `screw-jacks' were used, based on `samson posts', to screw the last bale of the tier into position. ... This method of stowing wool was sometimes referred to as `wool-jamming' or `screwing'.

Quote: As a matter of fact, a further little loan from "Bull and Co." is projected, and although the majority of these golden sovs. will doubtless be frittered through the broad sewer of party politics, we adopt the "laissez-faire" and go on cow-pumping, wool-jamming, and meat canning, and comfort ourselves by saying that we are alive.
