Quote: Fishermen on some West Coast rivers speak of "Dan-Doolin spawn" or "whalefeed"... Although whitebaiters know them by the name "whalefeed" they are in fact the young of several species of freshwater bully: the redfinned bully (<i>Gobiomorphus huttoni</i>), the bluegilled bully (<i>Gobiomorphus hubbsi</i>) and the common bully (<i>Gobiomorphus cotidianus</i>).
