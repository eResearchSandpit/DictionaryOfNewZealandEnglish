Notes: My thoughts were that the word sounds Scottish (willy-wombles etc)  (or Scottish via Newfoundland whalers) but it doesn't turn up in any Scottish or Newfoundland Dictionary I have seen. Then whaling possibilities suggest New England but have found nothing so far. Another thought was Caribbean dictionaries (because of whaling there) but nothing turned up. One of your cits suggests Patagonian but no Patagonian dictionaries around. Meteorological dictionaries ignore it although they touch on willy-willy. Otherwise, it is just one of their unspecified "local winds". However, the attached dictionary entry seems to have a lot of sense, particularly the statement that it was common 18th Century oral nautical usage, to which can be added "preserved in some of these localities where these winds occur. dhurley		11/25/1999

(Note: willy-waw - funnelof fine seaspray sucked up by a gale orsquall and blown willy-nilly).
