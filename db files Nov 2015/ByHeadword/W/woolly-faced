Quote: J of Ag Oct 15. 366 .. woolly-faced ewes (which have more wool on the face and head relative to the main fleece area) gave fewer lambs, had a lower twinning rate, had a lower body weight, and were more difficult to get in lamb than open-faced ewes. At first sight it appeared that the production differences between open and woolly-faced sheep may be aimply due to wool blindness. Growth rate of woolly-faced lambs appeared to fall behind that of open-faced lambs in adverse weather.
