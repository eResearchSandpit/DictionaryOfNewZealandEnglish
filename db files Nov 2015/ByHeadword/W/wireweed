Quote: A little lower down where the seaweeds are permanently submerged we have such plants as the GRAPELET, the WIRE- WEED, and OX-TONGUE; the FLAP-JACK and GIRDLE WEEDS. In rather deeper water ... we have the (<i>Lessonia</i>) and the OARWEED, the GRAPEWEED, and numerous representatives of the red algae.
