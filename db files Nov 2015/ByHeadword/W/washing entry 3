Quote: Washing consisted of two separate operations, the first of which was called `soaking'. The soak was a sort of bath ... let into the ground beside a creek ... It was filled and kept full by water flowing in through a two-inch pipe and a supply of boiling water was kept handy ... Soap and sometimes ammonia were added to it. After the sheep were let out of the soak they were driven ... [to] the creek ... tipped in ... and washed clean by men standing in the water.
