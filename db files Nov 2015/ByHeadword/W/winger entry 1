Quote: At this stage it might not be out of place to mention that wing-forwards were played for the first time in 1876 [the year Canterbury sent a touring team as far as Auckland]. Thus early the `winger', who was to cause a great deal of controversy in later years, was much in evidence.

Quote: No treatise on forwards can be complete without a reference to `wingers'. ... the scrum's Satanic wings ... [Long ago elderly gentlemen] went to see the old-fashioned `wingers'. Their joy was like the thrill of the alleged Spaniard, who watched a game in the heyday of `wingerism' : `Caramba! eet ees splendida! Eet ees to me your bonsa or bosca.'
