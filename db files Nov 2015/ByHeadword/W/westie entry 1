Quote: Petrol heads, bogans, and gruffs - these names mean one thing to west Auckland comedian Ewen Gilmour : "westies". Gilmour believes westies live all over the country. No matter where they live they share a love of tight black jeans, the smell of burning rubber and the feel of a leather jacket. Being a westie is about lifestyle, not location.

Quote: After all, this is a film about Westies, written and directed by a Westie, designed to put the Westie play-hard go-hard subculture up on the screen. I suspect this is a sanitised version of the real thing, but there's still enough here to appeal to the Westie in all of us. (Go on, indulge your inner hoon.)

Quote: Aucklanders have erroneously labelled the bogan as the "Westie", failing to appreciate that Westies have been thriving in the provinces far south of the Bombay Hills for much longer than they have occupied West Auckland... "You know you're a bogan when you come home on your 15th birthday and your dad says, 'Okay son, it's time I gave you a talk about the facts of life' and you go 'Okay, Dad, hang on, I'll just put my kids to bed...'"

Quote: The mullet, sometimes pronounced "moo-lay", is the signature cut of Westie males. They are members of a great tribe that ranges across the Anglo-Saxon world: there are comrade Westies in Wanganui, munters in Masterton, bogan hordes in the Hutt Valley,; there are yobbies and Westies in Australia, crackers and trailer trash in the US and chavs, slappers and Essex girls in the UK.
