Quote: Conformity was the [University hostel] House Code. A room mate was always a wife, trousers were always reamers, old boy was always pronounced air bair, the board at the bottom of the bed was the power board, a shower was a soak, all other hostels were inhabited by morons, freshers answered the phone.
