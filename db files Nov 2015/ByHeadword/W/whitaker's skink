Quote: At first glance the food mass in the weasel's stomach appeared blackish with numerous tiny yellow flecks. This proved to be the remains of a juvenile Whitaker's skink, which made up about 70% of the stomach contents. The rest of the stomach's contents were comprised of the remains of a juvenile brown skink Leiolopisma zelandicum and three tiny invertebrates (a spider, an isopod and a fly) that may have come from the skinks' stomachs.
