Notes: [P at get on one's wick equates it with <i>Hampton Wick</i> = prick] esp. in (mainly schoolboys', and esp. in imper.) FLICK ONE'S WICK, (to) hurry up!; wake up! --Possibly derives from a fuller threat `I'll flick your wick for you if you don't hurry up, wake yourself up, get out of my way, etc.', from the painful prank of flicking a boy on the point of the penis with a wet towel
