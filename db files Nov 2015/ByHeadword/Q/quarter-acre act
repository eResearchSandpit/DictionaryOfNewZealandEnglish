Quote: In some rural areas it was the custom to allow the teacher to keep a cow and a horse, which further extended the normal playground space (e.g., 1875, in Tahataki). It was only in the towns, and at a much later date in rural areas, that the effects of the `quarter-acre act' were felt. [fn] The quarter-acre was the space to be given over to the playground in public schools.
