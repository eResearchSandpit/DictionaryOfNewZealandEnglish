Quote: The geological map of the Waikato area (Fig.1) is part of a new national series known as QMAP (Quarter-million Map; Nathan 1993), produced by the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Ltd (GNS). ... For the AMAP series, rock units are shown primarily in terms of their age of deposition, eruption or intrusion.  ... The QMAP series uses computer methods to store, mannipulate and present topographic and geological information.
