Quote: Who's going to employ queens? The majority of Wellingtonians know what most street queens do for a living... The Health Department provides funds for the prostitutes collective's work in Aids prevention but Khann feels the street queens get only the crumbs... "But then I found if a client was looking for a queen he'd go for a queen and if he was looking for a girl he'd go with a girl."
