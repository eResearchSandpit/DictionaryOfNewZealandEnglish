Notes: 1969 Coastal Development. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Auckland on 29th and 30th August, 1969. It is in this, in a paper by J.D. O'Brien, Commissioner of Crown Lands, that the information about Cass decreeing there should be a chain in 1851 is first stated to my knowledge. Haven't tracked down the original proclamation or by-law by Cass].

Quote: [Hdg] The Queen's Chain (Not a limpwrist ornament). <i>Ibid.</i>  15. In manyplaces in New Zealand the Queen's Chain,as the coastal reserve became knownbecause of its nominal width, has beenthe foundation of coastal landsubdivision, but in others it has not...The fault lies not in the laws but inourselves that we have crowded the coast,and the Queen's Chain concept is asappropriate right now to the new idealismof environmental management as it was tothe nineteenth century problems of landgrabbing, coastal shipping by sail, rivercommunication, and lack of roads.

Quote: The Queen's Chain is a colloquial term for all the above forms of public reservation, nominally one chain or 20 metres wide, and comprises the accumulative, if inadequate, legacy of official action to implement Queen Victoria's instructions of 1840... Extension to riverbeds and beaches of the Queen's Chain founding principle that river banks and coastal margins shall be free from "disposition" to private interests is essential; otherwise they are liable to be literally sold from under the public foot.

Quote: Access along all our water margins is a myth. It has been estimated that a Queen's Chain exists only on about 60 per cent of our significant rivers, lake shores and coastline. The term describes a legal variety of strips of land along water margins that are held in public ownership. These include marginal strips, roads (whether formed or not) and esplanade reserves.

Quote: Largely unfettered and unhindered access around and along margins of the sea and waterways - commonly thought of by the public as "the Queen's Chain" - is dear to the hearts of most New Zealanders. <i>Ibid.</i> Changes proposed under the bill will put barriers in the way of.. creating a comprehensive "Queen's Chain" system throughout New Zealand.

Quote: Finlay Macdonald and Grahame Anderson.. completely miss the problem of the mythical Queen's Chain. In 1840 Queen Victoria instructed Governor Hobson to "set aside for recreation and amusement ... on the sea coast or in the neighbourhood of navigable streams ... reserves" - and "we do strictly enjoin and require you that you do not on any account, or on any pretence whatsoever, grant, convey or demise to any person or persons any of the lands specified as fit to be reserved as aforesesaid, nor permit or suffer any such lands to be occupied by any private person for any private purposes". This admirable instruction was not adopted until the 1892 Land Act, by which time much land adjoining riverbeds and the coast had been taken up. Since then.. the few lengths where the Queen's Chain was set aside are now in the riverbeds or out to sea, because they were fixed on survey plans and not moveable.
