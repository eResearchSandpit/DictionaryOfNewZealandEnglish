Quote: In November [1852] I visited the diggings [at Thames], and procured the frog which is herewithsent. [221] It was got in this way. The gold-diggers were washing the soil of a mountain-stream in the machine called `long-tom'. In excavating the banks they displaced several large boulders of quartzy rock, underneath which was discovered the living frog.
