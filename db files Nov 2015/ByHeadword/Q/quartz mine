Quote: This is the case in all alluvial diggings, and very soon unless new ground is found at the creek, diggings in New Zealand will be done up and they will have to form companies to work the quartz. Already they have two quartz mines on the Nevis which are paying tolerably well, and ...there will be many more soon.
