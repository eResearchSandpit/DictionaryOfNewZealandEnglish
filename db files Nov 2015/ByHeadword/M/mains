Quote:  Cock fighting was a favoured sport on the goldfields and some very gallant birds were bred for this old English pastime. At Marsden, a secluded mining township in the bush some distance from Kumara, many cock fights were fought and a lot of money changed hands over the fate of these fights called `mains.' One of the cockers gave my father a beautiful white cock, his comb dubbed, trimmed and fighting fit. <i>Ibid.</i> 348 The clamorous challenges of the old English game cocks melted the hearts of some of the committee-men but cock fights were not part of the popularity of the [Greymouth] Poultry Show and mains did not materialise
