Quote:  The manuka blight was first introduced into the [Hawkes Bay] region in 1945 ... [fn] The blight is caused by the action of a small sucking insect which feeds on the sap of the manuka and which secretes large quantities of a clear sticky substance known as `honey-dew'. A black sooty mould forms on this secretion. A combination of sap loss and mould slowly kills the plant.
