Quote:  Manaaki - this term is of special goodwill. It refers to acts of kindness, hospitality and goodwill. It is related to the term `mana', and refers to a person's finer qualities rather than what a person has in terms of material goods. If a Maori shows warmth, respect and kindness to people, they are showing manaakitanga. The most humble homes can show this quality as much as wealthy homes - it is giving from the heart.

Quote:  Trainee Kaitohutohu Himiona Herbert approaches his career work with a strong Maori perspective. He says his dealings with Maori clients are based on the concept of manaakitanga - welcoming people in and making them feel at home with the same sense of warmth and connection that they would encounter on a marae.
