Quote:  Then all of a sudden, thanks to the web, we had, briefly, a plethora of media criticism including the mysterious Mediacow which, it proclaimed, was "prowling media bull in Aotearoa/New Zealand". ... It went on: "Mediacow works in the media in New Zealand and uses this newly created weblog to give one perspective on the state of journalism in our country. Mediacow is a social and economic liberal."
