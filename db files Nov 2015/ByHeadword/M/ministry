Definition:In New Zealand until quite recently (Ministry of Works, 19 ), only the former of the two main `governmental' senses of Ministry was commonly used: OED 5 from 1710, the body of ministers forming the government' eg. the Seddon ministry, etc. As the name of a Stare department (OED 6, from 1877) it was introduced when the name of the `Public Works Department (see P.W.D.) was for various reasons changed to Ministry of Works. Since then the reorganisation and extension of responsibilities of the Transport Department has given a new Ministry of Transport. -->`Ministry' is felt to be a more inclusive (perhaps grander) name than `department' in the NZ State Services system. (Based partly on a note by R. Mason) -->cf EWD 5.
