Quote:  Then in 1937 he published an essay called `The Maruiwi myth'. This was concerned largely with the first part of the legend of the coming of the Maori - `that the first Polynesian settlers who arrived with Toi ... found the North Island - possibly both islands - inhabited by a non-Polynesian race, known as Maruiwi or Mouriuri, whom they subsequently exterminated; a small remnant alone escaping to colonize the Chatham Islands'.

Quote:  This passage embodies an early version of what has become known as the `Moriori myth'. Except for the name Moriori, which was borrowed from the Chatham Islands and applied by 1880 to supposed pre-Maori inhabitants of New Zealand, the theory is all here in a book published in 1877, based on material collected in the mid-1860s. A black-skinned, curly-headed people with timid dispositions, presumably negroid or Melanesian, were supposed to have been found in possession of New Zealand by the first Polynesian settlers and exterminated by them except for a few with whom they intermarried, so that their racial traits appeared from time to time among the Maoris.
