Quote:  During Victorian times Ranunculus lyalli, the Mt Cook or Mountain Buttercup, was known in England as the "Rockwood Lily."... The exact connection between the "Rockwood Lily" and a Canterbury sheep station presents an interesting puzzle... Rockwood Station, owned by Henry Phillips, was one of the earliest established homesteads... However, the precise connection with Rockwood.. has yet to be discovered.
