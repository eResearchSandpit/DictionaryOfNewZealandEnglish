Quote:  Skin colour and the mixture of blood which is responsible for it [sc. high visibility in a white world] are often commented on by one Maori to another. The terms `mongrel', `black mongrel', `dago', or `black nigger', for instance, are often used by Maoris either in referring to themselves or to other Maoris in the neighbourhood. Thus one informant, in introducing herself, remarked: `I'm only a mongrel' - meaning only a mixed-blood Maori.

Quote:   `We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.' In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings. (i) A dog of mixed blood.  Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise. (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal. `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.) `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.)

Quote:  The trouble with me wasn't so much that I was poor as that I was half Maori. I was just a bloody mongrel to some of them. <i>Ibid.</i> 51 `Going off with Martha like that. I ought to sock you one. I'll clock you, you bloody mongrel!'
