Quote:  The Moeraki boulders are an assemblage of near-perfect spheres that lie like discarded cricket balls on an east Otago beach. The largest of them span more than two metres in diameter and weigh over seven tonnes.[15] Claims have been made that the Moeraki boulders are the only rocks of their kind in the world... The truth is that concretions are common, but are usually only a few centimetres in diameter, irregular in shape and unlikely to impress... To Moeraki's Ngai Tahi residents, the boulders' origin is intertwined with the arrival of kumara from distant Hawaiki. According to Te Rungana o Moeraki, the great waka Arai-Te-Uru was wrecked during a fierce storm at Matakaea (Shag Point), just south of Moeraki. The boulders are food baskets that washed ashore after being thrown overboard to lighten the load. The Katiki concretions are said to be kumara tubers and seeds from the same wreck.
