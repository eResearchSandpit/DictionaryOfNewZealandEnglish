Quote:  We have, if you like, extended the myth of what the New Zealand character is. The man alone battling against nature, facing banks, and the expertise with a piece of No 8 wire.

Quote:  The narrative voice in Stephen Sinclair's first novel is a familiar one, one that has appeared in "man alone" novels from John Mulgan's landmark book that gave the genre its name in 1939 to Owen Marshall's <i>Harlequin Rex</i> last year.

Quote:  "Mulgan's only novel was a remarkably mature evocation of God's own country going to the dogs in the post-World War I decades. Its iconic reputation as a book that celebrates rugged individualism and self-sufficiency is in potent conflict with the socialistic implications of its title that derives from Ernest Hemingway's statement in <i>To Have and Have Not</i> that 'a man alone ain't got no bloody f---ing chance'." - Peter Simpson

Quote:  For Mackenzie, this isolation may have been from necessity, but it was his ability to deal with this aloneness that enabled him to access this landscape like no other settler of his time. In fact, Mackenzie's story may have been the foundation of the "man alone" genre that still permeates New Zealand film and literature to this day.

Quote:  It would probably take a scholarly thesis, however, to examine the way that Crump first popularised, then personified and finally parodied the Man Alone myth that has run though this country's literature like a strand of No. 8 wire... "The notion of the Man Alone figure goes way back to the 19th century and to a certain extent it occurs in Australian writing as well; so he comes out of a long tradition, really... The coup de grace was the Toyota ad campaign of the 80s and 90s in which Man Alone tackled the wilderness in a Japanese car.

Quote:  Against the triumphalism of the New Zealand narrative as the "Man Alone" story, a Puritan hangover, Robin Hyde is emerging as the ghost-writer in the sky, retrospectively altering New Zealand literary history, not so much as "Woman Alone", although she was that, but as a communal writer; one writing to include the dispossessed, the outcast, one writing against the dominant paradigm.

Quote:  Could he do something about the title, as <i>Talking of War</i>, just a the moment, seemed that bit too ambiguous. "In consultation with my chief reader," Kerby wrote, "and bearing in mind the fact that Hitler is master of Europe, [192] what did he think of either 'A man Alone', or 'Escape from Death'? The editor felt the former was the one to go for. ... The title Muligan settled on for the novel has at times been remarkably misread. In his own country, the phrase 'man alone' became a glib response to what is supposed to define an aspect of national maleness, what Orsman's <i>Dictionary of New Zealand English,/i> designates 'a type (or stereotype) of the independent outdoors New Zealander.' It is as though the novel is assumed to celebrate Johnson's raw struggle with land and society, and that Muligan proposed that experience as asdmirably defining.
