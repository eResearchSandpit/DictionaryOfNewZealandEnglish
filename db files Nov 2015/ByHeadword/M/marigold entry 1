Quote:  The most graphic description would fail to give any adequate idea ... of the purity and charm of these Alpine Flowers [sc the white <i>R. Lyalli</i>] growing ... side by side with the yellow Mountain Lily (<i>R. Godleyanus</i>), and interspersed with Alpine marygolds (<i>Senecios</i>) and the little star-like <i>Montias</i>.
