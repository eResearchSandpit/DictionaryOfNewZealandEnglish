Quote:   MUSK <i>(M[imulus] moschatus)</i>, called also scented musk, is a small creeping, hairy-leaved, often scented yellow-flowered species, often forming masses a yard or so across, in damp places or on stream beds. [There is, or was, a scented form, which forty years ago was commonly grown as a window plant. It is said to have disappeared].
