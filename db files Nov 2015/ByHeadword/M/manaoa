Quote:  The open pumice land is covered with a tangled mass of manuka and manaoa, with tussock on the colder flats. In developing pumice country a great saving can be effected in clearing costs if the manuka and manaoa scrub are burnt standing two or three years ahead of cultivation. Dense manaoa scrub is difficult and costly to clear in its green state, but it carries a fire well and its burnt stubs soon rot.
