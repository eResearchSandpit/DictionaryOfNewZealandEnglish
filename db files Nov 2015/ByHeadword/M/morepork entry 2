Quote:  The name at least, if not the appearance, of the morepork ... is well-known throughout the colony[OEDS country]. Australian settlers distinguish a podargus by a similar name, whence the colonial epithet (whether of Australian or New Zealand origin is uncertain) applied to a dawdling person, who is often described as `a regular old morepork'
