Quote:  Mauri - ethos, life-force or principle, life-style, belief. This term applies to both animate an inanimate things. Houses, land, trees, forests, buildings, hills etc. can have a life-force of their own. So can the front (atea) of a marae, a speech, the kumara, or the taniwha of a river. Maoris strongly believe in mauri, and just as a life force may wax or wane depending on a person's health or status, so can his or her `mauri'. Lack of mauri can cause a person to die.

Quote:  If a Maori is genuinely disturbed, in Maori terms, the answer again is to restore their mauri (life force), as for physical illness. This is particularly true for <i>mate</i> Maori, Maori sickness, which arises from spiritual and social causes, not physical ones (Pakehas would call it psychosomatic).

Quote:  We've all heard of the Life Force, the mysterious energy or divine light which illuminates and enlivens the soul and gets Luke Skywalker out of trouble... In China it goes under the name Chi, in Japan as Ki, in India as Prana, in French-speaking countries as Elan Vital and among Maori it's called Mauri.
