Quote:  I have to record ... a trace of human life on this island ... reaching back beyond history, and supporting the Maori tradition that this island was inhabited before their arrival here, and that the Maeros [fn For an account of Maeros and Ngatimamaeros, see Hochstetter's `New Zealand,' page 210.] of the North Island and the Ngatimamaeros of the South Island, may yet be found to be real aborigines, and not degenerate wild Maoris, as has been supposed by many.
