This I take to be the bird which is sometimes called the sheerwater, or the sooty petrel - a black bird about the size of a duck, with long wings, which all of us have seen on our voyage out skimming over the waves. In the month of December these birds resort to the cky islands about Foveaux's Straits in great numbers, for the purpose of breeding.

Quote:  MUTTONBIRD. Also known as the sooty shearwater or titi, the New Zealand muttonbird is <i>Puffinus griseus</i> and belongs to the order of sea birds known as petrels. As a name, `muttonbird' appears to have originated among early European settlers in Australasia and is said to refer to the taste of the flesh. At least as probable is the theory that the name refers to the rather woolly appearance of the downy young. In New Zealand other petrels are also given the name `muttonbird'. In fact, the sooty shearwater, which is most abundant on the islands about Foveaux Strait, might well be called the <i>southern</i> muttonbird, and the grey-faced petrel, predominant on the islands off the coast of Auckland Province,the <i>northern</i> muttonbird. In Victoria, Tasmania, Bass Strait, and South Australia, the species is the short-tailed shearwater - an occasional visitor to New Zealand seas.

The titis, attracted by the light, fly by in great number, and are knocked down as quickly as possible; thus in one night several hundreds are often killed, which they preserve in their own fat for future use.'
