Quote:  Mechanised inspection also permits several ewes and lambs to be transported to the home environs where the job of mothering-on may receive closer attention. Another mothering-on method where fences are at a premium is to screw or drive auger-shaped fence standards into the ground to which the ewe may be tied.
