Quote:  .. the Department of Agriculture had stated that whilst it had in view a scheme for the certification of Akaroa seed, it was not yet prepared to declare Banks Peninsula a 'Mother Seed' producing area. 77 Banks Peninsula was ideally suited for the purpose of certification, and the whole district would be treated as a Mother Seed producing area with suggested boundaries from Little River to Mount Herbert and all east of that line.
