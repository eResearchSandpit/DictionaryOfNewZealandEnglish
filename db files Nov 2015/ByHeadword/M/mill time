Quote:   Some [saw]mill terms have died out. One is <i>mill time.</i> This was a setting of the clocks an hour early so that the working day, eight to five by mill time, was really seven to four. It was a kind of localized summer time to allow the saw sharpeners to work in daylight after working hours.
