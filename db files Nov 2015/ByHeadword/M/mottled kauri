Quote:  Mottled totara is as much esteemed for cabinet work as mottled kauri. Some of the largest and soundest kauri timber has richly mottled shading, which appears to be an abnormal growth, due to the bark being entangled in the ligneous growth, causing shaded parts, broad and narrow, according as the timber is cut relative to their planes. This makes a rich and valuable furniture wood, and in the market is known as `mottled kauri'.
