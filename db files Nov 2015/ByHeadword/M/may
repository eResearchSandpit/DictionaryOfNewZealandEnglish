Definition:OED, <i>Crataegus Oxyacantha</i> blossoms of the hawthorn; hence occas the tree itself : so called becouse it blooms in the mouth of May. The word is inappropriate to NZ seasons, so

<i>hawthorn</i> is used exclusively. <i>Hawthorn</i> bushes themselves are relatively uncommon, and the term is often (mistakenly) extended to include <i>barberry. </i>
