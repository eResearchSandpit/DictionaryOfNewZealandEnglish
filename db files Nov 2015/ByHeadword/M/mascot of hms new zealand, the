Quote:  <i>MASCOT OF H.M.S. NEW ZEALAND, THE</i>: The Maori `Piu-piu,' or cloak of black and white strips of flax and feathers, and the carved greenstone amulet figure, ("Tiki") worn round the neck (similar to the old battle insignia of Maori chiefs) presented to the battleship

<i>New Zealand</i>. They were given by an old Maori Chief in 1913, with the injunction that they must always be worn when the ship was in action, the chief prophesying that they would keep the ship from harm. Both "Piu-piu' and `Tiki' were worn at the Battle of Jutland by the Captain - to the great satisfaction of the crew, who, it is told, before the battle began took special measures to find out that the Captain was actually wearing the ship's mascot. On another occasion, when an action seemed imminent, the <i>New Zealand</i> mascot was also worn. On that occasion, word was specially passed round the decks among the men - `It's all right, he's got 'em on!' The <i>New Zealand</i> at Jutland escaped with only one shell hit, and had no casualties. Writing home after Jutland an officer said: "This ship bore a charmed life and suffered to the smallest extent though we were right in it the whole time.'
