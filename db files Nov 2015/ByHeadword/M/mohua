Quote:  Since the rediscovery of mohua on the mountain in 1985, their numbers had painstakingly been built up from six to 90. But because ship-rat numbers built up over winter and rats moved for the first time into the mohua breeding zone, the result was a crash of the fragile population back to a critical level.
