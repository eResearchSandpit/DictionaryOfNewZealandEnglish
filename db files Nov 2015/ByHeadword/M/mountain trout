Quote:  <i>Mountain-Trout, n.</i> species of <i>Galaxias</i>, small cylindrical fishes inhabiting the colder rivers of Australasia, Southern Chile, Magellan Straits and the Falkland Islands. On account of the distribution of these fish and of other forms of animals, it has beeen suggested that in a remote geological period the area of land above the level of the sea in the antarctic regions must have been sufficiently extended to admit of some kind of continuity across the whole width of the Pacific between the southern extremities of South America and Australia.

Quote:   Koukoupara - is a fish like the kokopu, but differently marked, and following the example of one of his informants, the translator [sc Beattie] has translated this as `mountain trout'. Koukoupara is the spelling adopted in the lists, but the [Maori] compilers have varied this with kopara, koupara, and kokaupara. Never once do they use the southern form of kokopara, which the southerners pronounced kokobala, which the early settlers soon turned into `cockabully'.

Quote:  KOKOPU <i>Galaxias fasciatus</i> Gray. It is often called Mountain [115] Trout but it is also found practically at sea level, just above high- tide mark, as I have often caught specimens in small creeks near the sea at Portobello, in Otago Harbour.

Quote:  They offered to kill a pig, but I preferred the lake fish, of which there is but one sort, being a description of small speckled mountain trout, similar to that met with in the streams of Van Dieman's Land; about eight inches long, of a very delicate flavour, and making most excellent soup.
