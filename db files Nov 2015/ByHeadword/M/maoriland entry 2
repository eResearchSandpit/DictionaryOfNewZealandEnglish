Quote:   ... it was ... from the deck of a small trading schooner ... that I first cast eyes on Maori land.

It <i>was</i> Maori land then; but, alas! what is it now? Success to you, O King of Waikato. May your<i> mana</i> never be less! <i>Ibid.</i> (vii) 105 There were in the old times two great institutions, which reigned with iron rod in Maori land - the <i>Tapu</i> and the <i>Muru</i>. Pakehas who knew no better called the <i>muru</i> simply `robbery', because the word <i>Muru</i>, in its common signification, means to plunder. But I speak of the regular legalized and established system of plundering as penalty for offences, which in a rough way resembled our law by which a man is obliged to pay `damages'.
