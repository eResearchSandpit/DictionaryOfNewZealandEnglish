Quote:  Possessing excellent powers of mimicry, and useful to the natives as a decoy-bird, the kaka is much sought after, and almost every native village has its `mokai'. <i>Ibid.</i> 89 \{1888 2nd edn 1/96\} I had been addressing a large meeting of natives in the Whare-runanga, or Council-house [at Rangitikei], on a matter of considerable political importance, and had been urging my views with all the earnestness that the subject demanded: immediately on the conclusion of my speech, and before the old chief, to whom my arguments were chiefly [sic] addressed, had time to reply, a Tui, whose netted cage hung to a rafter overhead, responded, in a clear emphatic way, `Tito!' (false). The circumstances naturally caused much merriment among my audience, and quite upset the gravity of the venerable old chief Nepia Taratoa. `Friend,' said he, laughing, `your arguments are very good; but my <i>mokai</i> is a very wise bird, and he is not yet convinced.'
