Quote:  Brash promotes National as a mainstream party in contrast to Labour, which stands for minorities and rampant political correctness. ... At this point, "mainstream" seems to be an almost infinitely flexible political principle, big enough to include respectable prostitutes and wealthy former bankers who know the price of bread (but not, incidentally, of milk).

Quote:  Broadly, National's mainstream is that of the "We're all one" New Zealander who, according to Brash, wants to work hard and get ahead." Labour's mainstream, says Cabinet Minister Steve Maharey, comprises those who "want a vibrant, diverse New Zealand culture" and who value "tolerance and inclusion".
