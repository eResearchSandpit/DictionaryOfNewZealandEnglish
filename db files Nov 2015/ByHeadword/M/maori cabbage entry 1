Quote:  Interestingly, in the subantarctic the same plant [sc. Macquarie cabbage, <i>Stilbocarpa polaris</i>] has another name, Maori cabbage, which in New Zealand English means especially the sow thistle (Maori puha), and certainly not the subantarctic plant. 'Maori' here probably had the sense of 'growing wild, non-domesticated.. and was applied to the <i>Stilbocarpa</i> by early Macquarie residents.
