Pits had been dug to obtain sand and gravel, which, after having the larger stones removed, were spread over the natural loam top soil to render it more suitable for the cultivation of the kumara ... <i>Ibid.</i> 28 The <i>taniko </i>in the embroidered borders of cloaks, is from the point of technique the latest development in Maori weaving.
