Quote:  <i> [Suttonia australis (The Red Matipo)</i>] ... Native name <i>Mapau, Mapou,</i> or <i>

Matipo</i>. The name Matipo is generally applied by Europeans to <i>Pittosporum tenuifolium,</i> but this is apparently the plant to which the Maoris attached it. This tree bears some resemblance to <i>Pittosporum tenuifolium,</i> but can be readily distinguished by the reddish colour of the leaves. [<i>Rapanea Urvillei</i>, 1907]

Quote:  This species is largely used for the formation of ornamental hedges and is then called the `Matipo.' This is a misomer, as the Maories apparently applied this name to a species of <i>Suttonia. P. Tenuifolium</i> was called by them the <i>Tawhiwhi </i>or <i>Kohuhu.</i>

Quote:  <i>matipou</i>, a tree (Myrsine Urvillei), commonly mispronounced matipo, the `o' with the non-Maori sound of the English diphthongal `o'; the Maori `o' is the sound of `awe' or matapo: the Maori shortening of he word is mapou.

Quote:  Sir, - Your gardening correspondent (September 21) recommends two native trees which he calls `Lemon Matipo' and `Black-stemmed Matipo'.... The only true Matipo has red stems and is also named Mapou (Myrsine australis). Pittosporum eugenioides I have always known as Lemonwood or Tarata; P. Tenuifolium is properly called Kohuhu.
