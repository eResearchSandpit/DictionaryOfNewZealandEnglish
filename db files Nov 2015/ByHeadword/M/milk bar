Notes:  Once when she couldn't have me Dad let me go to the flicks by myself. He gave me some extra money, so I went to the milkbar and bought a gobstopper and some other lollies. I stuffed my face, and felt crook all the way home. He bought new footy boots for my eldest brother too, and an Art Union ticket for Mum. He must have had a beaut time up the RSA that day, I reckon.

Quote:  During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city.

At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'.
