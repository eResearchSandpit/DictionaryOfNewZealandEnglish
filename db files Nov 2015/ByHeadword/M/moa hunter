Quote:  In this way [Haast] justified his idea that New Zealand had been peopled by two races of men - one, the Moa-hunters of the Palaeolithic period, crude in their mode of living and uncultured in their arts; the other, men of the Neolithic period, who displayed a great advance in domestic economy ... but who knew nothing of the Moa, which had disappeared long before their arrival. This pronouncement was made in 1871.

Quote:  THE [AUTHOR'S] USE OF THE TERM MOA-HUNTER [heading] [XII] ... Because this hunting economy and imported artifact styles coincided with the then unknown period of the extermination of the Moa in particular, Skinner, Duff and Buck revived the term Moa-hunter Maori to distinguish the first phase of ecological adaptation from the climax Classic Maori phase of the eighteenth century, with such new elements as agriculture, the fortified village, warfare, and artifact styles evolved within New Zealand. [XII] The term Moa-hunter follows the practice in culture-phase designation of coining a label of contrast. Although Moa-hunter Maoris gathered shell-fish and hunted all available birds, fish, seals and small whales, the cultural and economic phase is conveniently designated from the Moa as the largest and most spectacular game animal available during man's first adaptation to the environment and the one no longer available in the Classic Maori era. The term Moa-hunter is preferred here to the longer `Archaic Phase of New Zealand East Polynesian', too easily corrupted to `Archaic Maori', with `Archaic' meaning only `early'.
