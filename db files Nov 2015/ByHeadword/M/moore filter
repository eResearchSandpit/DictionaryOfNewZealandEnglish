Quote:  <i>Moore filters</i>: Large `baskets' of canvas-covered filter-frames weighing about 16 tons and connected to a vacuum
Source. First the basket was lowered by an overhead electric-crane into a tank of thickened pulp, previously treated with cyanide solution for several days. The vacuum caused a layer or cake of slime one or two inches thick to build up on the frames, while the clean solution, now laden with gold and silver, was pumped to the precipitators. When the cake reached the required thickness the basket was lifted and placed in a tank of barren cyanide solution, which was sucked through the cake removing the residual gold-bearing solution. After this the basket was placed in a `wash water' tank to remove all the solution, and then it was lifted and placed over the discharge bay; the vacuum was then released, allowing the cake to fall off (with some encouragement from a wooden scraper) into a waste sluice. [328] This process was repeated at about two-hourly intervals, with several bays working at the same time.
