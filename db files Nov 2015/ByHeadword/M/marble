Quote:  `Reverend Mother talks of when she used to give you marbles for being a good little boy - pee-wees and agates, and stonies and glassies and a big tor. And once she tried to play with you, and you said she funked because her knuckle was inside the ring.'

Quote:  Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.
