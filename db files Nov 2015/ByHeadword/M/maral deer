Quote:  Jee Hansen's maral deer are a damn nuisance at feeding out time, he says.... When he tows a trailer-load of hay into the paddock, the marals will jump on to it... The marals are still a relatively rare sight in New Zealand. They are a type of red deer originating from the Caucasus mountains in Russia and are specially prized for their calm temperament. The New Zealand marals all stem from one hind imported 15 years ago.
