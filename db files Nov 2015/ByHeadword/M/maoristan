Quote:  If it were possible or desirable for Maori people.. to .. live on a reservation, "homeland" or "Bantustan", they could, of course, run their own schools, hospitals, police and courts... The "Maoristan" would have to be subsidised by the general taxpayer, reducing the people who lived there to colourful pets.
