Quote:  Undoubtedly there was good blood among these horses, though the great majority would come into the somewhat elastic classification of `Maori weed.' In actual fact, there was no reproach in the term, Born and reared on the inhospitable plains, a horse developed a stamina that no finely-bred animal possessed. Well broken in and handled properly, a `weed' would get through more hard toiling in a day than the average equine would put behind him in a week. Looks might be against him, but for downright hard work in the high hill country he had the goods, as they say, and with something to spare.
