Quote:  Health issues of special concern to older Pacific people are discussed at fono held twice a year in Christchurch. The last fono...attracted over 50 people, including 33 older Pacific people (matua). ... Matua heard that the population of Pacific peoples is different from other ethnic groups in New Zealand because more than 50 per cent is aged less than 25 years.
