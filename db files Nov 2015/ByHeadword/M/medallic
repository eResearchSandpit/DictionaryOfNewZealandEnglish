Quote:  But we've never had medallic recognition from the New Zealand for our services [in Korea]... A spokesman for Mr Burton said that under the Government's Medallic Principles, the Imperial Award was considered to be a New Zealand award because it was awarded by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of New Zealand, shortly after her coronation.
