Quote:  Maori used as an adjective synonymous with <i>native </i>except that it seems slightly contemptuous. We admire native bush, pasture or game; but Maori hens (woodhens), Maori cabbage [European cabbage run wild, A Wall] and Maori onion (Chrysobactron hookeri] are caricatures of their English namesales.
