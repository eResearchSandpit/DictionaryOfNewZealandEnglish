Quote:  One ride on a Suzuki T.F. 125 Mud Bug and you'll feel right at home. The reason being that the Mud Bug will feel right at home on your farm. The Kiwi breeding is obvious in the Mud Bug's ingenious work-easier features .. Little did Kiwi farmers realise when they helped Suzuki design the original Mud Bug that they were creating a legend.
