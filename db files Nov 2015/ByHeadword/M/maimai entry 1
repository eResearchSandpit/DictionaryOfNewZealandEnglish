Quote:  ... at the junction of the Huranui [Canterbury] with the waters of the lake, we found a diminutive wharry or grass hut, just big enough for four persons to crawl into and pack close; near this was a `mi-mi', or shelter of a different description, to be used as a safe repository for flour and other necessaries, besides paper or any articles that might attract rats.

Quote:  MAIMAI. - Possibly the name for an old sheep station, although I have not been able to trace one with that name. `Maimai' is, however, the name for an out of way hut; there was one on the Dunstan Range many years ago and another is on Benmore Station.
