Quote:  Among the Bills to be introduced by the Government is one for the establishment of a Maori village settlement under the perpetual lease system.   A small rental will be charged, and stringent conditions as to occupancy will be enforced.   The right of transfer will be limited to other Natives, and all precautions will be taken to prevent a transfer to Europeans.   The system will be applied especially to the South Island Natives, many of whom are said to be almost homeless.   The Government will buy the land necessary for the settlement.
