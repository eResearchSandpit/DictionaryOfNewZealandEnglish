Quote:  These [skate's] eggs are passed off in horny, oblong capsules and are known to fishermen and others as Skate Barrows, Sailors' Purses, Mermaid's Purses and Mermaid's Pinboxes, and are often picked up on the shore after storms. Each capsule contains one egg. The shape is like a miniature pillow, with four horns (one at each corner).
