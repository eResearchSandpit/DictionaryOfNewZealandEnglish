Quote:  My objection was this, June and July being mid winter and the road being in its Maori state, we could not depend on getting in to Ahuriri or Auckland on the fixed day, and that a bad commencement would bring up a bad report on the line of road.

Quote:  <i>Maori</i> .... [in] its slightly contemptuous adjectival use, as in <i>a Maori dog, a Maori garden, Maori manners</i>. Here the term is employed to signify something unkempt, rather disordered or wild, something a little `uncivilized'.

Quote:  Again, the word Maori for these [Otaki] people has taken on a secondary meaning when it is used as an adjective referring to any object that is broken, dilapidated, hard to use, or about which people are so casual that it does not function efficiently. Thus a `Maori' door is one on which the catch is broken or which fits so badly that it blows open in the wind. ... A `Maori' gate is always a weird contraption made of bits of wire, string, parts of an old iron bedstead - something so complicated that it defies the ingenuity of the non-expert either to open or close. The owner of the gate jokes about his `Maori' gate. He is rarely sufficiently concerned ever to make a simple workable gate.

Quote:  `Where you from?' ... `Up country. Taranaki say'. `Do you have to make your own tracks to get there?' `Just about.' `Same up home. I'm East Coast.' [218] They kidded each other in a way that would have been offensive with <i>pakehas</i>. When Shirley put a cigarette-butt down the sink ... Netta would say, `That's a real Maori trick, that one! Real East Coast!'
