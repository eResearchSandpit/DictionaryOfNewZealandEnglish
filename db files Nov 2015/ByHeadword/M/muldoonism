Quote:  They [cool TV newsreaders] were symbols of a benign paternalism that paraded the daily doses of murder, mayhem and Muldoonism past us and wordlessly reassured us: `There, there, it won't really hurt you. ...' Whatever did happen to that old comfortable world; has it all been Rogernomicised out of existence? Happily no. What we used to call social justice and now term wimpishness still lives.

Quote:  Under his tutelage New Zealand learned to live beyond its means as it had never done before, to such an extent that nobody seems to know quite how large its total foreign debt has become, except that it is certainly huge and may be a per capita world record. Its welfare state, which has often been held up as an example to the world, was allowed to swell as its traditional and all-important agricultural markets shrank. As the budget deficit widened, Sir Robert became an apparently immovable fixture, the political Mr Micawber of the southern hemisphere. Now the voters have awoken to the unreal nature of what long since became known to them as `Muldoonism', its creator and chief exponent could not bring himself to accept his stinging defeat, like many another unseated authoritarian before him.

Quote:  In the meantime the word `strong' needs urgently to be redefined. For the majority of men - and increasing number of women - it is at present simply Muldoonism brought into the sphere of personal and professional relations. Deny your most [119] tender feelings, destroy those who reveal themselves as vulnerable or sensitive, put down the opposition like dogs, polarise everybody in sight, create plausible scapegoats, ... and hate ... with all the venom you can muster.
