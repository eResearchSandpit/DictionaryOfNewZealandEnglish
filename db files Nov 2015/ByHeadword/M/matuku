Quote:  matuku, two birds, 1, Botaurus poeciloptilus, bittern, and 2, Demigretta sacra, blue-heron; the Maori distinguished these two according to their habitat: 1, matuku-hurepo (swamp matuku) and 2, matuku-moana (sea-matuku). When the Pakeha mentions the matuku he always refers to the bittern; the other he always calls blue-heron.
