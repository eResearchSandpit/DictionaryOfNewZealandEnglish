Notes: There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.

The term <i>hapu</i> (pregnancy) was used to denote this expanded family group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors ... The term<i> iwi</i> (bone) was brought into current use to include all the<i> hapu</i> descended from common ancestors and thus related to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the <i>iwi</i> has been termed tribe and the <i>hapu</i> a sub-tribe.

Quote:  Before the arrival of strangers from overseas among the warring tribes, the inhabitants of New Zealand were Atiawa or Ngapuhi or Waikato. So far as is known, they had no name for their race: the word <i>maori </i>meant normal'. They applied the term to themselves only when, for the first time in their recollection, they encountered another race.

Quote:  This raises the question of what we mean by the term Maori. Why should Kupe be termed a Maori, if (according to Maori tradition) he was a Society Islands voyager of some 1,000 years ago who touched at New Zealand in the course of exploring voyages and returned to his homeland? By what greater right can we apply the term to Toi who arrived from the same part of the Pacific 200 years later to settle in New Zealand, or to the numerous voyagers subsequent to Toi and culminating in the Hawaiki Fleet of 1350? Every immigrant from tropical Polynesia did not become a Maori the moment he stepped ashore in New Zealand. The culture which we have come to know as Maori was undoubtedly the end product of a long period of local development, probably not reaching its final perfection of form until after the visit of Tasman. The use of the term Maori (lit. normal, ordinary or proper) to distinguish the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand from the intrusive European is even more clearly a late development and certainly post-European.* [fn] Williams (1921) notes no literary use before 1850 of the Maori in its present sense. Scholefield (1945) puts its use back to 1840, in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi. McNab, quoted by Shrimpton and Mulgan, without the reference being cited, states that its earliest use was in 1818.

Quote:  (Profesor Joan Metge) Recent letters opposing the use of the word `Pakeha' claim that it means `foreigner' or `stranger'. ... Whatever the word meant when it was first bestowed, it has taken on a new and special meaning. Maoris today use it to identify non-Maori New Zealanders of European and especially of British stock, people whom they recognise as having a history of residence and commitment to this country. Maoris use it not only to distinguish Pakehas from themselves but to couple them with themselves. The word has meaning only within the New Zealand context, in relation to and partnership with `Maori', the shared reference point being the land of Aotearoa/New Zealand.
