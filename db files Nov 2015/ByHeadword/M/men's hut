Quote:  The manager has a nice house; and the wood-shed, men's huts, dip, &c., are near each other.  <i>Ibid.</i> ) 34 We peeped in at the men's huts - a long, low wooden building, with two rows of `bunks' (berths, I should call them) in one compartment, and a table with forms around it in the other, and piles of tin plates and pannikins all about.

Quote:  <i>Men's hut</i>: House where the station hands live. On some stations it is called the <i>station house</i>, and now often the <i>whare</i>, which word was, I suppose, brought from the North Island stations. Originally the men cooked, ate, and slept in a one-roomed hut, with a fireplace and colonial oven at one end and bunks in two or three tiers round the walls. Nowadays most <i>m. hs.</i> are reasonably comfortable houses with separate rooms. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], under <i>hut</i>)
