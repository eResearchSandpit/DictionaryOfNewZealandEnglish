Quote:  mob: as distinct from herd or flock which, though grammatically incorrect, mean the sum total of a man's cattle or sheep, a mob means an integral part of that herd or flock. (eg held in a particular paddock.) A mob also means a collection of beasts, possibly of one or more owners, all boxed together and being driven, in which case it is never a herd or flock. When a mob of sheep or cattle is put up for sale, it is then referred to as a line.
