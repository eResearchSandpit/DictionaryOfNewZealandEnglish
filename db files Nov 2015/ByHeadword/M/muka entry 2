Quote:  The flax (<i>korari</i>,) forming the dresses is of two or [176] three kinds; the most coarse, called muka, is employed for working the common garment (<i>kakaou</i>[a1-acute] <i>maori</i>[a-acute].) This flax is also made use of for laying up ropes, lines, &c. The superior dress called Kaitaka[a2-a3-acute], is made from silken flax, <i>(hunga hunga</i>[as-acute].)

Quote:  The Korari is the name of the flower stalk, often, but wrongly, used as the name of the plant. The edible root is the Aruhe. The word `Muka' is commonly applied to the dressed fibre; it is the correct name for the inner leaves. Cleared bush-land is suitable for the cultivation of the flax plant, and even swamp-land is improved by drainage. In the various flax swamps near nelson ...the finest plants grow upon the soil that has been thrown out of the ditch ...

Quote:  The renovation of `Rangiatea' is a much bigger undertaking. ... The wall tukutuku are about 16 feet high while in the gables they run up to 30 feet. The old fellows must have put in a lot of thought to piece together such lengths against a real kakaho backing, with muka [ed fn: Prepared flax] binding to keep the whole in position. To keep the horizontals from sagging with the sheer weight of the material the muka binding was passed through holes bored into the edges of the poupou - an adaption of the rauawa technique.

Quote:  In Otago the general name of the [flax] plant, as a whole, is `Korari,' - or as metamorphosed by the settler, pronounced and spelt `Kouradi,' [a-macron] or `Coradi' [a-macron]. The same term is applied in the North Island equally to the whole plant, and to the dried flower-stem when cut for rafts or other purposes; or exclusively to the flower-stalk. In the North [83] Island, the Flax-plant is also known as `Harakeke,' or `Herekiakia,' - its usual name there. ... The lower part of the flower-stem is `Kaikaha;' the outer part of the leaf `Parakoka;' [a1, o-macron] the refuse of the leaf `Hunga-hunga;' the flax, dressed or not, or scraped fibre, manufactured from the leaf, `Whitau,' or `Muka.'
