Quote:  Another description which I have heard him give is that the mower, or rather the forage harvester, is used as a 'mechanical cow.' To be fully utilised grass has to be eaten at its most nutritious stage and the idea of this 'mechanical cow' is that the herd is grazed over the pasture at its best stage, but when growth begins to outstrip the herd, the 'mechanical cow' - the forage harvester - is brought out and run out over these paddocks.
