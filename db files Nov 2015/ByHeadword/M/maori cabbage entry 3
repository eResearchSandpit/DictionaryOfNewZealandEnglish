Quote:  <i>Maori.</i>- Used as an adjective synonymous with<i> native</i>, except that it seems slightly contemptious. We admire native bush, pasture, or game; but <i>M.</i> hens (woodhens), <i>M.</i> cabbage [the European cabbage run wild--A.W.], and <i>M.</i> onion (Chrysobactron bookeri) are caricatures of their English namesakes.

Quote:  Along some rivers [in Otago in the 1860s] Maori cabbage grew and formed a welcome addition to the meagre vegetable supplies of the earliest incomers. ... Speaking of the so-called Maori cabbage, Mr Kennard remarked: `Up along the Kawa-rua [old pronunciation of Kawarau] between Cromwell and the Gorge there was Maori cabbage on the sandbanks, a sign that the Maoris had been there. It was like rape. When T.B.Nelson had Mount Royal he sowed rape with young grass, and an enterprising man put it in Maori kits and sold it in Palmerston as Maori cabbage.

Quote:  Pora is an introduced vegetable run wild. The word `pora' means a ship. The plant flourished up the rivers, and the first settlers called it `Maori cabbage'. The lists also call it Pora-kawa-kawa, but this is amalgamating two names, for the kawakawa is another vegetable run wild.

Quote:  . ... A plant called the `Maori Cabbage'. Gathered some of the leaves for cooking. ... I believe this plant is a turnip which has degenerated for want of proper cultivation, so that the roots are too small to be of much use, but the tops are excellent boiled as greens. It is supposed to have been introduced by Captain Cook. .... Its appearance is always a sure sign that a Maori encampment has at some former time occupied the site.

Quote:  The leaves of several smaller plants were also used as vegetables [by the ancient Maoris]; but the use of these in modern times, or during the last forty or fifty years, was commonly superceded by that of the extremely useful and favourite plant - the Maori cabbage, <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, introduced by Cook (nani of the Maoris at the north, and rearea at the south), of which they carefully sowed the seeds.
