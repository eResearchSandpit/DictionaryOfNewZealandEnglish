Quote:  As you worked at the pillar - picking, shotfiring, shovelling an' that - it got thinner an' thinner until in the end it looked like a big black tornado, or a tree holding up the sky. That's why the last strand of the pillar is called a 'mahuta'. Things got very tricky at this stage, because the coal in the mahuta was amazingly easy to win; just one gentle prod with yer pick and the coal just blew out... It was tempting to have one last go at the easy stuff in the mahuta, but get it wrong and you brought the roof down on yer head.
