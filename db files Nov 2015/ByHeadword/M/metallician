Quote:  The Taieri Advocate says: It is seriously stated that there was very little tote betting at Tuapeka, the detective employed not having a single case to report. Those who were present at the meeting and saw the splendid business done by several metallicians know a little different.

Quote:  [Hdg] A Tapanui reader has sent me a recent issue of the local Courier, drawing my attention to two `Past Events' items. ... a paragraph about tote betting back in 1896, where it was stated that those attending the Tuapeka races `saw the splendid business done by several metallicians'. It's a new word to me ... [entry from <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> [John Roberts, Box 962, Dunedin] metallician 1.<i>Racing slang.</i> A bookmaker ...

1874 <i>Notten's Slang Dict. Metallician</i>, a racing bookmaker. Bookmakers use metallic books and pencils. 1887 Daily Tel. 12 Mar. 5/2 In Australia the bookmaker has to pay dearly ... As for the long-suffering Australian public, they are mulcted as heavily as the much-taxed metallician.]
