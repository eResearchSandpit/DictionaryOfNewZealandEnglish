Quote:  Desperate for something for the vase a few weeks back, I snipped off an armful of bright orange montbretias, or crocosmias, which had made themselves at home in a corner of the garden... When my mother was a child growing up in Southland, these were known as Minnie Deans, the rather gory legend being that they sprang up wherever the notorious baby farmer had buried her infant victims.
