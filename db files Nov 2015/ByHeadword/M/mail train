Quote:  The final death knell of the provincial expresses - the old 'mail trains' that ran several times a week over all secondary main lines - was sounded by the arrival in 1954 of the first of Drewry Car Co's 88-seaters, generally called 'The Fiats' because of their twin Fiat 700.040 horizontal six-cylinder diesel motors.
