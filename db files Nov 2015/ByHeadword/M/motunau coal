Quote:  Motunau Coal, Canterbury Plains, resembles that of Massacre Bay in its general character, but ignites more readily, and burns with less smoke; it contains a great quantity of sulphur but no traces of bituminous matter; its residue is composed of hard clinkers of brownish colour, and of powdery charcoal-like substance.
