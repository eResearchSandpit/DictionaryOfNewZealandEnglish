Quote:  The amendments [to the resources Management Act] elevate historic heritage to a Matter of National Importance, giving it the same recognition afforded such treasures as the coastal environment and areas of significant native flora and fauna. Anyone operating under the resources Management Act must recognise and provide for the protection of historic heritage from inappropriate subdivision, use and development.
