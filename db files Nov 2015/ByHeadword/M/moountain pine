Quote:  Of those trees which were generally to be met with, the pine was by far the most beautiful, and in height exceeded all the others beyond any degree of comparison. We observed two species of it, but the mountain-pine, called by the natives <i>cowrie</i>, which we found growing upon the sides and summits of the hills, and rising to an enormous size, was the most remarkable.
