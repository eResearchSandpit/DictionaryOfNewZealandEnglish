Quote:  In the upper levels of the mines the ore - shoots are said to have been intimately associated with what are termed `mineral heads' or `bars'. These are apparently layers of sedimentary rock, which originally proved more permeable to the circulating ground-waters than the general mass of rock, and supplied aqueous precipitants of gold and silver to the vein channels. <i>Ibid.</i> 124 A much more extensive shoot of ore was mined in former years from the intersection of a rather large mineralised stratum (`mineral head') with one of the veins
