Quote:  NEW ZEALAND MINNOW <i>Galaxias attenuatus</i> (Jenyns) ... This is the inanga of the Maori; but the term is not used in the same sense by all tribes. Some call whitebait inanga and use the term in a general sense, others apply it to the adult and others strictly to the young of the minnow which form the main constituent of whitebait, Galaxias attenuatus. Hiwi is a name used in the Bay of Plenty for the parent fish, and numerous other names have been applied to this important fish by Maoris in all parts of the country.
