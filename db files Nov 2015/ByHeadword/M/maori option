Quote:  As the next election appears on the horizon, a sense of futility is being sown in my psyche. Its source had been traced to the latest bit of political manoeuvring under the convenient title of the Maori Electoral Option... The final burlesque is when one' realises that the Maori option is provided every five years when the electoral cycle is every three years.

Quote:  Even the Dictionary of New Zealand English (DNZE) (1997) is patchy in its coverage of legal terms, having for example no entry for disputes tribunal, family protection, incorporated society, Maori option, protection order, resource consent.    The most recent edition of Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary (1995) is useful but commonly gives specialist   definitions   taken   from   the interpretation sections of statutes
