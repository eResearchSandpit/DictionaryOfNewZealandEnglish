Quote:   ... no permanent mining industry of any extent has been established in New Zealand. ... The alluvial diggings ... in Otago and West Coast can hardly with any propriety be termed mines, or those who work them, miners. For the sake of convenience, I shall, in the following essay, observe a distinction between the alluvial digger, by whom I understand one who gathers gold from the surface ;and from later deposits only, and the alluvial miner, ... that is ..., one who works the deeper deposits or deep placer mines as they are called.

Quote:  At a later date [in the 1857-9 rush] came miners (who are often confused with diggers) who would only work for wages, a thing the old digger would only do when hard up.
