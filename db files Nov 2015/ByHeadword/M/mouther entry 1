Quote:  [We] began mouthing sheep. Polhill who has bought the run and the sheep took down the mouths on paper as the sheep are to be paid for according to their ages. ... You catch a sheep in your arms, carry it to the gate where the mouther stands, hold the mouth open for him to look at and you at the same time call out two, four, six, full or whatever it may be. ... The mouther has to be very quick and catch the mouth at once and put a dot under whatever age it may come on paper. So you know the number age sex etc. of your whole mob.
