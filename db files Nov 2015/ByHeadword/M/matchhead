Notes: Kolstad says there was an entry of "matchhead moss" <i> Cladonia cristatella</i>) written but not included in Vol.3 of Dictionary of American Regional English. Kerry Carman (Sep. 2000) writes : This is a very localised Southland/Otago colloquialism for the Grape Hyacinth <i>Muscari armeniacum</i>. The only literary reference I can give you, apart from Frame, is from Invercargill writer Olive Dunn's <i>Delights of Colour in a New Zealand Garden </i>p. 16. Other Southern writers such as Essie Summers also use the term I am told but I can not supply a reference. The origin remains a mystery but it may stem from the old blue topped wax Vesta matches. Dianne Bardsley says she knew the term well from the Wairarapa, but it is not known in Taranaki.
