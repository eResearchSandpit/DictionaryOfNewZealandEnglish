Quote:  Old Calamity was an early one-man band of fiddle, horn, cymbals and kettledrums. Gambling was poker of 45s, a diggers' card game from California involving legs, queer suits and Maggie, cries of `Get Jinx!' and `Go for the Doctor!'

Quote:  In smoky little back parlours [in Westport] friendly little groups meet to play `forty-fives' with uproarious oaths and much heavy thumping of the table. For [100] the uninitiated it may be stated that in this game the <i>five-fingers</i> (the five of the trump suit) beats all other cards. The trump suit order is five, jack, ace, king queen - all other suits begin with the king. Non-trump suits win high in red; low in black. Obviously the ace of diamonds is the lowest card in the pack unless diamonds are trumps, in which case it is the fourth best. The word "obviously' in the preceding sentence is a little optimistic - as the ace of hearts (the Maggy) is always the third best trump. It is credibly reported (a) that the game is of Irish origin (b) that there are no written rules (c) that the game can only be learned by playing it, and (d) it is as charactistic of Westport as whitebait or coal.
