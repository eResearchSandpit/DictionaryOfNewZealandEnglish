Quote:  The New Zealanders are very religious men. Their priests lead them out to a quiet spot where they can pray. The priest spreads out a holy mat with marks on it which means something they have great faith in. He kneels down beside the mat, then a row of worshippers kneel all round him, with another row bending over them, and another row standing behind them. The worshippers throw their offerings on to the holy mat, and the priest places two coins on a short piece of polished wood which he calls a kip, and raising his eyes to the sky, he throws up the coins as an offering to Allah. All the worshippers raise their eyes also to the sky, and then bow solemnly over the mat, and say together, `God Almighty', and the priest answers, `A pair of Micks', which means that the offerings are not accepted, or he may say, `Oh Lord, he has done 'em again', and the joyful cries of some of the worshippers show that Allah is pleased, and so they, too, are glad.
