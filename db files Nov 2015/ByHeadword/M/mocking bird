Quote:  The most remarkable bird is one to which Cook's people gave the name of mocking-bird, from the extraordinary variety of its notes. There is also another which is called by the English the poe, or poi bird, from a little tuft of white curled feathers which it has under its throat, and which seemed to them to resemble certain white flowers worn as ornaments by the people of otaheite, and known there [188] by a similar name.
