Quote:  <i>Mopoke, n.</i> aboriginal name for an Australian bird, from its note `Mopoke.' There is emphasis on the first syllable, but much more on the second. Settlers very early attempted to give an English shape and sense to this name. The attempt took two forms, ` <i>More-pork</i>,' and <i>`Mope-hawk'</i>; both forms are more than fifty years old. The r sound, however, is not present in the note of the bird, although the form <i>More-pork</i> is perhaps even more popular than the true form <i>Mope-hawk</i> seems to have been adopted through dislike of the perhaps coarser idea attaching to `pork.' The quaint spelling <i>Mawpawk</i> seems to have been adopted for a similar reason. [1827 Tasmania]
