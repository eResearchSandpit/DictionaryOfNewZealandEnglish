Quote:  ...the Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Simon Upton, and his cabinet colleagues have apparently decided that the orphaned Antarctic Division of DSIR is to be located in the Ministry of External Relations and Trade (Mert)... Yet the location of the division within Mert also indicates trhat New Zealand does not really believe its own claim to Antarctica.
