Quote:  NEW ZEALAND MEGRIM or WITCH (MAHUE) <i>Caulopsetta scaphus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... In Napier it is known as Lantern-fish, but for what reason I am unable to say, unless it is from the peculiar transparency when it/is held up to a strong light. Another name given to this useless fish by local fishermen, in Port Chalmers at least, was that of Cadger's-fish.
