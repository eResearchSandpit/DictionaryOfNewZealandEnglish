Quote:  Evolution of <i>Stilbocarpa</i>. a megaherb from New Zealand's sub-antarctic islands... The humid climate, cool equable temperatures, locally abundant nutrients, and absence of herbivores are ecological features of the sub-antarctic islands that may have contributed to the evolution of the unusual megaherb, <i>Stilbocarpa</i>, from these diminutive apiaceous ancestors.

Quote:  Megaherb describes certain plant species that grow on the Sub-antarctic Islands of New Zealand. They are usually quite colourful and have large leaves considering their native environment. These species have adapted very well to growing in a harsh environment but have become so specialised they are dificult to grow elsewhere. <i>Anisotome latifolia</i> is an example of one of these megaherbs.
