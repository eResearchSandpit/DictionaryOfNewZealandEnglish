Quote:  <i>Mortar-box</i>: The large cast-iron box fitted with heavy cast-iron dies in which five head of 1250 lb stamps dropped 110 times per minute on to the quartz, reducing it to pulp which passed 10-mesh screens at the rate of about 7 tons per 24 hours. There was a constant flow of water through the box which carried away the crushed material through the screens for classification and further grinding in the tube-mills.
