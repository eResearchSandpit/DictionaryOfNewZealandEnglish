Quote:  ... not for a long time have I observed such an odd symptom of our <i>malaise </i>as the business of `marching girls'. This cult has not only established itself firmly in New Zealand: it is even being exported. ... Enquiries I have made as to the origin of this astonishing sport, or prank, ... have so far been fruitless. It has the earmarks of being an American invention, but I cannot be at all sure about this [suggests Air Force training grounds].

Quote:  The first record of 'Marching Girls' is in the official history of the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901. During the Dunedin celebrations, about 500 girls marched past as a celebration of 'girls' drill'.

Quote:  Part of the answer may also be found in an innocent exhibitionism; marching girls are really modelled on the drum majorettes who strut and prance at the head of American processions.

Quote:  [Caption] Marching girls in a drill display at Basin Reserve, Wellington, in 1936... It is not easy to win a marching medal these days, so when you next see a marching girl with a display of medals that would make a Field Marshal envious you will realise that the walking jingle represents many hours of hard practice.

Quote:  "Tell me," I asked, "why playing in an orchestra is better than marching girls?" She turned over lazily. "Because they are engaged in making something bigger than themselves, and they are more potent together than they are alone."

Quote:  Fiona Samuel, The Marching Girls writer, has always thought marching teams are ""neat".... The Marching Girls, which is as much about the lives of a group of New Zealand women as it is about marching, fitted the bill exactly. Even if they are called marching "girls".

Quote:  In sport ... <i>marching girls</i> appear to have been a New Zealand idea, though already on July 1952 when A.R.D. Fairburn wrote about them in the periodical <i>Here and Now</i> (Vol. 2, no. 10, p. 9), the origin of the idea could not easily be traced.
