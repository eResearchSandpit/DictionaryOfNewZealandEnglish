Quote:  Perhaps the most common of the outdoor dusk He games was `Moonlight, starlight, Bogey won't come out tonight.' We had several paddocks divided off by hedges, and the neighbouring children always congregated for games after their chores were done. We usually ended with Moonlight Starlight. As the bogey was at liberty to move 'round, one never knew where the next pounce was coming from. (1910; Nelson)
