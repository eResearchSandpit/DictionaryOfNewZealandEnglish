Quote:  <i>miromiro</i>, a bird (Petroeca toitoi), North Island tomtit; white-breasted tit it differs from the South Island form (P. macrocephala) yellow-breasted tit in the colouration of the breast. Whilst miromiro was the name of the North Island bird, both of them bore the name ngirungiru, so that has been adopted for the South Island form, though the South Island Maori would probably give the `ng' sound scurvy treatment and call the bird kirukiru, as he calls ngaio kaio.
