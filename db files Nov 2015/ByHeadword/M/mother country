mother country

Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:England; later, Britain, the UK. Used as a sentimental expatriates' term from almost the beginning of settlement, and as an indication of the nature of the ties of loyalty to Britain. Since WW2 would, I think, be generally regarded as too sentimental for born-Kiwi use, and more suited to recent, unassimilated immigrants. Cf. Home
