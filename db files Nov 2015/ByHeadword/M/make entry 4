Quote:  Castle Hill was the best country I've been on to `make' a dog and it was while there that I at last met with some success on the trial ground. I'd picked up a young heading dog ... which ... was the greatest dog I've ever seen at getting on good terms with - or `making' - sheep. Sheep just never seemed to give any trouble with him.
