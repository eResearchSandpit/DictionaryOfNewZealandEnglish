Quote:  The Rev. Taylor.. describes a few occasions when he ate mamaku pith boiled in tutu juice - a dish he describes as 'quite acceptable'. On his West Coast expedition in 1846, Heaphy resorted to mamaku as a food many times, and although he generally found it disapopointing, he did comment that 'when mixed with wine, sugar and spice in a tart, it might be mistaken for baked apple.'

Quote:   ... I got a Man who went & fetched me a Fern-tree with root and all, he called it <i>Ma[macron]a[macron,grave]gu</i>, & as I pointed to a large ferntree near me, with leaves whose underside is white, he shewed me the difference & called the latter <i>Po[grave]nga.</i> This Tree is full of tender pulp, ... and I believe this Fern is nearly related to the <i>Sago</i>-tree, which is likewise a Fern.

You found the incoming Ngati-Porou along the coast following the fishing grounds and the warm areas for kumara and taro cultivation, while the `tangata whenua' stuck to the hinter-land and forests, faring on `mamaku' [ed fn: Edible tree fern (<i>Cyathea medullaris</i>)], `aruhe', eels and huahua.

[note 234] Presumably a contraction of mamaku (cyathea medullaris). The term seems peculiar to Robin Hyde - it was never in general use.
