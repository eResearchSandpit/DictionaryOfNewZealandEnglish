Quote:  Between the shafts, strong, shaggy, horses stand quietly, and on each cart two or three milk-cans gleam in the morning sunlight [at Ruatoki]. It's the end of the `Milk Cart Derby'.

For the last hour or so the carts have been rattling in along the rough roadways leading in from the 120 farms that comprise the settlement. [49] ... The `Milk Cart Derby,' as it is known to many who have seen it, is the key to Ruatoki.
