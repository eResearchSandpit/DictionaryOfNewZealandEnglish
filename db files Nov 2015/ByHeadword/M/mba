Quote:  And despite the jokes - "How do you tell an MBA graduate? They're the ones with bullet-points on their Christmas cards" - and the suspicion that for graduates from some courses, the words MBA stand for Medicore But Arrogant, it's less clear from the failings of companies such as Air New Zealand and Brierley Investments that corporate performance in New Zealand has to improve if the country is ever to achieve its targeted four per cent growth.
