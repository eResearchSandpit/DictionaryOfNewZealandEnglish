Quote:  Monkfish, which is sweetish in flavour, can be covered with a potato sauce and then dusted with cocoa for a bitter contrast... Martin is deperate one day to be allowed to buy a whole monkfish, so he can get at the liver and have a play. In Europe, chefs pay a fortune for monkfish liver, which is described as the foie gras of the sea, whereas New Zealand fishermen fillet the monkfish on board their boats and probably toss the liver overseas.
