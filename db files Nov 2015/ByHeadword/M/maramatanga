Quote:  It provides a perfect metaphor for both the subject and the persona dramatis of this absorbing, well-researched book focusing on the Maramatanga movement, a Maori belief system that grew out of a desire to incorporate the ancient tohunga ways with the teachings of the New Testament... Based around the Ruapehu area and stretching as far as the Whanganui River area, the Maramatanga is a unique series of beliefs. Although the majority of its practitioners belong to the Roman Cathlic branch of Christianity, the teaching of Rikiriki, who was both a prophet and a healer, are designed to being together the old and the new, rather than the outright rejection of the old ways preferred by most Protestant missionaries.

Quote:  <i>Maramatanga</i> literally means <i>enlightenment</i> or <i> understanding</i>. The people of the Maramatanga belong to a prophetic and religious movement who by faith, story, waiata and ritual have sustained their identity and autonomy in the face of an overwhelming Pakeha society.
