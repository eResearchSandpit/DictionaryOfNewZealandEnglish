Quote:  Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu.
