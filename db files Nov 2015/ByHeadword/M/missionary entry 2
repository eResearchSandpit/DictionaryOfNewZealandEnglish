Quote:  I certainly have never been able to discover any great difference in the conduct of the converted and the unconverted - if any difference really exists, it seems by general consent to be given in favor of the latter - indeed, the word Missionaries is used by the Europeans here only to distinguish those rogues, for whose superior rascallity we have no other sufficiently comprehensive term in our language. The fact is, they are all whether converted or unconverted, radically bad - and it is my own opinion as well as that of every one else whom I have conversed with on the subject, that no permanent good can be done among them until they are placed under a power, which shall be at once their terror, their protection, and their model.
