Quote:  A special report on the subject which the medical statistics branch of the Health Department has issued makes this point [of the prevalence of ear, nose, and throat disease among Maoris]. For more than half a century the `Maori ear' had been regarded in medical practice as a most unrewarding condition to treat in more ways than one and by both parties concerned, the report said. If future generations of Maori children retained their greater susceptibility to ear disease, every year would add to the size of the problem till it might become too big ever to be solved.
