Quote:  ... amongst which [in Queen Charlotte Sound] there are two [trees] that bear a sort of plumb the size of prunes, the one yellow [[Anderson's fn a] These are call'd Karraka by the natives.] and the other black, [[Anderson's fn b] Call'd Mai-tao by the Indians.] [1967 ed. comment sic [Tawa, <i>Beilschmiedia tawa</i>. The `Indian' name that Anderson gives is unknown to the dictionary, and may well be one of the many South Island Maori words that were never collected.]]
