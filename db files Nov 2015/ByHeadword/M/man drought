Quote:  Salt attributes our "man drought" to the fact that young single males are more likely to stay away permanently or come back with an overseas born partner. .. Richard Bedford says the man drought is real but not nearly as bad as Salt says - and OE isn't causing it. .. Man Drought is due, suggests Bedford, to the compounding and cumulative effects of four factors:  more young men than women dying in accidents and from suicide; higher net migration loss among men; more women than men coming to New Zealand from some countries and a tendency for males to be under-counted at censuses.
