Quote:  `Missed writing to-day. Had to go to the Murder House instead.' `The Murder House?' My hand falters to my throat. `You mean the Headmaster's Study?' `No, the Dental Clinic. See?' He bares his gum, and through the crumbs I see two bleeding holes which lately housed two obstinate baby teeth.

Quote:  <i>murder house</i>: At most large schools, and for each collection of small ones, there is a small prefabricated building set slightly apart in which you can find one or more School Dental Nurses who do all of the preventive, and most of the corrective dental work (free) for the children in their schools. The children, unlike you and I?, consider a visit to the SCHOOL DENTAL CLINIC an unpleasant necessity, at best. Hence the name.
