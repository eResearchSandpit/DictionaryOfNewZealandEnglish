But he has not taken any notice of the Pitch Pine - Birch - And large Myrtle. ... The Myrtle is not so large, it grows near the water, has a red bark, and is known by the smell of its leaf which very much resembles the smell of the leaf from which its [sic] takes its name, it is of use for turners or Cabinet makers, makes excellent block Pins, and from its hardness may be converted to many uses with which I am unacquainted.

Quote:  The supple-jack is to be met with in all parts of the woods; and there is here also a species of the myrtle similar to that found in various parts of New South Wales. Another part of it grows in the country about Dusky Bay, an infusion of which was drank [sic] by the crew of the Endeavour, as a substitute for tea.
