Quote:  Hitherto it has been commonly supposed that [<i>Maoriland</i>] was originated by the <i>Bulletin,</i> Sydney, after 1880. The <i>Bulletin </i>certainly uses the initials M.L. to signify New Zealand, and may possibly have used the derivative<i> Maorilander</i> for a New Zealander, originally, although this is to be doubted.
