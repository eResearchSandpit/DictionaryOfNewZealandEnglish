Quote:  Maori freehold land is essentially land which the Native (or since 1945 Maori) Land Court has converted from customary Maori tenure to English freehold tenure and has not been alienated by its Maori  possessors. There are a good  many specialised terms in this field such as ahiwhenua trust and putea trust.
