Maori
Homonym Number:
Word Class: noun
Sense Number:
Definition:an aboriginal or native New Zealander; pertaining to the Maori. Spg <i>Mouri, Mauri, Mawnee</i>, [? typographical or transcription error], in the earliest texts; <i>mouray Mao[diereis]ri Maori</i> from at least 1842 (with occasional lower case m.) Plural. Mauries, Mauris, Mouries, Maories; Mauri, Mouri, Maori. The plural <i>Maories</i> can be found in written texts to the 1870's or 1880's; and is not uncommon in informal written English today, though usually regarded as a spelling error. The plural <i>Maori</i> has been usual among those with knowledge of Maori; and among those who are sensitive to Maori usage or feeling.

<i>Synonyms.</i> Leaving aside the very early (Cook, Banks) <i>Indian </i>q.v., early writers used <i>native</i> (as n and aj.) or <i>New Zealander </i>q.v. as the preferred terms, with<i> aborigine</i> q.v. being common in early writing asociated with `imperial' agencies as the Colonial Office and the Church Missionary Society, and was reinforced by the early appointment of a <i>Protector of Aborigines</i>. Early uses of <i>Maori</i> were usually tagged with an explanatory `native"; and indeed <i>Maori </i>did not replace <i>Native</i> in official use until 1947 when the name of the Department of Native Affairs was replaced by `Maori Affairs'.

Quote:  <i>Maori, n.</i> (pronounced so as to rhyme with <i>Dowry</i>). (I) The name used to designate themselves by the Polynesian race occupying New Zealand when it was discovered by the white man, and which still survives. They are not aboriginal as is commonly supposed, but migrated into New Zealand about 500 years ago from Hawaii, the tradition still surviving of the two great canoes <i>Arawa</i> and <i>Tainui</i> in which the pioneers arrived. They are commonly spoken of as the <i>Natives</i> of New Zealand. -->(2) The language of the Maori race. -->(3) Applied to anything pertaining to the Maoris or their language. See Pakeha.

-->There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other

quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i>was fresh-water, ordinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.)

The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.
