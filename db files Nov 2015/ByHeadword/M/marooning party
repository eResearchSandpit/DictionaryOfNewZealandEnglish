Quote:  We landed about 2, inorder [sic] to dress our dinner: ... We left the beach at five & went up this Arm, till it was quite dark: & then took up our Quarters for the Night, but as it is highly [271] improbable, for people that have not been at Sea & especially that have not frequented uncultivated Countries to form an Idea of the manner of living on a <i>marooning</i> party, to form an adquate Idea of these parties, we intend to give one here in this place. The first thing is to look out for a good place with a gentle beach with wood & a brook close to it. After landing everybody is busy to get dry wood, a necessary article in so wet a Country as New-Zeeland. [There follows a full description: roast food, grog, jollity and storytelling, etc]
