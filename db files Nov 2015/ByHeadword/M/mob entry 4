Quote:  A few more cases [of our indebtedness to Australia for much of our early pastoral vocabulary includes] the word `mob' for a collection of animals whether it be horses, cows, sheep, goats, or pigs. Although the words `herds' (of cattle) and `flocks' (of sheep) were occasionally used, they were too pedantic for ordinary use, and the word `mob' was indiscriminately used on nearly all occasions.
