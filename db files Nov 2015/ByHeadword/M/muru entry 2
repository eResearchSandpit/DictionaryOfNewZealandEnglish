Quote:  There were in the old times two great institutions, which reigned with iron rod in Maori land - the <i>Tapu</i> and the <i>Muru</i>. Pakehas who knew no better called the <i>muru</i> simply `robbery', because the word <i>Muru</i>, in its common signification, means to plunder. But I speak of the regular legalized and established system of plundering as penalty for offences, which in a rough way resembled our law by which a man is obliged to pay `damages'.

Quote:  A remarkable custom was that of `plunder' (<i>muru</i>). ... a method by which an offence was expiated.
