Quote:  The Catlins District Mossbanks: In the Catlins district, South Otago, there are large tracts of country more or less covered with what is known as "mossbank." These mossbanks are mounds or heaps of partly decayed vegetable matter lying on the surface of the soil and varying in depth from 1 ft to 10 ft or more.  The acidity of mossbanks is very marked .. Under all mossbanks is to be found a hard pan at varying depths, and generally of undulating formation.
