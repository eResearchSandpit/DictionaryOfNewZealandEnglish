Notes: often now used of the whole complex of courtyard, meeting-house, and ancillary buildings and grounds. Also in modern use as urban marae, a marae complex designed to serve Maori townspeople of mixed iwi affiliation who have moved away from their tribal areas.  Maori meeting-houses as such are post-European: to be distinguished from carved houses : meeting-place the marae; but the Maori marae must be distinguished from the larger ritualistic Tahitian marae

Quote:  Marae - marae are not just the buildings on a piece of land, though we can refer to particular marae. Marae need people and their customs for them to be anything meaningful. The front of the marae is called the atea (from `Te mare nui atea o Tu matauenga' - the big marae of Tu, the god of war). Marae are places where the Maori may assert his/her uniqueness and culture, and are used for tangi, feasts, meetings, weddings and many other reasons.

The whare nui is boarded up ... None of its carvings and tukutuku are in place and the carvings are still tapu. The whare wananga beside it, meant to house the kohanga reo, lies uncompleted, torn building paper flapping.
