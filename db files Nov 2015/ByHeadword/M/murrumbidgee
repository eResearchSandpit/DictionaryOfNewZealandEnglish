Quote:  Each player paid two shillings for a numbered wooden marble which the banker would throw from a basket container which he held in his hands and shook occasionally. The person receiving the marble with the highest number was paid the pool less banker's percentage .... The game, or rather gamble, was called Murrumbidgee which probably indicates, that it was originated, or at least was played, in that part of Australia [ca 1928].
