Quote:  The phenomenon [of wool core becoming coarser on testing] has been noted by farmers using all forms of fleece testing, and has been commonly refered to as 'micron creep' or 'diameter shrinkage.' Micron creep occurs when fleeces which have been objectively tested are lotted into discreet micron bins. The actual cause of micron creep is imprecision of the measurement.
