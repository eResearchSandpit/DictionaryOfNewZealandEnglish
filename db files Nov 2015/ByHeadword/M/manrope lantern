Quote:  The `manrope' party were so called because they had to descend to their claim by means of man ropes in the Gorge of Slate River. ... Lanterns were an unknown luxury on the diggings and one of the party invented by breaking the bottom out of an `Old Tom' bottle, and this was carried upside down with a candle dropped into the neck of it. This has always since been known as a `manrope lantern' [on the Nelson goldfields, c 1857-59]
