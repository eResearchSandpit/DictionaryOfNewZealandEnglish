Quote:  Mountain five-finger (<i>Pseudopanax colensoi</i>) also has a wide range, but is absent north of 36[degrees]S and from Stewart Island. I have observed it growing as an  epiphyte on kaikawaka or mountain cedar  (<i>Libocedrus bidwillii</i>) on Mt. Taranaki ... <i>Ibid.</i>  166 Some of the other shrub species with relatively large thick leaves are <i>Griselinia littoralis</i> (broadleaf), <i>Pseudopanax colensoi</i> (mountain  five-finger) and <i>Olearia colensoi</i> (leatherwood).
