Quote:   ... but it was this dog's `kindness' that so impressed me. The sheep were big, strong, touchy Merino wethers, easily upset, and when Boy finally walked them into the ring they were like three pets. ... When those sheep entered the ring they were really `made', and Bill could have done anything with them.
