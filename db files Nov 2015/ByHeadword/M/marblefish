Quote:  GRANITE TROUT or MARBLE FISH (KEKE) <i>Dactylosargus arctidens maeandratus</i> Richardson The common names of this fish are derived from the resembalance of the skin to marble or granite. The ground colour is black, mottled or waved with slaty-grey. At one time this fish was sold in Auckland and Wellington as Maori Chief but I do not know why this should be, as the true Maori Chief is quite different and not at all like the Granite Trout.
