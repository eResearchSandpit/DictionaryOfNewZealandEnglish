Quote:   There is scarcely a bare stem to be seen, even the tallest are embraced by a variety of twining plants, parasites and creepers, amongst which the <i>kia-kia</i>, decked at every joint with bunches of iris-shaped leaves, and the <i>mangamanga,</i> a creeping fern, are the most conspicuous; the <i>kareo</i>, also, forming a network of cane-like stems, hangs its bunches of glossy leaves pendant from every bough, and many others of equal beauty join to form a verdant arch, midway between the spreading branches of the noble trees to which they cling.

Quote:  <i>LYGODIUM ARTICULATUM</i> (Schizaeceae). The strangest thins about mangemange is that the true stem is very short but the leaf goes on growing at its tip and may be many metres long. In kauri forest these tough wiry leaves wind round trees and shrubs in an impenetrable network. Such a tangle makes thin strong vines suitable for securing thatch on a whare, as wire might be used today.
