Quote:  Hamilton Beach's deco brackets, their pods poised above gleaming mixer arms that de;ivered milkshakes in cool, tall aluminium beakers, were the heart of the milk bar at a time when milk was the cool drink. So cool that heavy dudes, Harley riders, even, were known as milk bar cowboys and jukebox music was eroding the moral fabric of the nation. Great milk bars were places of style and social consequence when pubs were slop houses and restaurants served no wine; serious places that demanded serious drinking, and there was nothing more serious than a milkshake.

Quote:  During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city. These young people congregated in the streets and milk-bars. Many of them had motor-cycles ... At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'. <i>Ibid.</i> 2 Milk Bar Cowboys show more individual variation in their dress, and do not display the cleanness and neatness of the Teddy Boy. Leather jackets and trousers tucked into the tops of high wool-lined boots are common. Their interests centre round motor-cycles and cars; many wear one or more of the badges issued by motor-cycle manufacturers. Youths of this type are common in the Christchurch streets at the week-end. It is worth noting that whereas the name of Teddy Boy is accepted proudly, that of Milk Bar Cowboy is not. Boys who appear to conform to this type will repudiate the label.

Quote:  <i>larrikin</i>: Young people of whom you happen not to approve. Note that all the terms of disapprobation for rumbustious youth left the rest of the world when youth took it over and crawled off to die in New Zealand where the old have such a strong hold. Expressions still used are `milk-bar cowboy', `flagon wagon gang' and even occasionally `Teddy boy.'
