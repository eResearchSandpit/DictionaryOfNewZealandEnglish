Quote:  Take all skin and bone away from some cold white fish and flake the flesh into pieces about the size of whitebait.   Roll in flour, and leave them a little time;  then fry in a frying basket with plenty of boiling fat until they are crisp and brown.   Serve at once very hot after dusting with a little pepper.   Serve lemon and cayenne pepper with them.
