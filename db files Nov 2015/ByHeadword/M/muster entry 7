Notes: (The word seems to have been introduced to Canterbury) Acland (1933) notes the following musters on high-country stations. -->So far as I know the usual ones are (beginning in the spring): <i>the cutting and tailing muster; shearing</i> muster; <i>straggle</i> muster (in the old days the shorn sheep were always turned not before the country .us;was straggled, <i>so that they would lead the woolies in); dipping or wearing </i>m.; <i>straggle </i>again; then <i>scratch</i> m. or <i>`lock-over' </i>to get the last of the sheep off the summer country before winter. This last is an undress sort of muster, the men catching what stragglers they can in the basins. There are always other partical musters of the flock; e.g., ewes to ram, or eye-slipping of hoggets.

Quote:  <i>Muster</i>.-A city correspondent asks for the names of the various musters on high country stations. So far as I know the usual ones are (beginning in spring): the cutting and tailing <i>m.</i>; shearing <i>m.</i>; straggle <i>m.</i>(in old days the shorn sheep were always turned out before the country was straggled, so that they would lead the woolies in); dipping or weaning <i>m.</i> (to wean the lambs and dip the ewes); fall (or autumn) m.; straggle again; then scratch <i>m.</i> or `look over' to get the last of the sheep off the summer country before winter. This last is an undress sort of <i>m.</i>, the men catching what stragglers they can in the basins. There are always other partial <i>ms</i>. of the flock; <i>e.g.</i>, ewes to ram or eye clipping of hoggets.
