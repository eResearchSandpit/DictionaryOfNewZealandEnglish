Quote:  In the southern part of Hawera district, early bush flows of nectar can be expected from five finger, Maori privet, and kowhai from September onward. Usually there is a light flow from Maori privet (Geniostoma ligustrifolium) in this area, and this surplus is taken from the bush hives in early November.
