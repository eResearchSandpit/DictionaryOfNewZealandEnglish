Quote:  Rakaia Terrane may have been docked in the Middle Jurassic, coincident with the temporary cessation of volcanism in the Median Tectonic Zone, Kirwan's Dolerite emplacement, a phase of metamorphism through the region, minnor uplift of the Murihiku Basin to give its shallower marine and non-marine Temaikan sequence in both New Zealand and New Calaedonia, and the change from Maorian provinciality to a strong Tethyan influence in benthic fauna.
