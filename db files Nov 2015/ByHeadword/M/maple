Quote:  The perversity with which the true `beeches' have become popularly known as `birches,' and different kinds of `mapau' as `maples - a popular name which includes small trees of widely distinct Natural Order, is enough to fill with despair any botanist who desires to foster a system of popular names that will be free from misleading and inaccurate suggestions.

Quote:  [<i>Pittosporum eugenioides</i>] it is often cultivated for its beauty, and is sometimes - though not so often as <i>P. [195] tenuifolium</i> - used to form an ornamental hedge. It is known by a variety of names amongst the colonists, such as <i>Mapau, White Mapau</i>, and even<i> Maple</i>, and <i>Lemon-tree.</i> The Maori name seems to have been <i>Tarata,</i> but it is also called the <i>Mapau. </i>
