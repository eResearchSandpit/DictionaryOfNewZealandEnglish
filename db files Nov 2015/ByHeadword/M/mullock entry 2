Quote:  I remember we had `bubble and squeak' for breakfast that morning. `Mullock' my father called it. I'd often heard the term used by the miners and I imagined they meant rubbish or muck when they spoke of it, but I understood that my father was only teasing when he referred to our favourite breakfast as `mullock'.
