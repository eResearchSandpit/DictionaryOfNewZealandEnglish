Quote:  My apologies.. if I did not make it sufficiently clear in describing Matariki that the celebration of a New Year marked by the winter solstice is the "tradition" that links it with Hogmanay and the Saturnalia. It did not occur to me that this might be misconstrued as a suggestion that Maori had been celebrating Matariki here for millennia.

Quote:  Winter might not be the easiest time of the year to rise before dawn, but it's the only chance to see Matariki, a cluster of stars that heralds the Maori New Year... Matariki is celebrated differently by each iwi,. but the New Year begins with the first new moon after the appearance of Matariki.

Quote:  At Te Kuiti I never saw the Pleiades because of the hills. Years afterwards, when I lived on the broad plains, I saw that heliacal rising, a handful of sparks on the horizon, until the sun blew them out. Mr Tawhai called them Te Matariki.

Quote:  But what is Matariki and why has this ancient tradition, which hasn't been much practised by

Maori for the past 150 years, suddenly taken off again? Matariki is the Maori name for the beautiful little cluster of stars that is commonly known as the Pleiades or the Seven Sisters, Roughly translated, it means "little-eyes".... At the end of May, Matariki reappears in the morning sky, rising just before dawn... So Matariki is linked to the universal celebration of midwinter. It's the antipodean equivalent of the Scots' hogmanay or the Chinese New Year - in fact it has traditions that go back further than the Roman Saturnalia.
