Quote:  When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. It is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.

Quote:  <i>ma[a]nuka</i>, a shrub (Leptospermum scoparium), commonly called tea-tree, because Cook's people used the fresh young leaves infused for tea; but very often mis-spelt ti-tree - ti being something totally different, the cabbage tree (Cordyline). The tree-manuka is kanuka, with smaller leaves and smaller flowers than the scrub-manuka, and it is the kanuka that is usually sold for firewood. I spoke to a dealer about it, and he said they dodged the confusion by selling it as T.T. There is a crimson-flowering variety of manuka known in England as a rarity, but by means of slips (not seed) it has become not uncommon. The starry-flowered manuka would have been adopted as the national flower but for the fact that it is too prolific, and apt to become a nuisance. It has a second name, kahika[a]toa but that is discouraged on account of its spelling being so nearly the same as kahikatea, the white pine, though in sound they are quite different, the macron in hahika[a]toa causing an apparent accent which, when observed, clearly differentiates the two words: it is not an accent, however, but a lengthening of the vowel.

Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side.
