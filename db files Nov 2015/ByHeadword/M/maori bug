Quote:  ... The term <i>Maori bunk</i> for a shelf that serves as a common bed for several people is obviously a New Zealand expression and in no doubt due to the Maori habit of having a common sleeping floor. How well known the term is outside tramping circles I do not know, but the device was not unknown in the inns of rural France, I understand.

Quote:   The ground on which our camp was situated had been bush, and had plenty of logs and stumps on it, and the camp swarmed with `Maori bugs,' as the men called them. The Maori's name for these horrible insects is <i>kekerengu</i>. They are about one inch and a half long and resemble a black cockroach in appearance.

Quote:  There are very few cockroaches, the ones met with in habitations being exotic ones; the best known native species is the unpleasant stink-roach, often incorrectly called the `black beetle', and too frequently referred to as the `Maori bug' - a term that should be avoided because it is a name just as objectionable to the Maori as the insect's odour is to the Europeans who coined the name; however, it has been said that the term is a corruption of the original and inoffensive European name of `kauri bug'.
