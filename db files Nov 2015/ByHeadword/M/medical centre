Notes: Jim Cameron writes : See Yellow Pages. There are also places called <i>Health Centres</i>. The definition of a health centre in NSOD and Collins, is premises owned by a local authority providing health care, usually housing a group practice, nursing staff, etc. premises. OED defines it as a local centre for a group practice. It seems to be used loosely in NZ, sometimes simply as a variant of medical centre, sometimes in relation to para-medical services eg <i>Chiropractic Health Centre</i>. Medical centre is not in any dictionary. But see use in Ruth Rendell <i>Harm Done</i>. [medical centre is given as illustr. at medical in ODE - TD]
