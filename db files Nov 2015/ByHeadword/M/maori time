Quote:  The phrase "Maori time" has not been abroad much of late, but recent events have highlighted a linguistic gap that it will fill very neatly. Maori time is a period of 12 days, or the length of time that elapses between a major disaster and the government's getting around to doing something about it when that disaster affects a predominantly Maori community, say, in the Far North.
