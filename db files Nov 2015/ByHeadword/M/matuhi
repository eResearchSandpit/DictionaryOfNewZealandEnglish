Quote:  In addition to the rock wren, there is another species, <i>Xenicus longiceps</i>, the bush wren or matuhi. This bird is also very small, of darker green colouring and with a white throat. It is found in damp rimu and beech forests on the West Coast of the South Island, and builds its nest in hollow trees and, like the rock wren, lines it with feathers.
