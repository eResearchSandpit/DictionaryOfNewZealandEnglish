Quote:  Birds were lured with a tape-recorded call before being steered into super-fine netting, using a morepork as a decoy ("the birds tend to mob any bird of prey")... <i>Ibid.</i> 69 Again, through iron patience, determination and mnountains of trial and error, he discovered what moreporks fed their chicks. <i>Ibid.</i> 70 A stunning black and white image of a morepork coming in to land, its wings fully, perfectly splayed, frozen in flight, is the logo that graces his letterhead...
