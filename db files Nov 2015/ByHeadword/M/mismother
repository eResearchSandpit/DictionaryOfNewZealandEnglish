Quote:  Ewes with lambs will not 'follow on' the same as dry sheep will. Instinctively they know that once in a mob they will mis-mother. Under no circumstances should ewes and lambs be bunched to the extent that they mis-mother.

Quote:  The manager of an adjoining station once told me that he saw about 5,000 Merino ewes and lambs yarded on one occasion by an inexperienced man, and about 200 were smothered before the men started tailing. Then they let the ewes and lambs out on to a big block,

<i>yard by yard as they finished,</i> the result being that fully 500 lambs were mis-mothered, some of the ewes being miles away before the mob was through.
