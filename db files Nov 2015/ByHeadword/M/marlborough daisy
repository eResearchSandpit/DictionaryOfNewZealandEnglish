Quote:  In its stony native habitat the Marlborough Daisy is often straggly and less prepossessing, which may explain why it has been notably lacking from private gardens despite their eye appeal and the fact that they were discovered way back in 1853. Its discoverer first classed it with the Olearia genus but it was later given its own genus, <i>Pachystegia</i>, a family which occurs naturally only in New Zealand.
