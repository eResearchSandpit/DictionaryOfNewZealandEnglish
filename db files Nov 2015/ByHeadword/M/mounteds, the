Quote:  THE MOUNTED RIFLEMAN [title] New Zealanders in these regions are popularly referred to, in their Homeland, as `The Mounteds'; and as being indicative of their pecularities in method of warfare, the term has its value. In origin, the Mounted Riflemen date back to the 'sixties, when that fine soldier, Major Sir Harry Atkinson, formed the settler-riflemen into a mounted force of a nature demanded by the topographical and tactical conditions of the fiercely-contested Maori wars.
