Quote:  In New Zealand, Maori men knew that cracks in the heart-wood of old matai trees often exude a liquid, matai beer, a stimulating drink that weary white bushmen later discovered.

Quote:  Matai beer was described by a Taihape newspaper in 1912 as tasting "like used machine oil... When a deep swig is absorbed, one has all the sensations of having swallowed a lighted kerosene stove."

Quote:   ... I dimly remember as a youngster in the days when the Forty-Mile Bush was still standing, such a drink as `matai beer' was sometimes spoken of amongst bushmen. Apparently it was made from the sap of the matai tree, extracted by the simple process of boring an auger-hole in the trunk. ... Can any old-timer axeman give any information concerning this liquor.

Quote:  When I was a boy I lived in Carterton, and that was in the 'sixties, when there was little else than bush there ... I have frequently drunk the matai beer which gushes out of the centre of the tree when the axemen get to the heart. The flavour varies, but always has something of the tang of resin about it, though it is not at all a bad drink. ... I never heard of this matai beer being intoxicating; ...

Quote:  In the rip-roaring times of the King Country, Matai beer was a favourite with those who were strong enough and tough enough to drink it. It went out of favour when `cruisers' for the various timber mills complained that much good yellow pine was being ruined through the number of deep axe cuts and even auger holes in the standing trees, made to let the potent juice run into waiting pannikins or buckets. The favourite recipe for this form of wood alcohol represented the addition of three or four cupsful of the sap to each gallon of `ordinary' liquid refreshment. That the resultant mixture had a pretty hefty kick to it may be judged from this description handed in to the Taihape newspaper (1912): `Matai beer is the term used to describe a certain brand or grade of alcoholic brew. It may be identified easily. It smells like an ancient bar room the morning after. It tastes like used machine oil, only a very low grade of machine oil.

Quote:  But [bushmen] used to make concoctions of their own, and the most popular ... was matai beer. ... When you felled a big matai, a really mature black pine ... you would see the main artery in the heart of the tree gushing out the life liquid. ... It wasn't the sap; this was not related to that. It was a pure clear liquid, and it gushed out like the main artery gushing blood. But that used to be prized, and it would be caught in a billy. That was really something. It was beautiful and cool and sweet to drink as it was, but some of the blokes used to bung in maybe a handful of raisins and sugar and cork her up and let her ferment, and whether that fluid had any other properties in it or not I don't know, but you could get quite a potent drink from it.

Quote:  MATAI BEER [title] I have been told by old bushmen and Maoris about making beer from the sap of the matai tree ... Apparently when the tree was being cut down the watery sap was collected, more water was added and also some ordinary beer, or yeast. It was left to ferment and was reputed to be quite strong though I have not been able to find any written evidence of this.
