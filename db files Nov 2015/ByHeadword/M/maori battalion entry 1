Quote:  `The big land scheme for the Maori Battalion men'. In the second world war Maoris served willingly, without the distrust that marked their attitude to fighting for the pakeha in the first world war. Maori soldiers served in the 28th Battalion (`the Maori Battalion') in North Africa, Crete, and Italy.
