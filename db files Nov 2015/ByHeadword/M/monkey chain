Quote:  The <i>learners' chain</i> is called the <i>monkey chain</i>, and the new chaps are called <i>skulls</i>, from the chaffing at the beginning: e.g., `Look at the skulls on them!', `They've got the right-shaped head for it'. Learners retaliate by calling the old hands `lavatory chains' or more frequently `shithouse chains'.
