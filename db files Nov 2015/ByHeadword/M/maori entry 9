Quote:  Security of tenure was needed before any scheme to resuscitate the citrus industry could be commenced with successful prospects. Recommendations were therefore made to enable one member of the family to have, by communal aggreement in the Native Land Court, a definite area of the land held within the

<i>kopu tangata</i>. Consequent upon such an agreement the occupier was confirmed as the owner under Maori custom and became capable of pledging the freehold to the administration as security for financial and material advances.
