Quote:  It pulled up at the Pelorus Hotel, Canvastown, and ... the travellers went to the dining room, where mine host, Tom Dillon, presided at the head of a long table and carved the joints. `What'll you have, beef or mountain mutton?' he asked. ... The young man gave his order ... and was served with slices of juicy, tender venison. In those days deer were protected, to be shot only in season, and under licence, so what the travellers ate was poached. It was a feature of the hotel, under mountain mutton.
