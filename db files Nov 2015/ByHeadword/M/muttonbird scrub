Quote:  On windswept Ackers Point, at the tip of the peninsula, the main vegetation is muttonbird scrub; muttonbirds (sooty shearwaters) nest in burrows beneath it in spring. The name "muttonbird scrub" has a derogatory ring to it, but the various tree daisies, with their white flowers and tough leathery leaves, furry white beneath, that fall under the muttonbird rubric are all beautiful shrubs.
