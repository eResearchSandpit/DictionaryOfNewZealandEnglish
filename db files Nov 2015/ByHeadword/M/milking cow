Quote:  <i>Caving method</i>: Also known as the `milking cow'; it applied to an area of several acres where the Mine Lake is now. The method started with the collapse of the large arches on the Martha reef about No. 1 shaft, and was later systematically developed by a series of sub-levels on Nos 7, 8 and 9 levels which were used to weaken this section of country and cause it to run so that it could be drawn off through chutes. It operated for a quarter-century and is conservatively estimated to have yielded over a million tons of good run-of-mine grade ore. <i>Ibid.</i> 327 <i>Milking Cow or Caving Block</i>: (See also caving method). A block of country between Nos 1 and 6 shafts and Junction Road, where the Mine Lake is now, which originally contained a network of large reefs and which collapsed after the removal of undergound support pillars and arches and became a caving area. It is estimated that over 1,000,000 tons of ore of good grade was obtained on Nos 7 and 8 levels by caving methods during a period of 25 years.
