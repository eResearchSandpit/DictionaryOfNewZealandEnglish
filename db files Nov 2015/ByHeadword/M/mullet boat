Quote:  The name of mullet-boats dates back to the very early days of New Zealand's colonization, and although there is no record for the first boat which was built in Auckland, there is sufficient evidence to say the type was evolved somewhere  about the year 1880.  The boats were designed for a specific purpose, the netting of mullet which abound in the shallow tidal reaches, creeks and estuaries of the Hauraki Gulf, and its environs.
