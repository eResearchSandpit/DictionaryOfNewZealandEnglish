Quote:  The few Maories that inhabit this settlement travel to the west coast by way of this river. They always go on foot, and we saw several traces of their encampments - little <i>mimis,</i> as they are called - a few light sticks thrown together, and covered with grass, affording a sort of half-and-half shelter for a single individual.

It was said to be a name for a black-fellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia', and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley', etc. by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.

Quote:  In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding in Canterbury, but, generally speaking, their advent was some years later in Otago. ... They brought over a number of Australian aborigine words that were new to this side, and which were used a certain amount, usually in a joking manner as far as I know. I have heard some of them fairly frequently used by the `old hands,' sometimes oracularly and sometimes as a semi-humorous quotation. When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.
