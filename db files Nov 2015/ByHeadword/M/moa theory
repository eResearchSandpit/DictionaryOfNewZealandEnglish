Quote:  We come now to the `moa theory' elaborated by Greenwood and Atkinson, which has found favour with some but disbelief from others. ... Essentially, Greenwood and Atkinson propose that the divaricating shrub habit is probably unique to New Zealand and results from an environmental factor that was also unique ..., namely the moas. [Divaricate habit prevented moa browsing.]
