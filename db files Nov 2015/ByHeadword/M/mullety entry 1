Quote:  Mulleties, which measured anything from 22 to 28 feet in length, were built for netting in the tidal upper reaches of the Waitamata, though they also proved useful for dredging mussels in the Firth of Thames and elsewhere... Not surprisingly, these nimble boats soon caught the attention of yachties, who bought them as pleasure craft and later ordered purpose-built mulleties for racing and cruising.

Quote:  In the summer I crewed on a mullety. The mulleties were over-canvassed in my cautious opinion, but a real thrill to sail... Mulleties were wide-beamed but had a shallow draft with a centreboard... A classic description of a weekend away in a mullety was: "It's like spending the weekend under the kitchen table with an 18-gallon keg."
