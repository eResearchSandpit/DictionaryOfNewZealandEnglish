Notes: "As a child it was one of my chores to cut and bring in the "morning wood". I guess it was so named because in the days of coal ranges, if you didn't have the "morning wood" to light the fire there would be no cuppa', no porridge or whitebait fritters in saseon! and no water for a bath." (Valerie Young); ca1920's (R. Mason) Kindling for lighting the fire in the morning. ca1983 Sept Canvastown : `the morningwood's too wet' - said of difficulty in lighting the Trout Hotel open fire at 5.00 pm.
