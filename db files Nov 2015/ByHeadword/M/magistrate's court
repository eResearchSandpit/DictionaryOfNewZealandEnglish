Quote:  Generally  known  simply  as magistrates (or SMs) they were legally qualified and exercised increasingly important judicial functions in magistrates courts  These had a general jurisdiction - civil, criminal and domestic - that set them apart from English magistrates courts which mainly dealt with petty crime and were presided over by justices of the peace. Magistrates courts were renamed district courts and their presiding judges district court judges in 1981, but the term magistrate in New Zealand denoted stipendiary magistrates rather than justices of the peace, who were and are usually referred to simply as justices or JPs.
