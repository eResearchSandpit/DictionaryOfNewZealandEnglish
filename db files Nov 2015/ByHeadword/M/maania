Quote:  Maori names for tussock varied from region to region. In one southern dialect, <i>wi</i> was used for silver tussock (furher north the same word was applied to rushes) and <i>patiti</i> seemed to be a general term for tall tussocks, with <i>maania</i> an alternative or the word for red tussock in particular. The Maniatoto (<i>maania</i> = blood, <i>toto</i> = plain) was formerly covered in red tussock.
