Notes: Jim writes: Introduced to NZ about 1901 and imported until 1924, after which they were made locally. See Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i> p 122 etc. An account of the development of the Marseilles tile roof in Australia is in Robin Boyd <i>Australia's Home</i> p. 151-153. Despite its European name and the original provenance of the tile, this term is not in British dictionaries I have seen. NSOD has only <i>Marseille ware</i> - a type of pottery produced in Marseilles during the 17th and 18th centuries. DEH adds: researching family geneology, I encountered a ship from Marseilles via Genoa to Sydney or NZ in 1909 from Marseille with a cargo of tiles. Many Kelburn houses have Marseilles tiles

Quote:  [Caption] The orange Marseille tiles are peculiar to the bungalows of Australasia... <i>Ibid.</i> 122 When Marseille tiles were introduced to New Zealand in about 1901, roofs took on a new colour and texture. The vivid terracotta-orange contrasted strongly with the drab red-oxide paint of iron roofs and the grey of slate.
