Quote:   The sign most often taken to indicate this sort of sickness is that the sickness does not appear to be yielding readily to ordinary Maori or to pakeha methods of treatment. It is then considered to be a Maori sickness - a `mate Maori' as the phrase is commonly used - and for sure, safe, and quick results, treatment should be referred to a Maori expert, a tohunga, either male or female, who will use a combination of religious prayer, seance-possession, and magic to restore the sick person to health.

Quote:   If a Maori is genuinely disturbed, in Maori terms, the answer again is to restore their mauri (life force), as for physical illness. This is particularly true for <i>mate</i> Maori, Maori sickness, which arises from spiritual and social causes, not physical ones (Pakehas would call it psychosomatic).

Quote:  Inexplicable sickness, <i>mate Maori</i>, is often attributed to evil forces living in the human body; their extraction, possible only by faith in the healer, is a major part of the role of a tohunga.

Quote:   Her son had refused to go to hospital for treatment of his mental condition, after an earlier visit to a local doctor. It has been revealed the youth was angry over such things as social and political issues in New Zealand and South Africa, as well as the nuclear issue. There is a suggestion that the youth also suffered from a form of spiritual illness, called mate Maori. The youth had been to see a Maori spiritual healer, a tohunga, but his mother said tapu forbids her from discussing his diagnosis.

Quote:  In 2000, Tariana Turia, who was then associate Maori affairs minister [sic], questioned whether psychologists had the appropriate training to deal with issues such as Maori sickness (mate Maori). Victoria University's head of Maori studies [sic], Peter Adds, said mate Maori was a fairly common condition.
