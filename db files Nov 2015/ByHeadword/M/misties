Quote:  [Homebake] was replaced in the 1990s by "misties", morphine sulphate tablets, heavy duty painkillers bought or stolen from cancer patients and traded on the black market... While the measured quantities of opiates in misties gave the users an idea of how much was too much, pure heroin is dangerous even for seasoned users.
