Quote:  The Maori or native swing is an amusement amongst the Taupo people which is obsolete upon the coast. A pole, generally the trunk of a <i>kaikatea</i> pine, is erected in the centre of an open space adjoining the village; flax ropes are suspended from the top, and, holding on to these, the natives swing round and round, in a manner similar to that which is practised in gymnasia and at country fairs in Europe.
