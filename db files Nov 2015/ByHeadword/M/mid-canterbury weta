Quote:  [Dr Gibbs] had heard occasional references to a giant "mid-Canterbury" or "Mt Somers" weta, not seen since once example was discovered in 1957, and he tracked down the one specimen to the Mount Albert Research Centre in Auckland... Mr Hunt told Dr Gibbs he remembered the weta well, especially its unusual markings of "red and black with possibly some white."
