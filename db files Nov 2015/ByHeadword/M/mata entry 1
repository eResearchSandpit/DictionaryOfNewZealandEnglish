Quote:  [The morepork castings in the Canterbury Museum] are hard pellets, of an oval form, and of the size of a Sparrow's egg, composed chiefly of the hard elytra and heads of various coleopterous insects, among which I noticed particularly the shiny covering of the mata (<i>Feronia antarctica</i>), a handsome ground-beetle which is found on the Canterbury Plains, but does not occur in the North Island.
