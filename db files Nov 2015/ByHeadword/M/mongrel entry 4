Quote:  Men were pine trees and they played for pride not cash. It wasn't pretty and it wasn't pure. In rugby circles they still call it "mongrel".

Quote:  Mongrel in sport used to be the bitser dog that strayed on to the field and held up the play. Now it's the magical quality that means the difference between winning and losing... Mongrel in its sporting sense was coined by Australians who are particularly good at coming up with pithy expressions whose meanings are clear. "Bugger off" was another of theirs we quickly borrowed.

Quote:  Respected creative writer Bill Manhire has put it another way. He suggests that New Zealand contains a touch of the mongrel; that contrary to Tourism Board advertising, we are not 100 per cent pure.

Quote:  But hang on, you cry, we need a bit more mongrel at the top level... Fair call, but what the Hurricanes are doing isn't "mongrel" rugby. Mongrel rugby is putting in big hits. Not taking a backward step. Sorting out opposition foul play the old-fashioned way, rather than bleating to an incompetent referee to do something.

Quote:  It was the FitzSimons of about 10 years ago when he was still a rugby player and got himself banished from the field in a game against the All Blacks because he showed so much mongrel he would have needed to buy boarding kennels.

Quote:  After the 1999 World Cup fiasco, the big question facing the All Blacks is: do they have something called "a bit of mongrel"?... Contrast that with legendary All Black skipper Buck Shelford, who lost a testicle in a match against France, was stitched up, and went straight back out on the field. There's a bit of mongrel for you.

Quote:  But what does mongrel actually mean? The old image of an enforcer, whose thuggery was committed in a noble cause?. <i>Ibid.</i> 35 Graeme Mourie was a dairy farmer, and a phenomenally successful All Black skipper. You wouldn't ever accuse him of being an old-style mongrel.
