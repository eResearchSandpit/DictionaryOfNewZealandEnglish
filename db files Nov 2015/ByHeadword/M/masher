Quote:  At the same time the practice rendered it unsafe for any girl to wait abroad for her legitimate lover or any wife for her husband. She was almost certain to be accosted by some prowling `masher"- a word that was in much more common use then than it is now - [20 years before] and cases of condign punishment for such audacity, at the hands of lover or husband, were so frequent as hardly to excite comment.

Quote:  He was a new chum just out from England, and we took a deal of notice of him at once, because he was the first masher we ever saw. He wore a curly brimmed hat and had curly brown hair, and dark-brown eyebrows that looked as if they were painted.. and he always carried a crutched stick in one hand and a pair of yellow gloves in the other, and he never came out without a flower in his buttonhole... All down our street, they called him "the beautiful mashah," and whenever he went by, we always used to say "Here comes the mashah, the beautifool mashah. Who wouldn' t be mashah? ''
