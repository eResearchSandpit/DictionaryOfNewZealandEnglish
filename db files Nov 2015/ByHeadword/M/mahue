Quote:  NEW ZEALAND MEGRIM or WITCH (MAHUE)<i> Caulopsetta scaphus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) In Napier it is known as Lantern-fish, but for what reason I am unable to say, unless it is from the peculiar transparency when it/is held up to a strong light. Another name given to this useless fish by local fishermen, in Port Chalmers at least, was that of Cadger's-fish.

Quote:  MEGRIM ... Sometimes called Lantern-fish (because a lantern could be easily shone through it) and known to the Maoris as `mahue' - the fish that is left behind. Known to Christchurch fishermen in early years as the Bludger's Fish. It was the fish they handed out to well-known bludgers who came down to the docks to cadge fish.

Quote:  Ironically, the most abundant of all New Zealand flounders, the witch or megrim, is useless for eating because of its multitude of long thin hair-like bones and thin watery flesh. The Maori name for this fish - mahue - says it all. It translates as `to be left behind'.

Quote:  <i>WITCH </i>(Megrim, mahue) <i>Arnoglossus scapha</i> ... The witch is a thin-bodied left eye floundr with an oval shape ... However, they have no commercial value as they have thin watery flesh and many fine bones.
