Quote:  Munter: Most commonly male. Below average intelligence. Buffoon. Little regard for what others think of him. Liable to do stupid things at regular intervals. Finds these acts humorous ... Munter means to me: male, generally has a mullet [type of haircut] and drives around in a classic car, sometimes hangs off rafters at certain Ponsonby bars, has also been known to go jet-skiing in the early morning munted [=pissed]... Usually sells weed [<i>cannabis indica</i>, as I'm sure you'll know!]. Ex-painters are automatically classified as munters. [God knows why!!] Will have a strong preference for Fords or Holdens. [Again God knows why!]
