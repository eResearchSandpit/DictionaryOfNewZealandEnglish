Quote:  This is the locality [Mataura] for wonderful stories of wonderful beings; the Maories declare that there are hairy giants, who inhabit a mountain near these valleys; they call them Miroroi, and have a great dread of them; we were very anxious to procure a specimen, and quite willing to hazard the capture, thinking it would be a fine spec., other resources failing, to return to England with.
