Quote:  But they are resourceful [220] poachers when they need a fish for the pot. When winter comes, the `Maori season' begins and, the law and the activities of rangers notwithstanding, they consider themselves entitled to take trout when they want them and by the simplest and most effective means - net, spear or pitchfork.
