Quote:  But for all the apparent poverty this is a feel-good documentary where grown men refer to the wives as "Mumsies" and there's more giggling and joshing than a whole series of 'Bro' Town' . . . Uncle Bim is the oldest racer and agrees with the doorman that it's no good partying with the young lads for it upsets the Mumsies and may provoke "the gears being thrown out on the road."
