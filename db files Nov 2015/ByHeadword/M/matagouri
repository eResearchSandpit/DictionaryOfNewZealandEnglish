Quote:  <i>Matagory, n</i>.a prickly shrub of New Zealand, <i>Discaria toumatou</i>, Raoul.; also called <i>Wild Irishman</i> (q.v.). The Maori name is <i>Tumatakuru</i>, of which <i>Matagory</i>, with various spellings, is a corruption, much used by rabbiters and swagmen. The termination <i>gory</i> evidently arises by the law of Hobson-Jobson from the fact that the spikes draw blood.
