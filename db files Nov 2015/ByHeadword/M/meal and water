Quote:  Dipping was hot, thirsty work so we had frequent recourse to the meal and water, staple drink of farmers in the field. Ehtel [sic] made a very good brew; four tablespoons of oatmeal and a little water into a seven pound treacle billy where it was squeezed to a cream with the back of the spoon, and the billy filled water. Wherever we were working in hot weather the `meal 'n water' went too, hanging on the hames or packed on the sledge.
