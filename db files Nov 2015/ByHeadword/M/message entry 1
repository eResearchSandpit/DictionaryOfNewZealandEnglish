Quote:  Under the shop verandahs young boys and girls scorched golden by the heat paraded for each other, and pakeha and Maori children ambled home with their messages and change, wonderfully cool in the shade of slabs of coloured ice on sticks.
Notes:  Jim Cameron says <i>run/go messages</i> is recorded in DNZE but (as a citation shows) phrase and meaning are slightly wider than the definition there, comprehending the shopping itself and what is obtained... Whatever its initial NZ currency the phrase is general NZE and not special to Southland as sometimes suggested.
