Notes: [The word was adopted during WW2, and survived a few years in NZ after, say, 1950, but is now (1984) Italian<i>mangiare</i> etc; perhaps from, or reinforced by, French <i>manger</i> (cf WW1 <i>mungey</i> `food', probably from French). It is unlikely that Maori <i>maanaga</i>, the remains of food (after a meal) influenced the Army use, except perhaps, the sense I given by Partridge, which I have not recorded from elsewhere. It may, however, helped to give the NZ use `a Maori shape', as Partridge says; but I am not aware of Maori <i>maanga</i>ing any currently in NZ English in spite of Davins spelling.]
