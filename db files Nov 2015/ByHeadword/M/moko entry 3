Quote:  <i>Moko, n</i>. the system of tattooing practised by the Maoris. See <i>Tattoo</i>. It is not a fact - as popularly supposed - that the `moko' was distinctive in different families; serving, as is sometimes said, the purpose of a coat-of-arms. The `moko' was in fact all made on the same pattern - that of all Maori carvings. Some were more elaborate than others. The sole difference was that some were in outline only, some were half filled in, and others were finished in elaborate detail.
