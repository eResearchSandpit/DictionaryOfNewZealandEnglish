Quote:  MINNOW or WHITEBAIT (INANGA) <i>Austrocobitis attenuatus</i> (Jenyns)... For a long time it has been known to the Maori and to Europeans that our New Zealand Whitebait is the young of a native freshwater fish commonly known as Minnow, or Inanga or Hiwi to the Maori, and erroneously called a Trout. ... The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.
