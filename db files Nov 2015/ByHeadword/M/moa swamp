Quote:  Little further field activity could be recorded other than continued work in the Pyramid Valley moa-swamp and the demonstration that one of the last of a colony of anomalously surviving `bush' moas (<i>Megalapteryx</i>) had been killed in the Fiordland hinterland of Lake Te Anau, by a Maori fowling party of the eighteenth century.
