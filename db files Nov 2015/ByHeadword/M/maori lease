Quote:  I had already approached the Commissioner of Crown Lands in the early stages of my negotiations and his department had replied that they would favourably consider leasing it to me, but not until I had secured confirmation of the Maori leases, because, if I fell down on the Maori leases, I could make demands on the Crown for roading facilities.
