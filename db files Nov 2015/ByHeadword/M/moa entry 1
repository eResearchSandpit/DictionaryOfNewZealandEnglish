Quote:  The discovery of upland moa bones in a cave in Mt Aspiring National Park paints a picture of the bird's last hours, 2000 years ago. The Otago museum-led expedition was launched last week after hunters last year found an upland moa (Megalapteryx didinus) egg and bones in a cave 1300 metres above sea level in the Humboldt Mountains, northwest of the head of Lake Wakatipu... Upland moa were agile, 1.2 metre-high ostrich-like birds, the New Zealand equivalent of mountain goats.

Quote:  It is now known, for example, that moa were larger during the ice ages, such as the one which peaked 18,.000 years ago, than during warmer times. <i>Pachyornis elephantopus</i>, the heavy-footed moa, was 34 per cent heavier when the ice was down.

Quote:  "The discovery represents a very important step forward for moa research, as few specimens of the upland moa have been found in comparison with lowland species"... Mr Patrick said the upland moa, one of the smaller of the 11 species, would have stood about a metre tall and probably moved to higher altitudes in summer to find food and nest.
