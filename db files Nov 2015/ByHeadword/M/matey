Quote:  One man exclaimed So help me there lies the finest horse that ever crossed the Terahmacow and all echoed him. Another said Matey never own a good horse, another said, Justly you might as well tell an overlander to drown himself at once as ride a bad horse ... Half the township would have shouted for me if I would have drank ... and I was asked all down the river if I was the man that lost a fine horse saying Well mate, I am sorry for you. Fate.
