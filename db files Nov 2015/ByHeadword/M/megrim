Quote:  <i>Caulopsetta scapha</i> Forster. This species referred to as the `brill' in my former list, is a totally different fish. This specific name belongs to the megrim, or witch, a common form, not sold as a food fish on account of its lean, bony character.

Quote:  The `commonest and most widely distributed of the flat fishes of New Zealand, and yet, unfortunately, the least valuable,' is the Megrim or Witch (Plate II. fig. 1). It is our only left sided flat fish, and is a very thin species full of long bones.

All are excellent food fish-again with the exception of the megrim, once dubbed `cadgers' - fish' because of its suitability for palming off on those who hover round landing fishing-craft in the hope of perks, especially flatfish. <i>Ibid.</i> 218 [Caption] Fig. 66: FLATFISHES.

Quote:  Ironically, the most abundant of all New Zealand flounders, the witch or megrim, is useless for eating because of its multitude of long thin hair-like bones and thin watery flesh. The Maori name for this fish - mahue - says it all. It translates as `to be left behind'.
