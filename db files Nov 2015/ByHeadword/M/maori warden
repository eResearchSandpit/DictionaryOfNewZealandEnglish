Quote:  Maori Wardens were appointed in 1949 as a result of the Liquor Licensing Bill 1948. Wardens were administered through the Department of Maori Affairs and nominated by tribal executives. Wardens had power over liquor and liqor-related disturbances within tribal districts, with powers over Maori pub patrons and over Pakeha at hui or if there was sly-grogging... In many ways the Maori wardens were following in the tradition of the Ringatu pirihimana, the Ratana katipa and the Kingite watene.
