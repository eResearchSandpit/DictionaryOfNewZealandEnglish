Quote:  On both sides [of the Southern Alps] grows the sub-alpine vegetation in all its beauty. You may walk knee-deep in Mountain Lilies, you may pick Edelweiss [fn] by the handfull [sic]; the air at a certain season of the year is full of the fragrance of the Alpine Broom [fn 2]. [fn] The Mountain Lily is ... a buttercup, and the Edelweiss does not belong to the same genus as its European namesake.  [fn 2] <i> Carmichaelia grandiflora </i>, var.<i> alba </i>.

Quote:  <i> Ranunculus Lyallii (Lyall's Ranunculus)</i> ... The plant is known to colonists as the Mountain, Shepherd's, or Mount Cook Lily. The name is [167] most inappropriate, as the plant is not a lily, but a large white buttercup. However, any large-leaved herbaceous native plant is called by the colonists a lily, especially if it has white flowers.
