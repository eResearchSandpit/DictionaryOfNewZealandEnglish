Quote:  Most of that time he spent overseas, touring Europe with Maori showbands, working the club circuit in Asia, playing Vegas... The showband era thrived, says Ratana, because there was nothing else offering then. "There was no TV, so you had to entertain people."

Quote:  In the 1960s and 70s, Maori showbands criss-crossed the globe, their names emblazoned in lights above marquees from Las Vegas to London, Hawaii to Hamburg... What was distinctive about Maori showbands, apart from their Maoriness, was the versatility. Members had to be able to mime, dance and do comedy skits as well as sing and play several instruments... But the audience still gets what she describes as the "pure showband" routine, which means frequent instrument and costume changes and lost of comedy (Shirley Bassey and the Bee Gees are favoured spoof subjects) in between the straight songs.
