Quote:  '... Sawing was especially difficult when there was a lot of gum in the tree trunk. The gum became hot from the action of the saw and made the saw blade sticky and hard to drive. The cross-cutters always had a tin of 'madoo', a mixture of kerosene and salt-free fat, which they used to lubricate the blade.'
