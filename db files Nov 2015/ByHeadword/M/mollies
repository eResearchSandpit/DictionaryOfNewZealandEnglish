Quote:  Marbles were the currency of childhood and there were an astonishing number of names for them, some referring to the material or colour, others to value or function in the game. There were agates, aggies, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cats-eye, [sic] chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, mollies, peelies, peewees, pisswees, pretties, Scotties, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers and whities. The march of technology added ball bearings - ballies or steelies - which were unbeatable when it came to smashing an opponent's miserable glassie. World War II[roman] brought `clayeys' often imperfectly spherical they were pathetic terracotta substitutes for real marbles.
