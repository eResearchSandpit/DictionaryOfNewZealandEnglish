Quote:  [Hdg] The quarter-acre section has been replaced by the quarter-acre house that critics are calling the McMansion... This is the official flop of the nation's pavlova paradise, a place where the largest house is erected on the smallest site for the lowest price in the shortest time. The critics call it McMansion land, mock-palaces for the masses... So the McMansion is a trophy house? "It probably is," agrees Halsey.
