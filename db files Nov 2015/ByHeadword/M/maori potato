Quote:   The first permanent European introduction of real consequence to the Bay of Islands was a type of potato, brought by Marion du Fresne's expedition of 1772 and called by the New Zealanders uwhi - the name of one of their own yams. The uwhi potato and other early introduced varieties - known collectively today as `Maori potatoes' although each has its own distinctive name - are still found growing in some home gardens, more especially in the rural areas of the north.

Quote:  By chance in 1984 I received a boole from the International Potato Center at Lima, Peru ... and the cover shows Andean potato cultivars - some very similar to the `Urenika' type. I have speculated that perhaps this similarity provides some support for the notion that lines of the maori potato came to Aotearoa direct from South America and not via Europe.

Quote:  The Maori Potato The ancient potato cultivars commonly referred to as Maori potatoes may be descended from tubers given to the Maori by early explorers, or they may have come direct from South America with the early colonisation of the Pacific. Doug Yen ... now at the Bishop Museum appears to have been the first to collect and study these early potatoes (<i>The Potato Journal summer 1961/61:</i> 2-5) and he refers to the introductions by de Surville in 1769 and 1772 and by Cook in 1773. Yen also refers to the possible introduction direct from South America, since Callao in Peru and Acapulco in Mexico were provisioning ports for whaling vessels. This year I grew `Urenaka' (Yen refers to `Urenika') ... and I understand this cultivar came from the East Coast. It is certainly an unusual potato with purplish stems and tubers. ... Yen ... notes that they resemble the storied (Iodine) potato of Ireland, used as a talisman against illness. ... Audrey [Eagle] said that when she gave some [similar] tubers to a Maori lady she exclaimed `ah, rokekuri'.
