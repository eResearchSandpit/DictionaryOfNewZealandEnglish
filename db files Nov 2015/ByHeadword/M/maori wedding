Quote:  In those days [c1890s] they had what was known as the `Maori wedding', which was not legal to the Pakeha, but was a binding thing among the Maori people themselves. A young couple would decide that they wanted to become man and wife, and they would have to tell their parents they wanted this. Well, at night-time everyone would congregate in the meetinghouse [the matter would be discussed, the boy and girl would be asked whether they wanted to marry, and they would take each other in front of all their people].
