Quote:  [Anderson].. notes that most of the moa-hunting activities occurred south of Cook Strait... He concludes that, although some coastal sites are immense and must represent the slaughter of many thousands of moa, "moa-hunting was generally a temporary, perhaps seasonal, activity" which seldom provided more than a quarter to a half of the moa-hunters' total sustenance... His broad conclusion is that moa-hunting occurred between the 11th and 17th centuries, but peaked early in the 123th century in most areas.
