Quote:  Maori Schools</i> ... The Maori state primary schools (called `native schools' until 1947) were established after 1867 usually in remote, rural, and predominantly Maori communities. The official policy was one of assimilation. The schools provided an English-type education and special instruction in English for Maori children, the majority of whom still spoke Maori as their first language.
