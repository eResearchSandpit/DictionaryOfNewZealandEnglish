Quote:  The verbs <i>to go snaky, to go maggoty</i> (cf U.S. <i>maggoty</i>, whimsical) [mean to show anger or annoyance]. Phrases like `mad as a maggot', `mad as a meat-axe' are obviously linked with these expressions (some though not all of which may be heard in Australia; cf. Australian <i>snake-headed,</i> annoyed); whether <i>mad</i> in the sense of angry is a survival of an English provincialism, or has been introduced from America, is not clear.
