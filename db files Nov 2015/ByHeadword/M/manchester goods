Quote:  Whereas in former times, flax, <i>kumeras</i>, fern roots, snared birds, pigs and shellfish, etc., sufficed for their simple needs, they were now irrecoverably enslaved by wants, tastes and ambitions unfelt by their ancestors, and must have 'tobacco and gunpowder, clothing and blankets, iron pots, agricultural implements, knives and muskets, and Manchester goods.'
Notes:  Quote from R G Jameson, 1841, <i>New Zealand, South Australia, and New South Wales</i>, p. 235.
