Quote:  A second course, modestly listed on Ralph's hand-written menu as Moi Moi Potato Stew and Northland Oysters, in reality proved more elaborate: the oysters had simply been warmed through, but the tiny purple moi moi potatoes had been peeled, cooked, mashed and stuffed inside large tortellini.

Quote:  A common variety, moemoe, means "to sleep", which possibly refers to planting the tubers. Moemoe, which is grown commercially near Pukekohe, is sometimes seen in our better restaurants, such as The White House and The Boulcott Street Bistro... Another dish in Morgan's repertoire.. is to slice moemoe into rounds and cook them in a mixture of half duck fat and half olive oil for 40-60 minutes at 170C.
