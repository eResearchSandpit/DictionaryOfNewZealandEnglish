Quote:   .. he thinks of sickness, particularly that kind of sickness which he calls Maori sickness, as very often caused by spirits as a punishment for the violation of tapu or custom. <i>Ibid.</i> 219 The sign most often taken to indicate this sort of sickness is that the sickness does not appear to be yielding readily to ordinary Maori or to pakeha methods of treatment.
