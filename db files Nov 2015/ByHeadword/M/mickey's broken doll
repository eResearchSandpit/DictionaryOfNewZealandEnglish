Quote:  You think that I've been miking all this while;/ Why I took a chance,/ Left one ball in France,/ And now I'm Mickey's broken doll.
Notes:  1939 This version heard Trentham, according to B.F. Shepherd [Auckland corresp. April 12, 1976] [Les Cleveland's note: The `Mickey' referred to =Michael Joe Savage. So this is a 1939, N.Z. adaption of a W.W.1. song.]
