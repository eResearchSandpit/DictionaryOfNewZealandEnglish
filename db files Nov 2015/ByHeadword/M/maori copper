Quote:  We roasted half a sheep in a Maori copper, that is first dig a hole in the ground in proportion to the thing you want to cook. Line the bottom and sides with stones as big as a breakfast cup then light a fire over them till they are quite red hot throwing in more loose stones to put on the top. Then take out all the ashes, wrap your meat in green grass put it in the pit, throw the loose stones on top and cover the whole with sods of grass, clay or anything that will keep the steam in, three or four hours will cook your meat to perfection.
