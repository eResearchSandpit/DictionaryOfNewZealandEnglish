Quote:  ... The term <i>Maori bunk</i> for a shelf that serves as a common bed for several people is obviously a New Zealand expression and in no doubt due to the Maori habit of having a common sleeping floor. How well known the term is outside tramping circles I do not know, but the device was not unknown in the inns of rural France, I understand.
