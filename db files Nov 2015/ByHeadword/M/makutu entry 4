Quote:  A bus driver was struck on the head ... by a man who claimed he suffered from Makutu [sic], a Maori sickness, the High Court at Auckland was told yesterday. ... He was not insane, ... yet he was mentally unstable ... He had suffered from makutu, a form of mental illness peculiar to Maoris, and its associated personality disorder.
