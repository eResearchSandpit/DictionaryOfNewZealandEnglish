Notes: It seems the trail leads back to Aucklandabout 1924 at earliest, first real exhibition probably 1926; competitions between various factories in the clothing trade. The restrictions on uniforms mentioned below were brought in to prevent big firms outspending the smallones by providing splendiferous uniforms. Organisations outside the rag trade do not seem to have been allowed in officially into Interhouse Marching until about 1954.  Despite the evidence below that it started in Auckland under Jean Stevenson, Bateman's Encyclopedia says marching started in Wellington and spread to Auckland later.  It must be wrong. The plot thickens. Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.

Quote:  Girls' marching as a sport or competition was started in Auckland by Miss Jean Stevenson, General Secretary of the YWCA in Auckland in the early 1920s. The idea was to give some recreation to girls who did not favour the robust sports of hockey or basketball... In due course, marching competitions came to Wellington... You can tell  a marching girl by the way she carries herself - and by the absence of round shoulders... The Wellington Inter-house Marching Association was formed with rules governing costume to allow the participants to take part in running and ball-relay events as well as marching.

Quote:  Despite scurrilous suggestions that marching was an Australian invention, NZ Marching asserts that the sport was introduced to Australia when New Zealand's Grenadier Guards visited there in 1953. It was not until 1977 that trans-Tasman rivals competed in the first inter-dominion championships.
