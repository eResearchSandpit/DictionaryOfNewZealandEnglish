This singular fish (named by Dr. Gu[dieresis]nther <i>Neochanna apoda</i>) is very common in the Hokitika district, being found in all the creeks and surface-ponds in the woods ...On the pools becoming dry these mudfish burrow into the moist soil or clay, ... remaining there for an indefinite time, or until the return of the rainy weather rendered their pools habitable again.
