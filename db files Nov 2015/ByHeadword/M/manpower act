Notes: There seems to be no Manpower Act or Manpower Regulations as such. What we had instead were various amendments to the National Service Emergency Regulations promulgated first in 1940, when they referred mainly to the Services and spoke of Placement Officers and which I suspect were the "Manpower  Regulations" of the time.  The first relevant regulation seems to be 1942 Statutory Regulations 5/19 The National Service Emergency Regulations 1940, Amendment No. 8: There shall from time to time be appointed.. such number of District Man-power Officers as may be required. Ibid. 21. In any essential undertaking.. (a) Except with the permission in writing of the District Man-power Officer, the employer shall not terminate.. the employment of any person for the time being employed therein.. except in case of emergency... (b) Except with the permission in writing of the District Man-power Officer, no person for the time being employed in the undertaking shall leave his employment... Ibid. 24. The Minister may.. direct all persons of any specified class or of specified classes.. to register for employment with the District Man-power Office.
