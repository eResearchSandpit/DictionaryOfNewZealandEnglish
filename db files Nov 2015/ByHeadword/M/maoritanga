Quote:  There is no doubt that more than the spirit which pervades our people on development work ..., what impressed the Tokerau delegates last year when they visited those districts was the `maoritanga' of the tribes inhabiting that part of the Eastern Maori electorate. It was not a maoritanga of the lips as among the Waikato, but was manifested in persistent cultural traits, carvings, plaiting, marae ceremonial, poetry and song, speech and so forth.

Quote:  To a certain extent, in fact, <i>Maoritanga</i> is not a matter of inheritance; it is a matter of <i>he manawa</i>, of `how one feels.' <i>Ibid.</i> 75 But when Sir James Carroll and other leaders of the Young Maori Party wanted a term to denote the way of life of their people, they took the completely-assimilated modern meaning of the word `Maori' - which, thanks to the <i>pakeha</i>, transcended tribal boundaries - and coined a new meaning for `Maoritanga.' The meaning of the term is debated and discussed, analyzed and defined, used and abused with great frequency in the present upsurge of interest in Maori culture and traditional ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. A second Maori renaissance seems to be under way, aided by this all-embracing term and strengthened by the success of the first one in the early decades of this century.

Quote:  The keynote to Maoritanga is the fact that the Maori race has distinct racial personality, and what we have come to term Maoritanga is the expression of that distinctive racial personality in language, poetry and art, customs and usage, rite and ceremony, work and play.

Quote:  Then they get restless, they want to be somewhere else, they've had Maoritanga for the time being, thank you, and yet if you happen to be among a group of people at a function you hear the same people holding forth about having 'been on the marae' and how wonderful it is.
