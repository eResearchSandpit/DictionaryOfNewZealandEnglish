Quote:  By nine o'clock everybody is absolutely mullocked. The combination of the alcohol, the soothing paint, the aggressive bar staff who get the adrenalin going everytime you go up to the bar and the boring conversation is enough to make any person a babbling drooling uncontrolled mess.

Quote:  Alvin's letter to Chaff (Alvin being the Massey student who wrote "firetrucks are cool"), was not as harmless as it appeared. "Your 'happy' letter writer Alvin was not referring to the big red firetrucks one sees driving round town," she

wrote. "Firetrucking", male student style, is the practice.. of getting so hideously mullocked that control of the bladder is lost. A wet patch on the front and legs of the trousers ensues. This is the signal that a firetruck has occurred."
