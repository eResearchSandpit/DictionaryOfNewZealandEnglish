Quote:   [It was a] harder [matter] still to light a fire and cook the four magpies we had shot on the road [near Cascade, Southern Alps]. [ed fn] This reference is obscure. Australian magpies

(Gymnorhina) were introduced into New Zealand in 1864 in Canterbury, but it is rather unlikely that any of the introduced [410] birds should be at Cascade in that year. But Barrington had been in Australia and should have known magpies well.
