Quote:  I called nearly everything a <i>faquement</i> (which name, by the way, I never yet saw in print, and cannot attempt to define); I protested on the authority of <i>my colonial oath</i>; learned to <i>plant</i> anything I wished to preserve; to <i>blow</i> about the <i>hammerings</i> I had given to men, whom I should not have dared to have touched with the end of a barge pole; to <i>finance</i> at cards whenever it was feasible; to give <i>fits</i> to whoever opposed me in discussions; and swear a <i>hurricane</i> if anything crossed my temper.
