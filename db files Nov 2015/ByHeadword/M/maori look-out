Quote:  `Where to?' `Over to the Maori look-out. ...' ... The Maori look-out was a point just beyond the western arm of the bay, a jagged and rock-strewn cliff patchy with native bush. ... In

the days when only Maoris lived there, on a hill-top pa behind the beach, they used the point to watch for enemy war-canoes travelling across the harbour. Scouts planted there would give warning of an attack.
