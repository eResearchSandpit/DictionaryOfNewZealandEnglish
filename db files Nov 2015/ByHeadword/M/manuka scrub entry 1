Quote:  Manuka scrub, of which there is a patch of from 20,000 to 30,000 acres on the north bank of the Courtenay, can be turned to good account by the residents in its neighbourhood for fencing purposes and fuel. Its leaves are a tolerable substitute for tea, and it possesses considerable astringent properties.

Quote:  <i>ma[a]nuka,</i> a shrub (Leptospermum scoparium), commonly called tea-tree, because Cook's people used the fresh young leaves infused for tea; but very often mis-spelt ti-tree - ti being something totally different, the cabbage tree (Cordyline). The tree-manuka is kanuka, with smaller leaves and smaller flowers than the scrub-manuka, and it is the kanuka that is usually sold for firewood.
