Quote:  8. `the meeting-house'. Meeting houses have often been the focus of community effort and pride. They are long halls used for meetings and for the accommodation of visitors. They have a verandah at the entrance with a carved gabled front and are richly decorated inside, with patterned reed panels, with black and white painted scrolls on the rafters, and with carvings or paintings of ancestors and incidents in the mythological history of the people on whose marae the meeting-house is built. Supporting the ridge-pole is a centre-post on which are figures of ancestors. The floor is often covered with flax matting, and visitors take off their shoes before entering. Another meeting house is described in the first part of `Hemi's Daughter'.

Quote:  In those days [c1890s] they had what was known as the `Maori wedding', which was not legal to the Pakeha, but was a binding thing among the Maori people themselves. A young couple would decide that they wanted to become man and wife, and they would have to tell their parents they wanted this. Well, at night-time everyone would congregate in the meetinghouse [the matter would be discussed, the boy and girl would be asked whether they wanted to marry, and they would take each other in front of all their people].

Quote:  Wood used for carving and building carries with it the spirit of the tree, the spirit of place including the name of the place, and the spirit of the carvers who create the powerful images of tribal ancestors which decorate wharenui (meeting houses). ... Anyone who has spent time in a carved house (wharenui) will know the depth of feeling the carvings evoke, for they make the wharenui a living thing.

In a literal sense the term means the open courtyard in front of the communal meeting house; today ... it embraces all aspects of community life - community buildings, tribal gatherings, church activities, and recreation.
