Quote:  <i>weka</i>, a ground-bird (Ocydromus sp.), wood-hen, Maori hen; it has wings, but too small for flight, but it can dodge and run well; and whilst its long toes are unwebbed it swims well, and voluntarily takes to the water to investigate distant isles in the great lakes: a most inquisitive and amusing bush-companion, and a courageous mother.
