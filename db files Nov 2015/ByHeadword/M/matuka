Quote:  The fact that large, wet flies tied in a particular way to imitate small fish are known by three different names causes a lot of confusion. In America, England and elsewhere they are called `streamer' flies; in New Zealand they are called `matukas'; in Australia, `longtails'. As patterns from all three countries are used here, the confusion can be understood. If the angler remembers why each name is used, the confusion disappears. ... / The word `matuka', as used for the New Zealand patterns, is the name of a bird (now protected) whose feathers were first used to tie this kind of wet fly.
