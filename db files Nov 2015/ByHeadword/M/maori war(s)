Quote:  Most people have heard of the great battles of what used to be called the "Maori Wars", such as Rangiriri and Orakau, which were both fought in the Waikato campaign... But in the end, the British army was just too strong for Maori in what is now generally known as the "New Zealand Wars."

Quote:  THE MOUNTED RIFLEMAN [title] New Zealanders in these regions are popularly referred to, in their Homeland, as `The Mounteds"; and as being indicative of their pecularities in method of warfare, the term has its value. In origin, the Mounted Riflemen date back to the 'sixties, when that fine soldier, Major Sir Harry Atkinson, formed the settler-riflemen into a mounted force of a nature demanded by the topographical and tactical conditions of the fiercely-contested Maori wars.
