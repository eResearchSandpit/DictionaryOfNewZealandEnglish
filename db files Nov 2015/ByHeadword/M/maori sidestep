Quote:  The term `Maori sidestep' was made during the instant re-play of Stone's first-half try, which ended with a powerful, barging dive at the line. Mr Wallace complained that commentator Grant Nisbett described it as `the famous Maori sidestep' while others attribute the remark to Grahame Thorne. Mr Wallace said: `To me that comment means Maoris do not take the peaceful way, or sidestep, they bully their way through anything.'
