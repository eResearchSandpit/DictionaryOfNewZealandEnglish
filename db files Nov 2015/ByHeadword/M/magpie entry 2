Quote:  <i>Magpies, the</i> the Hawke's Bay provincial rugby team, from their black and white playing colours, remembered fro their glorius Ranfurly Shield era of the 1920, which began with beating Otago in 1921 and continued until they lost to Wairarapa in 1927. The total of 25 successful defences was a record until Auckland took over in the 1980s.
