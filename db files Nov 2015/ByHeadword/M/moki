He's been calling on the Waitangi Tribunal and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to protect the moki fishery. But.. the moki grounds haven't produced big catches or an abundant winter harvest since the early 1970s. <i>Ibid.</i> 88 A secret to eating moki is that there is a green bile in it which makes the body sour unless it is drained out of the mouth, by hanging the fish by its tail.
