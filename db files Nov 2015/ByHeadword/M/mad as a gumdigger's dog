Quote:  Where do the sayings "Mad as a gum-digger's dog", "mad a a meat axe" and "Mad as a cut snake" come from? asks Barry Wheaton of Hobsonville... In New Zealand, from the mid-19th century, gumdiggers grubbed a living retrieving fossil kauri gum from the land and their dogs were often disparaged as skinny, useless or mad.
