Quote:  While miengin (pronounced mine-gin) was introduced to New Zealand five years ago, it only hit Wellington's speciality stores this year... It is a product made from the gluten component of wheat. Flour is soaked and the white starchy part is washed away leaving an elastic malleable dough which can be shaped, textured and flavoured.
