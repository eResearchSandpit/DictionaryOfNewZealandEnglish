Quote:  ... long list of timber trees whose fine stems are almost all disfigured with rank parasites. One of these parasites, the red myrtle, winding in and [ampersand] out of its patron becomes itself an enormous tree stifling the original growth ...[sic] as the first tree rots from its grasp. It is covered in season with lovely scarlet and [ampersand] gold flowers in shape like those of the English myrtle.
