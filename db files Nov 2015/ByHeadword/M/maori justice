Quote:  When I first read about this sadistic person's crimes, I said to family members that if true "Maori justice" still prevailed, he and his associates would have got a fast exit from this world a long time ago. ... Instead of these misfits causing misery to the rest of us conformists, perhaps we should reinstate true "Maori justice".
