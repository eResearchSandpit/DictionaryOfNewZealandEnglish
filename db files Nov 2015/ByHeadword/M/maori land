Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The legal definition of Maori land in DNZE is confusing. <i>Maori customary land</i> is land held in accordance with tikanga Maori. <i>Maori freehold land</i> is essentially (there are minor qualifications) land that has been converted to English freehold tenure and has not been alienated to non-Maori. There are several trusts for various forms of Maori landholding - <i>ahi whenua trusts, kitiakai trusts, putea trusts, whanau trusts</i> and <i>whenua topu trusts</i>. Note also <i> status orders</i>. See Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993.

Quote:  Never once do I remember hearing [in Tauranga in the 1930s] about the confiscation of Maori land although the name `the Quarter Acres' for an area of town sections allotted to Pakeha after the Battles of Gate Pa and Te Ranga (1864) was commonly used.

Quote:  Maori land and the terms relating to it are of course unique to New Zealand. DNZE defines it (in part) as land for which Maori customary or legal title is recognised as valid. This has a circular air and the contrast of customary and legal tile is confusing, since customary title is itself a title recognised by the law.  At law, Maori land is land owned by Maori under customary or Maori freehold title.
