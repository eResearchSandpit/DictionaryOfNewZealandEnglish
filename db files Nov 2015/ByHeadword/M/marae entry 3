Quote:  We have before now observed on several parts of the Coast small Villages inclosed with Pallisades, and Works of this kind built on eminences and ridges of hills, but Tupia hath all along told us that they were Mories or places of Worship, but I rather think that they are places of retreat or Stronghold. [cf gloss; `fortified village' Nov 4 1/193]
