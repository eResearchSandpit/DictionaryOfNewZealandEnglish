The Speaker, Peter Tapsell, came to Banks' defence, pointing out that both Maori and pakeha working in his shearing shed regularly used the term and that Banks' use of it had not harmed race relations.

Quote:  In New Zealand the word <i>Maori</i> sometimes enters into slang with contemptuous connotation but there is a good-natured tolerance, even tinged with envy for an admirable adjustment to life's problems, in a term like <i>Maori P.T.</i> (from the army P T = physical training) to mean lying down and doing nothing, what the Australian calls <i>spinebashing. </i>

Quote:  The complaint to the [Race Relations Conciliator] was in one sense rightly made because `Maori time' belongs to a whole genre of derogatory sayings which include such negative ones as `Maori day off', "Maori PT', Maori car', etc.

Quote:   Brown and white there were no differences between the colours then [in WW2]. The happy members of the 28th Battalion referred to themselves as `horis' (I've never known what the word meant, but now to use it is as big an insult as for a white to be called a Pakeha), and spoke of `Maori time' (some time) and `Maori PT' (lying on one's bedroll) and we followed their lead, not knowing that they, and we, were using such appallingly insulting terms to the Maori race that a special Race Relations Conciliator would have to be installed to quell them.
