Quote:  For a lamb, an ME of 8.5 is maintenance level. No matter what else you do, if the ME of your pasture is 8.5, lambs won't grow. Even if your ME is at a good level, your stocking rate must be optimum.

Quote:  Although bales now come in all shapes and sizes, the product inside is what counts. Quality is measured in the percentage of ME - metabolisable energy, which the cow can convert to milk solids .. It costs just as much to harvest low quality feed as good, and the cows need to eat more, so the cost is higher with a lower ME crop.
