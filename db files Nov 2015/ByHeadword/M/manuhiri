Quote:  <i>Sponsoring the manuhiri</i> [heading] Have you ever thought about what is involved in sponsoring a refugee? ... The theme for this year's refugee Sunday is `many manuhiri'. The manuhiri are the `people coming in', and New Zealand has a tradition of welcoming strangers that goes back to the very first people who settled here. More recently, New Zealanders have continued that tradition and established an international reputation for their refugee resettlement programme.
