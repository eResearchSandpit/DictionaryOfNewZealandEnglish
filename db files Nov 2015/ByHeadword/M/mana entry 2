Quote:  Mana - `prestige' - but actually much more than this. It includes charisma, power, control and influence. People can accrue mana by means of birth, leadership qualities increasingly shown, knowledge, and the ability to increase the prestige of all things Maori. Increasing age may bring mana. It is earned, though sometimes given by a group to someone or to a tribe beacause of actions deemed to be worthy of them. Loss of mana is a loss of one's dignity and sense of worth. Total loss of mana could mean loss of life's meaning.

They replied `Ae', again. <i>Ibid.</i> 17 Another object aimed at is the preservation of what they call the `mana' of the Chiefs. This word means authority, power, influence. <i>Ibid.</i> 18 [inherent in land] `Kia mau te mana o te whenua' is another expression now in frequent use, i.e., `hold fast the mana of the land'. ... This is altogether a new application of the term; perhaps it has ben adopted in consequence of the Queen's Sovereignty over the Island having been translated as the Queen's mana. But it certainly did not originally mean that which is now claimed for it, viz., a Chief's `manorial right'. This use of the word was not heard until this Maori King movement originated it.

It <i>was</i> Maori land then; but, alas! what is it now? Success to you, O King of Waikato. May your

Virtus, prestige,</i> authority, good fortune, influence, sanctity, luck, are all words which, under certain conditions, give something near the meaning of <i>mana</i>, though not one of them gives it exactly; but before I am done, the reader shall have a reasonable notion (for a pakeha) of what it is.
