Quote:  Behind Toutuki, [the prospective Otago settler] may explore the mountain dreaded by the natives, on account of its being the favourite residence of the mairoero. This is a wild man of the woods, strong, cunning, and mischievous, and addicted to running off with young people and damsels. His body is covered with coarse and long hair, which also flows down from the back of his head nearly to his heels. To com-[263]pensate for this excessive quantity behind, his forehead is said to be bald. He was vividly described to us by a Maori who had seen one long ago, when he was a little boy, and was of opinion that `there is not a more fearful wild-fowl that your <i>mairoero</i> living.'
