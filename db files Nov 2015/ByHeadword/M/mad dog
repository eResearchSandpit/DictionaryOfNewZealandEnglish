Quote:  [Caption] Richard Prebble was once caricatured as 'Mad Dog Prebble', but colleagues agree he has mellowed over the years... Political cartoonists loved him. That was during the era when he earned the nickname Mad Dog. A few flourishes of the pen and there was Richard Prebble - a crazed canine, confined to a dog collar, mouth bared in a wild snarl.
