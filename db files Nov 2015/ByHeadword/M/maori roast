Quote:  This delicacy of the English-speaking world is referred to in other circles as `shark and taties', `Maori roast', or `greasies' - understanding all depends on knowing the convention. Once the convention is established, it is just a matter of stating one's preference for two meat patties and a scoop, over a stuffed frankfurter.
