Quote: If a man isn't `up to the mark' he is called `a regular shicer!' This phrase originated from the gold diggings. Supposing a man is digging, but without success, and he therefore abandons his hole, it is called a `shicer' - that is, the <i>ground</i> was called a `shicer' or duffer, thus the origin.
