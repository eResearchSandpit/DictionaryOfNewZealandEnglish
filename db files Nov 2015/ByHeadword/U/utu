Quote: [preface] Some explanation of the title, which, to persons living outside Maoriland, may appear as incomprehensible as it is odd, is perhaps called for ... Most born New Zealanders, whether fair or dark, have some conception of the meaning of the word UTU, albeit, to pakeha ears it toofrequently conveys nothing more than a hazy idea of money compensation. ...  Practically, utu meant payment. The ancient Maori did nothing for nothing ...  No man could accept service or gifts without requital and retain the esteem of his fellows; still less could he allow injuries to pass unavenged. Utu (value) he expected for the presents he made; utu (payment) he required for goods or produce; utu (satisfaction) he exacted from hereditary foes and all whom he conceived [?had] injured him. A vendor [?in] the early days of settlement, would request UTU for his produce; a settler desiring to purchase would enquire in his pidgin Maori, `How muchee te utu?' From this milder meaning, expressive of compensation and commodities exchanged, comes the pakeha use of the word signifying money. In settler's parlance `Kahore ti [?] utu' means `I have no money', for to their ears utu is synonymous with `tin', `sugar', and other slang terms used to denote our medium of exchange.
