Quote: He has always understood "uplift" to mean a sort of moral or spiritual inspiration, with unrelated technical meanings such as "raise" for geological formations and support from a  garment for a woman's bust. Our usage in the sense of picking up documents from a council office or goods from a warehouse or storage shed does seem peculiar to New Zealand.
