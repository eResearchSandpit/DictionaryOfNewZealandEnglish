Quote: The full official title is Electric Multiple Unit, often shortened to Multiple Unit, or to Electric Unit (the latter also obtains in general popular usage). The `unit' is actually a motor-coach with one or two trailer-coaches attached. Depending on traffic, gradients, etc. up to three of these `units' can be put together under one driver to form, say, a nine-car train.  The concept is well known in railways management and is practised overseas, both with electric and diesel units. But the word unit seems to have surfaced as the popular name only in New Zealand (cf. Londoners' use of  tube), and only for electric units, not, e.g., for multiple diesel railcars, or in Christchurch, for tram-cars when they were designed to run as units.  Units were introduced to the Wellington-Johnsonville line in 1938; then to the Wellington-Paekakariki line in 1946; and a few years later to the heavily-used Hutt Valley line. The word came into popular usage (e.g. `I'm off to catch the unit.') probably c1939-40.
