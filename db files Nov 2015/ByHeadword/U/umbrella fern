Compare umbrella plant. [OED2 10 b. denoting `shaped like, resembling an umbrella'. Both cits NZ] [JD notes: Brownsey 1989 follows some botanists elsewhere in splitting <i>Gleichenia</i> into three divisions (1) <i>Gleichenia</i> for <i>G. dicarpa (=circinata)</i> and <i>G. microphylla</i> called  `tangleferns'; (2) <i>Sticherus cunninghamii</i> and <i>S. flabellatus</i>  called `umbrella ferns'; and (3) <i>Dicranopteris linearis</i> for  which he gives no common name. `Umbrella ferns' could be taken to refer to all of them.]  Umbrella fern takes numerous descriptive sub-epithets alpine, bog,  bush, climbing, fan(-like), forest, forked, mountain, scrambling,  swamp

Among herbs, sedges and the umbrella fern (<i>Gleichenia circinata</i>) are prominent. [253: fn 80] Kumarahou flowers rubbed together with water form a sort of lather.
