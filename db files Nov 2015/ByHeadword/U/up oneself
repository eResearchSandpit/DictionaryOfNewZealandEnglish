Quote: up himself: In practice this refers to someone who has a severely EXAGGERATED IDEA of his own IMPORTANCE (and/or qualifications, intelligence, etc. etc.). It derives from the suggestions that someone with such narcissistic tendencies could find only himself worthy of his own concupiscent attentions.
