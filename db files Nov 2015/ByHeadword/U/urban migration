Quote: First came the Maori people sometime between the 8th and 14th centuries in  great seaward migrations across the Pacific Ocean... The Maori in effect became an under-class...  The final social transformation came in the 1940s and 50s with the import of American cultural and economic dominance - the automobile, urban migration, urban sprawl and a consumer culture.

Quote: At present, on the one hand, there is one Maori in town for every three in the country: on the other hand, there are two Europeans in town for every one in the country. The distribution of European population represents the real distribution of available jobs. The urban migration of the Maori in search of work will go on till their distribution nearly coincides with that of the Pakeha.
