Quote: ... milch cows, and heifers ready to be broken in for milking. [fn] A friend tells me the expression `breaking in' requires explanation. ... A young cow [allowed to run wild] when first milked is generally `baled up', that is, her head is secured between upright posts so that she can raise or lower it, but cannot turn round to use her horns. ... A pint or less of milk is considered a satisfactory result of the first attempt to milk an `unbroken heifer'. When a cow has submitted to this process a few times without much struggling, she is considered to be `well broken in to milk'.
