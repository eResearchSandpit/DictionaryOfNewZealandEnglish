In the first place, what is a `gum' tree, and why should a friend of yours be up it ? ... If you were to ask me the reason behind the term `gum tree' you would catch me flat-footed. ....

But one thing is certain; the word gum, as nailed on to these trees, has nothing to do with what you are asked to take your change in .... In Australia and New Zealand .... a person up a gum tree is in some kind of trouble .... The expression `up a gum tree' has spread beyond the Pacific; I believe  it is sometimes used in England.
