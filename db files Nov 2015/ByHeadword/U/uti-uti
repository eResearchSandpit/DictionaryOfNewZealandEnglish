Quote: Since the variety known as the "Waina" came into possession of the Natives they have gradually discarded most of the others with the exception of a few varieties such as the Unti-uti, Taromahoe and Rekamaroa, the other kinds being mostly small, rough, and irregularly shaped, and light croppers.
