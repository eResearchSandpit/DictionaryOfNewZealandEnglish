Quote: There are countless ways of preparing food Maori style, but basically there were only three ways of cooking it. The first, which involves steaming in a subterranean oven called an umu or hangi, is known as tao cooking. It was the preferred method of cooking for groups of people, from family size up, in a village setting.
