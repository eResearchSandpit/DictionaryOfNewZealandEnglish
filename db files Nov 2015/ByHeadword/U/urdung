Notes: Mr Shepherd writes 29/06/1999 : During 1987-1990 I chaired a committee seeking a by-pass for Whangarei's northern suburb of Kampo, & started using "urdung" to describe the effluent emanating from stock-trucks as they progressed through the shopping centre. I was surprised to discover that the word soon began appearing in official transport documents, a contraction of urine and dung.
