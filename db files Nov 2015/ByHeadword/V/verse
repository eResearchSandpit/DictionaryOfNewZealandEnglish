Quote: Schoolboy rugby is reported to have given us the charming neologism "versing". Cameron Williamson writes that his nine-year old son's mates are in the habit of bursting in through the back door, yelling, "Who are we versing on Saturday?" When they look up the draw to see which club is to play "versus" whom, attention is likely to turn to Gameboy or Playstation, in which contestants are locked in battle, "versing" each other to death.
