Quote: On 1 February 1851 the V hut is mentioned. It was a roof without walls. The poet's corner on this day celebrated `a land of our own' but probably meant a separate land rather than a land belonging to the newcomers: `We may still be her sons in a land of our own.'

Quote: You would laugh if you saw the place from which I am writing. It is a little `plank tent' or `V. hut', as a thing made of long boards leaning against each other is indiscriminately called; its locality is the side of a small wood, by which runs a clear stream, on the plain, about ten miles from Lyttelton.

Quote: One of the makeshifts [sc houses in early Christchurch] is a simple structure, being like the roof of a high-peaked house placed on the ground. It is called a `V-hut', because, I presume, it is like that letter, inverted; but it does very well for a bachelor to start with.

Quote: Many of the first habitations were of the most primitive description, some being composed  simply of slanting sides, meeting in a peak at the top, in the form of an inverted V, and thence called V-huts. They were constructed of wood, mud, boughs of trees, or anything that came to hand.
