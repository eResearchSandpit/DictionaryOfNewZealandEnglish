Definition:a) a populated area in the country, which is smaller than a town. b) its inhabitants. c) in New Zealand a shopping centre; the centre of a rural town, or a cluster of shops outside the centre of a city. -->[AND 1. obs a small (rural) settlement 1803-1907 2. a cluster of aboriginal dwellings] often with def. art. THE VILLAGE, a modern usage (to be distinguished from the occasional very early British usage of emigrants), orig. deprecatingly and mainly humorously of a township or settlement by those living in the countryside outside its boundaries, or by semi-permanent residents (e.g. week-enders, bachers, etc). For example, Paraparaumu `beach' residents (once mainly a weekend population) refer to the original township on the main road as `The Village' and have done so since at least 1941; similarly for Johnsonville, originally a town, now a suburb of Wellington: their rugby supporters would call (c1950s) `Come on the village!'; the Taupo township (now near-city) was in the 1960s referred to by the large seasonal lakeside holiday population at least as Taupo village. -->The usage was probably fairly popular by at least 1940, and is now common, often being transferred to, for example, the `down-town' or shopping area of  a city by those living in the suburbs (e.g. `Are you coming into the village tonight to the pictures?'); or, specifically, of shopping areas, and now custom-built shopping-complexes in the suburbs (e.g. `You go up Karori Road past the first village, and just before you come to the second, turn off right ...'; or ``Marsden Village' is the name of the recently-opened shopping area in Karori.')

Quote: "Give it to Willy!" was a popular cry at Petone last Saturday. Wallace's line-kicking from the many free-kicks given against the village team must have ruffled pretty considerably the feelings of their admirers.

Quote: Being a Village Man at Petone was to be connected to a web of families, neighbourhoods and sports clubs that provided a great deal of stability for working-class families in the Hutt Valley when it was a hive of industry until the 1970s. Such was the solidarity of Village People with the rugby club, for example, that t was not unknown for some families to draw their blinds whenever the senior team lost a game.
