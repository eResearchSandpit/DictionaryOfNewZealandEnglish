Quote: "It will be agreed by all medical authorities that the speed at which successive draughts of alcohol are consumed is a more potent factor in conducing to inebriacy than the actual quantity taken, and if some means could be devised whereby the concentrated 'vertical swilling' which now takes place could be avoided a reduction in drunkenness would inevitably follow.   The system of bar parlours such as obtain in English and the Continent are designed to discourage this objectionable vertical drinking, but it would seem to be unavoidable if the bulk of the public are obliged to satisfy their requirements between 5 and 6 p.m."
