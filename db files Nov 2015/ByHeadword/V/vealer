Quote: Calves not kept for the herd become bobby calves, a truly standard word since it was defined in  the Bobby Calf Marketing  Regulations in the New Zealand Statutory Regulations, 1938: `Bobby calf' means a calf which is intended for slaughter for human consumption as boneless veal.' Theorigin and dating of the word are doubtful. There is a similar word poddy calf for a hand-fed calf, recorded in Australia from last century. The present New Zealand meaning seems to have arisen about 1929.
