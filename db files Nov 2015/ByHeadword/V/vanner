Quote: Vanners: Concentrating machines used at Waikino before the introduction of Wilfley tables. At  one stage there were twenty-eight vanners and one Wilfley table in use. Although all the vanners were done away with, the large building which later housed twenty-nine Wilfley tables continued to be known as the vanner shed.
