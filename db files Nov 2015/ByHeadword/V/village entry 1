Quote: In Wellington, used of the shopping area(s) in Karori, and occasionally in Ngaio, but there I think it means the whole suburb.  Until c1933 I had never heard  village used in New Zealand - always town, township, or settlement. In 1953 i heard it from one or two who were English, or who had travelled in England and affected English ways. I have heard it recently used by New Zealanders born and bred referring to small townships, but they do not sound at home with it and use it in default of a better word. It may come in.
