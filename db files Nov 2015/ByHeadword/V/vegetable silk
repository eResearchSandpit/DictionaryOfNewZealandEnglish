[12]/ Thin folds of *vegetable silk, behind,/ Shade her white neck, and wanton in the wind;/ Strange sweets, where'er she turns, perfume the glades,/ And fruits unnam'd adorn the bending shades. [fn] Vegetable silk.- In New Zealand is a flax of which the natives make their nets and cordage

Samarang is an East India vegetable silk of extremely elastic fibre, which, owing to its peculiar nature has never been known to attract any kind of insect life.
