Quote: On that morning the open country stretched away in vast fields of fern, and Nature reigned supreme. It is fern-clad now no longer, but green fields gladden the eye; the white gleam of the farmer's homestead dots the landscape, there are villas on the height, and cottages on the shore.

Quote: The average New Zealand villa or cottage is a square box, with a four to six foot passage, pretentiously called a `hall', running through it from front to back. On either side of this, arranged with all a Scotch gardener's love of symmetry, are sitting-room, dining-room, bedrooms and  kitchen ... the evolutionary starting point of the New Zealand villa must have been the tin-lined packing case in which the pioneer settler imported his goods and chattels.

Quote: ... in South Christchurch a cottage meant a box of two or four rooms and a lean-to at the back. But a villa meant something different. It meant six to eight rooms, it meant high ceilings and verandahs, it meant cast iron curlicues and fancy french[sic] cuts. It meant bay windows, bowwindows.

Quote: The villa is a strange contraption, the work of 19th-century building companies enraptured with the possibilities of mass production... Villas are loved and despised in about equal numbers. Two groups for whom the villa has always worked well are flatting students, where everyone has a room of their own and a communal space for meals, and Polynesian families, where the number of people in a house is often in flux... Met with city regulations that required villa-ness and a family to whom the soon-to-be-demolished villa remained well-suited. Walker responded by taking the villa concept apart and re-assembling it as a contemporary home... To the rear are the kitchen and living spaces, now interconnected and made open to a deck - that contemporary re-think of the traditional verandah.
