Quote: Flattish rock surfaces near mid-tide levels are the usual station for such well-known seaweeds as the SEA BOMB, SEA CACTUS, VENUS' NECKLACE, or PURPLE LAVER. <i>Ibid.</i> 9 To this end VENUS' NECKLACE has water-filled, swollen internodes; and the sea bomb is also filled with water [to prevent desiccation]. The existence of this water is known to most children, who call the plant the WATER SQUIRT.
