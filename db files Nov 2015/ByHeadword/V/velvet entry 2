Quote: Hawke's Bay Today Oct 31. 15 The National Velveting Standards Body, which runs the certification scheme, has sent out a blunt warning that farmers who do not comply risk being suspended, thus losing the right to velvet their own deer. Any velveter who does not complete one or more of the requirements by the due dates will not be allowed to velvet next season.
