Quote: The organisation grew out of a meeting at Victoria University on March 30, 1962, hosted by the NZ University Students Association, which was then sponsoring a limited volunteer scheme involving students. A wide range of government, educational and community service groups offered their support, and VSA was formed in September under the chairmanship of the university's Professor Colin Aikman.
