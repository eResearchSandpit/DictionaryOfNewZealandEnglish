Quote: `In Melbourne there is the `verandah'; in Sandhurst there is a `verandah'; in Ballaarat [check spg???] there is a `verandah.' The verandah is a kind of open exchange - some place on the street pavement, apparently selected by chance, on which the dealers in mining shares do congregate.'

Quote: Verandah, n.  In Australia, the heat of the sun makes verandahs much commoner than in England. They are an architectural feature of all dwelling houses in suburb or in bush, and most City shops, where they render the broad side-walks an almost continuous arcade. `Under the Verandah' has acquired the meaning, `where city men most do congregate.'

Quote: `I expect that's why all the shops have verandahs on them - I'd not thought of that. To stop the sun fading the goods through [13] the glass. I thought it was to keep shoppers from getting wet in the rain. It was the first difference I noticed. That, and the lack of bowler hats. I haven't seen a single one since we came to Dunedin. Or one man carrying an umbrella. It's all soft hats or bare hds, isn't it? And they don't need gamps with the verandahs.' [a resent arrival in Dunedin from Britain speaks]
