Quote: The distribution company has issued staff with walkman-like wireless computers which use voice commands and headphones to tell forklift operators and pickers where to go and what to pick up from shelves for transport... Mr Drinkwater says the voice-picking system has exceeded expectations in reducing consignment handling errors.... Since we brought voice-picking online, our error rate has dropped  from 2-3 per cent to less than 0.5 per cent.
