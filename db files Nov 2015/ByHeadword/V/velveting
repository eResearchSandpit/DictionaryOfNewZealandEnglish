Quote: Hawkes Bay Today June 1. 27 Approximately 1500 velveting stags graze on Warwick Kent's Western Hawke's Bay property. He bought the property in the mid-90s and tuned it from a drystock farm into the successful velveting business. In addition to the velveting operation, about 200 steers are finished on the property and wintered in the forestry lease. As of May 2001, livestock included about 1500 velveting stags, 200 two-year-old steers, 1500 mixed-age ewes and 100 goats.
