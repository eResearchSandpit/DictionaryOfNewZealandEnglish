Quote: Amongst the damp moss at the root of the rata trees, in the shady forests not far from Auckland,and also in various parts of the Northern Island, are found those extraordinary productions called vegetable caterpillars - the hotete of the natives. In appearance, the caterpillar differs but little from that of the common privet sphinx-moth, after it has descended to the ground previously to its undergoing the change into the chrysalis state. But the most remarkable characteristic of the vegetable caterpillar is, that every one has a very curious plant, belonging to the fungi tribe, growing from [292] the .us;anus; this fungi varies from three to six inches in length, and bears at its extremity a blossom-like appendage, somewhat resembling a miniature bulrush, and evidently derives its nourishment from the body of the insect. This caterpillar, when recently found, is of the substance of cork; and it is discovered by the natives seeing the tips of the fungi, which grow upwards. They account for this phenomenon by asserting that the caterpillar, when feeding upon the rata-tree overhead, swallows the seeds of the fungus, which take root in the body of the insect, and germinate as soon as it retreats to the damp mould beneath, to undergo its transformation into the pupa state. Specimens of these vegetable caterpillars have been transmitted to naturalists in England, by whom they have been named  Sphoeria Robertii.[check spgs ??? see under

Quote: The term `vegetable caterpillar' is a corruption of the old name of `vegetating caterpillar', by which Sphoeria was called forty or fifty years ago by those colonists who then took interest inscientific matters and which properly describes the curiosity as a caterpillar which apparently develops into or produces a plant. I think it is a pity that our Transactions should be disfigured by a vulgar corruption, however common.

This pest is better known as the `vegetable caterpillar' from afungus that grows from it after death. <i>Ibid.</i> 259 Soot for use as colouring matter for tattooing the body was sometimes made from the burnt awheto or `vegetable caterpillar' (Cordiceps robertsii), but was not black enough for face-moko.
