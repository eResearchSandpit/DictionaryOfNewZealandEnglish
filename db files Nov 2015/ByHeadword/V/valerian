Quote: There's a red-pink wildflower currently dominating hillsides all over Wellington. Preferring sunny spots on clay banks or cracks in concrete, with reddish blooms made up of a cloud of tiny florets, it goes by many names including Centranthus ruber, Bouncing Bess, Drunken Sailor, Red spur, Spur valerian, Red valerian or False valerian.... In fact, Centranthus and true valerian are not closely related botanically; Centranthus probably gained the names because of a similarity between the flowers of the two plants.
