Quote: Through fissures so formed operated the mineralizing agencies which have effected rock-alteration, depositions of veinstone in open spaces, and veinstone replacements of wall-rock.<i>Ibid.</i> 10 Although the veinstone was free-milling,the gold occurred in such a fine state of division that the treatment faclities were altogether inadequate.   <i>Ibid.</i> 64  Here a small flinty leader ... intersected certain of the reefs, and ... greatly increased the value of the veinstone it intersected.
Notes: Bell and Fraser, Waihi-Tairua
