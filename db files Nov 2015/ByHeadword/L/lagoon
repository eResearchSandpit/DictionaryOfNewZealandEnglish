Definition:This common word has wide contextual usage in NZ - essentially a smallish, shallowish body of water - not necessarily or usually salt: indeed it can have salt (see x) or fresh (see y), muddy, or mineral, or clear; frozen or cold ( ) or boiling. It can be deep enough to drown in, or shallow enough to be merely an overloaded swamp ( ), or `sheet of water', or can even have no water ( ). It can be of some square miles (see Lake Grassmere) or small as a pond; early NZ uses follow this standard sense: get geog. as well as temporal coverage.

Quote: In the Neighbourhood of the head of the bay are two Lagoons one upwards of a mile across the other much smaller.  [ed fn] The large lagoon covering 213 acres of Miramar flat, originally called Roto Kura, then Para Lagoon, then Burnham Water, was drained in 1874. <i>Ibid.</i> 268  The first remarkable feature is a sand bank which divides a large brackish lagoon from the sea. ... Around the Lagoon is a belt of swamp constantly subject to inundation either from freshes or from eruptions from the sea.
