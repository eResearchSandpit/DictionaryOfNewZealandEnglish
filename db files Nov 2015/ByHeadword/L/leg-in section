Quote: The new [Heinemann's] dictionary carries: ... mall, ... M.O.W. and o.n.o. ... dropper (for fencing) ... and garage sale. It does not contain diff and carby (which have now moved from slang into general use among at least half the population), leg-in, woolly (as a noun), farmlet, fat (or sharp) sand, nor, amazingly, home-brew.

Quote: This new house, high on its hill [in Dunedin], stood behind the other houses that once had had bigger gardens but had sold their back sections. They called them leg-in sections because they had narrow steep drives running up between the houses to the garages built under the homes, with steps beside the drive for the walkers.
