Quote: The laughing jackass is unlike the well behaved boy inasmuch as the latter is seen and not heard - the former is heard but has never yet been seen. I should never have supposed it resemble a laughing jackass, never having heard a jackass laugh, unless I had been told that it did so - but the parties who stood sponsors for the bird doubtless knew what they were about and I might be highly culpable were I to style them fanciful or misinformed.

Quote:  [Attene albifacies, wekau of the Maoris, is known by some up-country settlers as the big owl or <i> laughing-jackass </i>.] Why it should share with one of our petrels and the great Dacelo of Australia the trivial name of `laughing jackass` we know not; if its cry resembles laughter at all it is the uncontrollable outburst, the convulsive shout of insanity.
