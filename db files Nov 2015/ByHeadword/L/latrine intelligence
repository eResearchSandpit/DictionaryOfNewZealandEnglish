Quote: Beautiful spies .... make such a fuss of Field Officers to gain the latest latrine intelligence cf P: Latrine Rumours (1915) - and remarks; Latrine Wireless (Aust. Soldiers' coll 1937); WF (WW2) (cf Sir Thomas Overbury Characters (B 14-16) quoted by J. Dover Wilson Life in Shakespeare's England 30 (Peng) `[The Franklin] is not so inquisitive after neus derived fromthe privy closet, when finding an aerie of hawks in his own ground, or the fealing of a colt come of a good strain are tidings more pleasant, more profitable.')
