Quote: The learners' chain is called the monkey chain, and the new chaps are called skulls, from the chaffing at the beginning: e.g., `Look at the skulls on them!', `They've got the right-shaped headfor it'. Learners retaliate by calling the old hands `lavatory chains' or more frequently `shithouse chains'.

Quote: I'd like to see them ... racing the chain, that remorseless heartless chain. And when the last is scrubbed and the chain is switched off, going down for a shower ... I'd like to see them on thechain. Even the learners' chain. In that narrow cell of concrete with the lambs swinging in quick time up the ramp from the sticking-pen.
