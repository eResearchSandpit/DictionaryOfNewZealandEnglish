Quote: New Zealand has developed many phrases that depend on local interpretation: e.g. `The Limited', `the six oclock rush', `off the bitumen', `motor camp', `to farewell', `to pencil in', `to check up on', `return (at meals)'. All these are immediately understandable to New Zealanders, but not always to others.

Quote: The introduction of the Limited train between Auckland and Wellington made an immediate appeal to the popular imagination... The introduction of a summer running train, which took advantage of the daylight, was also 'limited in its accommodation'... It brought about a desire for more specific titles, so "Daylight Limited" and "Night Limited" became the terms commonly used in referring to them.
