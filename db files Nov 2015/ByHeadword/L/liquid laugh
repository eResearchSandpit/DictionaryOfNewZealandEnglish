Quote: Just a small update on 'helicopter heave'; my brother recently spoke to a member of the Massey University Students' Assn, and he confirmed that the term is still in use (at Massey anyway). It is particularly associated with the "chunder-mile," a rather ,messy capping event... "Technicolour yawn" is used for an instance of vomiting, as is "liquid laugh', I believe.
