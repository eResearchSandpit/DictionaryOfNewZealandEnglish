Quote: The word has various shades of meaning between a playful youngster and a blackguardly rough. Little street-boys are often in a kindly way called little larrikins. (See quotations), 1870 and 1885.) Archibald Forbes described the larrikin as `a cross between the Street Arab and Hoodlum, with a dash of the Rough thrown in to improve the mixture.` (`Century.') The mostexalted position yet reached in liteature by this word is in Sir Richard Burton's Translation of the Arabian Nights' (1886-7), vol. i. p. 4,  Story of the larrikin and the Cook; vol. iv. p. 281, Tale of First Larrikin. The previous translator, Jonathan Scott, had rendered the Arabic word, Sharper. -->There are three views as to the origin of the word, viz.-->(I) That it is a phonetic spelling of the broad Irish pronunciation, with a trilled rof the word larking). The story goes that a certain Sergeant Dalton, about the year 1869, charged a youthful prisoner at the Melbourne Police Court with being ` a-larrr-akin' about the streets.` The police Magistrate, Mr Sturt, did not quite catch the word- `A what, Sergeant?` -`A larrikin', your Worchup.` The police court reporter used the word the next day in the paper, and it stuck. (see quotation, `Argus,' 1896.)  This story is believed by 99 persons out of 100: unfortunately it lacks confirmation; for the record of theincident cannot be discovered after long search in files by many people. Mr Skeat's warning must be remembered - -->`As a rule, derivations which require a story to be told turn out to be false.` -->(2) That the word is thieves' English, promoted like swag, plant, lift, etc., into ordinary Australian English. Warders testify that for a number of years before the word appeared in print, it was used among criminals in gaol as two separate words,  viz. leary('cute, fly, knowing), and kinchen(youngster),  `learykinchenshortened commonly into `leary-kin' and leary kid'. Australian wardens and constables are Irish, almost to a man. Their pronunciation of `leary kin' would be very nearly `lairy kin,' which becomes the single word  larrikin. (See quotation, 1871.) It is possible that Sergeant Dalton used this expression and was misunderstood by the reporter. (3) The word has been derived from the French larron  (a thief), which is from the Latin latronem (a robber).  This became in English larry, to which the English  diminutive, kinwas added; although this etymology is always derided in Melbourne.
