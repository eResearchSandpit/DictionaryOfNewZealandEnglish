Quote: Normally Ned and Mr. Ford loved each other like a dog loves mustard, but if either of them happened to get hold of a bottle, things were quite different. <i>Ibid.</i> 137  The story goes that at one part another coaching proprietor set up in opposition to Archie. The pair soon got to love each other like dogs love mustard.
