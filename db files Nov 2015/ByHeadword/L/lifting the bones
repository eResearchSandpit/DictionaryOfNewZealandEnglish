Quote: The body is enclosed in a mausoleum of carved woodwork within the `pah' for several months, and at the expiration of this period, the ceremony of `lifting the bones' takes place, which is performed by the nearest relative of the diseased. The bones, after being well scraped and cleaned, are then deposited in a box, and buried.
