Quote: A calcium deficiency does occur in lambing sickness which is a different disease and one which occurs more rarely than sleepy sickness. Lambing sickness, being a form of milk-fever, yields readily to calcium gluconate injections, but in the much more common sleepy sickness such injections are of no value.
