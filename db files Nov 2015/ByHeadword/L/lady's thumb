Quote: REDSHANK (<i>Polygonum persicaria</i>) is also called persicaria, spotted persicaria, knot weed, smart weed, willow weed, and lady's thumb. Perhaps also it is this weed that on the west coast of the South Island is called water pepper or Walker's weed. It is an annual weed of gardens, crops, and wet pastures.
