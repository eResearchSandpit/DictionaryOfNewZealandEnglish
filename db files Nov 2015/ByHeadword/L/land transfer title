Notes: Jim Cameron writes : Mainly historical (also <i>land transfer land</i>). Before the system became universal, sellers of land might stress that it was held under "land transfer title". Three such advertisements (1903, 1910 and 1926) are reproduced in W G Chapman and K M Wood <i>Karori Streets 1841 to 1991</i>.
