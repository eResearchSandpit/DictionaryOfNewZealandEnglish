Quote: It's called the "low-rider" - trousers or shorts worn on the hips and exposing a generous amount of boxer short. It's mostly adopted by boys, and it's a fashion some principals say is skirting with indecency...

Quote: A school principal reckons he has got the low-down on low-riders and has a plan he hopes will banish them from his school forever. The term "low-riders" describes the trend for young males, and occasionally females, to wear their shorts or trousers several sizes too large so that they hang below the wastline...
