Quote: These much sought-after but relatively rare flatfish [flounder and sole] are generally found on sandy bottoms of shallow inshore areas. There are eight commercial species in New Zealand : the sand flounder, yellowbelly flounder, greenback flounder, black flounder, lemon sole, common sole, brill and turbot.

Quote: SOLE, LEMON Unlike Common Sole the Lemon Sole has no rostral flap, which in the Common Sole conceals the mouth when viewed from the right side of the head. Colour varies, but usually has a distinct yellowish tinge on the upper surfaces which have a camouflaged appearance.

Quote: Of the remaining species with two pelvic fish, the Lemon Sole (<i>Pelotretis flavilatus </i>) has a normal snout like the Flounder, and a broadly mottled upper surface, with lemon underside. The others have a rounded anterior end caused by an overgrowth of the snout which in the sole (Plate II. fig. 4), often but quite wrongly called the `English' Sole, entirely conceals the mouth from above, while in the last two to be mentioned the mouth is still visible from above.

Quote: <i>The Lemon Sole </i> (Ammotretis rostratus). This fish is popularly known as the lemon sole, to distinguish it from <i> Peltorhamphus novae-zealandiae, Gunther, which the local fishermen call the English sole. The names are somewhat unfortunate, seeing that they are applied to totally different species in Britain. </i>
