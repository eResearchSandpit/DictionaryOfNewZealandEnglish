Quote: Various species of <i> Rubus </i>, a briar-like plant which is a nuisance to men in the bush. It also grows on moist or shady hillsides in the open and is a great danger to hoggets, as they get caught up in it. When growing in the open it is often called a <i> l.-bush </i>.  Except in Potts's `Out in the Open', to the best of my knowledge  a <i> b.l.</i> has always meant an argumentative fellow. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) [Lawyer = `briar` is recorded as English from the sixteenth century. The reason for the name is obvious.--A.W.]
