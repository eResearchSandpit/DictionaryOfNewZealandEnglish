Quote: [He].. was the national sailing coach who watched Coutts  graduate from a 10-year-old winning P-class regattas to a teenager wielding a laser tiller like a razor. <i>Ibid.</i> 83 He bought his P-class sails from Coutts' sail loft business; Coutts went on to coach him in P-classes and lasers during clinics at Murray's Bay and Tamaki.
