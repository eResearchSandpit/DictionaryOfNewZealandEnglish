Quote: Anderton joyfully lobbed back the fact that Asean countries were so suspicious of New Zealand's free trade lapdoggery that Mike Moore couldn't get them to vote for him to head the World Trade Organisation.... That our closest mates, Britain and Australia, wouldn't support Moore proved that there was material damage from the opposition to our doggery and stallery.
