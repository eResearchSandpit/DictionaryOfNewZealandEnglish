Quote: The majority of replies received have been in favour of the retention of what is now termed the Lemon Squeezer style, the hat which was formerly worn by the Territorials... This type of hat came into being at a Territorial camp held at Takapau in May 1914, when all units wore the slouch hat turned up at the left side... [Colonel Malone said] "You have a hat that.. resembles the peak in your district... You will now carry the badge of Mt. Egmont on your collar and hat and a replica of the peak on your head."
