Quote: ALBACORE ... Some confusion reigns as to this fellow's real name. As with many of our fish he has several. His scientific name can either be <i> Thunnus germo</i> or <i>Thunnus Alalunga</i>, depending on which authority you believe. Common names include Southern Bluefin, Longfin-Tuna and Longfin Albacore.
