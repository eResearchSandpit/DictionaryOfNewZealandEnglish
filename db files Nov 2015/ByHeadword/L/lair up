Quote: Derek Parsons, of Westport, wants to know the derivation of the verb lair up, which he hears used by people planning a party... Lair has a long history.... As the centuries passed it became a sideways look or leer, producing leery as a synonym for distrustful, still in proper use today. Moving right along, leery became lairy, meaning flashy, eventually producing lair for a person who dresses in a vulgar, exhibitionist style. Properly, to lair up is to dress in this style. If you want to have a sleazy party you should use lair it up.
