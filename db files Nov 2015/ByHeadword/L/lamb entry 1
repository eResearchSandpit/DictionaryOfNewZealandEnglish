Quote: The all-engrossing topics [in Canterbury] seemed to be sheep, horses, dogs, cattle, English grasses, paddocks, bush and so forth. I was rather startled to hear one gentleman ask another whether he meant to wash this year, and receive the answer `No.' I soon discovered that a person's sheep are himself. He does not wash his sheep before shearing, but he washes; and, most marvellous of all, it is not his sheep which lamb, but he `lambs down' himself.
Notes: (1860 Jan 28)
