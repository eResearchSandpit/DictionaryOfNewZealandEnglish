Quote: NEW ZEALAND MEGRIM or WITCH (MAHUE) <i> Caulopsetta scaphus </i> (Bloch and Schneider). In Napier it is known as Lantern-fish, but for what reason I am unable to say, unless it is from the peculiar transparency when it/is held up to a strong light. Another name given to this useless fish by local fishermen, in Port Chalmers at least, was that of Cadger's-fish.

Quote: MEGRIM ... Sometimes called Lantern-fish (because a lantern could be easily shone through it) and known to the Maoris as `mahue' - the fish that is left behind. Known to Christchurch fishermen in early years as the Bludger's Fish. It was the fish  they handed out to well-known bludgers who came down to the docks to cadge fish.
