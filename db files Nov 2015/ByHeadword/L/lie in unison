Quote: A mystery Immigration Srvice official.. is still under investigation by secretary of labour James Buwalda, who announced on Thursday he had sacked communications manager Ian Smith over the "lie in unison" memo. The investigation followed controversy about Mr Smith's handling of information relating to asylum seeker Ahmed Zaoui and a comment he made on an internal memo, suggesting staff had conspired to lie in response to inquiries about the case... However, no one else would be disciplined over the "lie in unison" memo and that matter was final.
