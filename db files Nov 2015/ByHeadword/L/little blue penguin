Quote: Canterbury has its own distinctive penguin, the white-flippered penguin, which is a local variant of the Little [sic] blue or fairy penguin found only in New Zealand and Australia. It is slightly heavier than the northern Little blue penguin, and has a distinctive white band along both edges of the flippers. They breed only on Banks Peninsula, Motunau Island and the neighbouring coasts.
