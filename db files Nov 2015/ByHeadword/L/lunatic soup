Quote: Lunatic soup. Strong drink: New Zealand: C. 20. B., 1941, `Lack of vigour or colour could not ... be a charge levelled against such terms for strong drink as lunatic soup, Africa speaks, plonk, steam, red Ned, or sheep wash,'. In Australia it specifically = `cheap red wine' (B., 1942). Elsewhere (Michael Harrison, Reported Safe Arrival, 1943) we find the variant lunatic'sbroth.
