Quote: Laughing Petrel (Laughing Jackass) --- Probably extinct. Last seen (dead) in 1916. <i>Ibid. 250  The kakas would screech and whistle, and on foggy evenings the laughing petrels, or laughing jackasses, as some people called them, would come rushing in from the sea, making for their nesting places in the hills, and start their hair-raising clatter close overhead. When I was a small boy, these shrieks gave me the creeps. I thought they sounded as if all the demons had got loose and were trying to frighten us, and I was always very thankful that there was someone nearby to protect me. I have not heard any of these birds for over thirty years, and presume that the stoats and weasels have accounted for them.
