Quote: We're wandering up the main street in a small country town 90 minutes' drive from Auckland Paeroa, home to a famous fizzy drink and, in case you hadn't made the connection, proud owner of the world's largest Lemon & Paeroa bottle - defiantly kitsch by the side of the road. Lemon & Paeroa is the last thing on anybody's mind this morning.
