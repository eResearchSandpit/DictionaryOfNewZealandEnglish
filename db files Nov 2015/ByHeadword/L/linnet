Quote: The birds are not remarkably musical - the linnets are rather so; The Bell-Bird, is of a purple colour, with a white spot on the breast, shaped like a bell. The Saddle back, is a brown bird with a bright red spot on its back like a saddle, these two last species, are about the size of a thrush. There are green parroquets, large hawks, and several kinds of wild ducks, besides Emus, greenbirds and woodhens, which are birds of excellent flavour.
