Quote: First heard it on the Maheno in 1915 from a `Tommy' who told me that before the war he was working at Day and Martin's, of blacking fame. `Ever heard of them?' he proudly asked me. `No, I can't say that I have,' I replied. He gave me such a look of pity and scorn that I could almost  feel myself shrivelling up. `Gor blime, chum, I worked for them fifteen years,' he said. `Yus, fifteen years making blacking, and my old woman is deeping my end up.  Never heard tell of them? `Leg swinger,' chum, that's what you are.'
