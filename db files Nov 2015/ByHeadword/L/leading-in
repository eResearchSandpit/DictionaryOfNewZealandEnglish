Quote: Stooking and Leading in. - The oat, wheat, and barley crops are ready ... Driving the binder requires experience. Men are wanted ... for stooking, i.e., picking up two sheaves and placingtheir heads together at an angle of about 45 degrees, 10 to 12 sheaves are generally put in one lot. ... There are ... good and bad stookers after years of experience...  Leading in. - When the grain has been long enough in stook, it is loaded on to drays ... and carted to the stack or mill ... The man driving the dray is called the leader-in, and the man who leads him, the forker.
