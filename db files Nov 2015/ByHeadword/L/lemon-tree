Quote: <i> [Pittosporum eugenioides </i>] it is often cultivated for its beauty, and is sometimes - though not so often  as P. [195] tenuifolium - used to form an ornamental hedge. It is known by a variety of names amongst the colonists, such as <i> Mapau, White Mapau </i>, and even <i> Maple </i>, and <i> Lemon-tree </i>. The Maori name seems to have been <i> Tarata </i>, but it is also called the <i> Mapau </i>.
