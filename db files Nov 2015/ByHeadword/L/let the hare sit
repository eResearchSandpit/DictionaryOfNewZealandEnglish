Quote: What of the saying "Let the hare sit", and why Timaru? I wondered idly for years. Then someone brought it up, saying hares as well as wallabies abounded around Timaru, and "Let the hare sit" was another way of saying don't do your bun - take it easy - there is plenty of time - <i>piano, piano, si, si</i>, do it tomorrow.
