Quote: When news reached the New Zealand Troops in Korea that the Army proposed to experiment with the Canadian-type ski cap as a replacement for the beret, or `flying saucer' ... The men of K Force want the peaked felt hat or `lemon squeezer' when they are on leave. ... The officers themselves do not wear berets when they go on leave. They wear the field service cap, or `cheese cutter'. ... Members of K Force who were in the 2nd N.Z.E.F. particularly want the `lemon squeezer' for leave. They know it is the distinctive New Zealand badge.

Quote: Malone's Wellington Battalion wore their brimmed felt hats with four distinctive dents, laterknown as the `Lemon Squeezer'. Malone instituted this headdress in his Territorial Battalion, the 11th Taranaki Rifles, and on his appointment to command the Wellington Battalion of the NZEF made this the headdress in the battalion. In 1916 this was adopted by the New Zealand Division. It is still worn in the NZ Army on ceremonial occasions.
