Quote: Proceeding just fair, but with their regularity that follows a shearer getting his back used to the arduous job, the advancement went on but with a different and a rougher cut than was usual. More frequently application of the loppies galloping down the board, to the ever increasing cry of `Tar'. The cut was becoming rougher and numbers spoilt good work, and slowly the gore of the classer, the shepherds, and certainly that of William Steuart, rose...  Conferences would be held, a slight glistening on the fibre of the fleece, when sunlight decreed `wet sheep' and then the shearers would declare a break, whilst the `loppies', paid wet or fine, would be put on varying jobs to fill in the time until the Lords and Masters of the situation agreed to work. <i>Ibid.</i> 50 The bell rang, the whole procedure stopped, shearers trooped out, half shorn sheep were pushed back into the catching pens. Jimmy Greave the classer hurriedly whispered to William Steuart todesist, but loppies, rousies, and even young Jim, who was assisting to pen up, followed out from the side door to where the shoots from the stands gave the nearest exit, to the level space of the outside turf, that made eventually the [boxing] ring.
