Quote: She made what we called `lillipy', a corruption of the Maori rerepe, a dish made by boiling the pollen of the raupo in water to a porridge. Mother's `lillipy' was made by stirring plain flour into boiling milk to a thick porridge, when it was poured out on to a huge meat plate and dotted and dabbed with butter and sugar, with a good sprinkling of nutmeg. It also was a fine lunch on a cold day.
