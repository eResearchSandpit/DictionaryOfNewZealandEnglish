Quote: It [Hooligan] at first typified a cross between a London rough and a Cockney tough, which are two terms for two but slightly different things, which have only the semblance of a shade of a shadow of difference, and are both akin to our Australasian larrikin. A larrikin is not necessarily a loafer or a criminal, though he is often, if not invariably, a member of a push which may, and usually does,  contain a certain criminal element, and a still larger element verging towards criminality.

Quote: The Auckland `larrikin`is a growing nuisance, but he is neither so numerous nor so objectionable as his folloe in Melbourne or Sydney. Unlike the street-arab, he is either a schoolboy, or earns his living somehow, or he is a truant from work of either kind. He hasexuberant spirits and an inordinate love of mischief ..... He has a sort of organisation of his own, and seems to revel in uncurbed liberty of action.

Quote: The chance mispronunciation of a colloquial word, by a Melbourne police officer, has added a new term to our language in the colonies. Who amongst us has not heard of the `larrikin'? He is essentially colonial, English cities may have `gamins` and the Pacific Slope can boast of `hoodlums` ... Though everybody speaks and writes about the `larrikin', what is he? ... I  presume, I may say, he is of the male sex and that his age ranges from 12 to 21. He is oftown origin. His amusements are various. He likes to be in the streets, and rather prefers to be about theatres. Smoking is his pastime. As to his actions the larrikins may be classed under two headings: 1) The mischievous larrikin 2) the criminal larrikin.

Quote: LaraZ.ri-kin (l&abreve.raZ.r&ibreve.aZ.k&ibreve.n), n. [Cf. prov. Eng. larrick lively, careless, larack to frolic, to romp. See Note below] 1. A street blackguard; a rowdy.  2. A hobbledehoy inclined to rough horseplay and practical joking. 3. In a general sense, an ill-bred or low-minded person; - often used merely as a contemptuous epithet.  4. A neglected boy who frequents the streets; a street Arab; a gutter snipe. Marcus Clarke.  In senses 1 and 2 this word has become common inEngland. Larrikin is thought to have come into use about 1870. Its origin, though much disputed, is commonly explained by the following anecdote : An Irish policeman at Melbourne, on bringing a notorious rough into court, was asked by the magistrate what the prisoner had been doing, and replied, "He was  a-larriki' [i. e., a-larking] about the streets." This story lacks confirmation, but the word may not improbably be connected with  lark to frolic, to which, indeed, the Prov. Eng. larrick and larrack are perhaps related.
