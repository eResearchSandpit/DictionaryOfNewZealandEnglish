Quote: As South Canterbury grew, this system proved increasingly inadequate and "landing services" were built to provide a safer and more efficient means of moving goods between ship and shore. A landing service consists, basically, of a large shed on shore from which a slipway leads down into the water. <i>Ibid.</i> 7 In 1870-71, the first part of the Landing Service Building was erected by Peter McRae, owner of the nearby Club Hotel, and leased by him to the Landing Service Co.
