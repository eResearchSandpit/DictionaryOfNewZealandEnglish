Quote: So passionate elsewhere was the popular feeling that with difficulty did Sir George Grey equip the new Legislative Council at [117] Wellington with its non-official members - `nominees' theywere called, a term which indeed became one of reproach. <i>Ibid.</i> 140 For the government of the Colony as a whole there were constituted the two Houses which at present exist - the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives, together constituting the General Assembly. The councillors were nominated by the Governor, in this respect resembling the old nominee system. They held their seats for life. As showing the fear and detestation in which the word `nominee' was held, Mr. Fox and others who assisted in passing the measure viewed the relating clauses as the great blots of the Act.

The six Provincial Councils, the House of Representatives, and the Superintendents of the Provinces were all elective, though the members of the Legislative Council (the Upper House) were nominated for life by the Governor.
