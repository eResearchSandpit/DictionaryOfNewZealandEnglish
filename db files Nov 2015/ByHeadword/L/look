Quote: [Grass-thieving] quickly came to an end, one old Scot [shepherd] looking his country with a catching dog and a sharp knife. <i>Ibid.</i> 132 The grass thieves [sc. farmers who ran their sheep on others' country as if by accident] thought we were hard on them, but after the Station disposed of the blocks adjoining them, they found our successors were far more severe, and this sort of thing quickly [133] came to an end, one old Scot looking his country with a catching dog and a sharp knife. Dead sheep, like dead men, tell no tales.
