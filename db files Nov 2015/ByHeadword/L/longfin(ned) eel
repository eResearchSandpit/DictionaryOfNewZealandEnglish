Quote: Both our varieties of eel - the short finned and the long finned - are good to eat. There's a slight variation in the colour of the flesh (pinkish in the case of the long-finned, greyish in the case of the short) but it takes an expert to tell the difference between the two.

Quote: New Zealand longfin eels, among the largest freshwater eels on Earth, breed just once and may live for more than 90 years.  They spend most of their lives in fresh water before making a 6000 km journey across the Pacific ocean, to a particular site thought to be near Tonga, where they breed and die.
