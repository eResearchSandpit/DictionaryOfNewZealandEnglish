Quote: Another company ... after driving southwards on No. 6 level, located a block ofgood-grade ore, which lived only a short distance above the level. <i>Ibid.</i> 58. From the Blackwater Mine a cross-cut was put out eastwards from No. 3 level for 800ft. but this was not far enough to reach the leader, if it lived to this depth.
