Quote: Alan Pye's hands physically shaped a small paradise in New Zealand called Huka Lodge, to which first anyone, and later chiefly a select few, were admitted, many of them again and again. <i>Ibid.</i> 11 By 1974 the Lodge had passed into the hands of Mrs and Mrs H.P. Harland-Baker, who subsequently carried out a series of improvements including the upgrading of the row of chalets facing the river bank... In the mid-1980s, Huka Lodge became the property of Mr. Alex van Heeren, who built a modern lodge and individual villas along the river-bank. <i>Ibid.</i> 45 Long before his dream began to come true, Alan had determined that his fishing-lodge would be only for men.

Quote: We tracked down 3 diverse properties, set on some of the country's finest sites, where the surrounding region is a natural source of leisure activities, fresh local food and wines, and guests can relax and recharge their spirits: Arthur's Pass Wilderness Lodge perched in the foothills of the Southern Alps, Paratiho Farms Lodge set in a stunning rolling green valley between Nelson and Motueka, and the Cavalli Beach House which nestles between two ridges with spectacular views over the jewel-like Cavalli Islands. Each offers very personal service overseen by owners who live on the properties and are constantly on hand to look after and pamper their guests.
