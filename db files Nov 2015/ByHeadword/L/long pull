Quote: Mr R. Guthrie did most of the judging - i.e., classes 2, 3, and 4. - and, on the whole, his verdicts were well received, but it must be said that his placing of the first dog in the Long Pull was a bit of a surprise to those who closely watched the running.

Quote: There are five standard classes [in dog trialling], each incorporating three events. The standard classes are as follows: Class I (the Long Pull); Class II (the Drive and Yard); Class IIA (a SouthIsland event); Class III (the Zig-zag or Slew) and Class IV (The Straight Hunt.) The three events in each class are: The maiden, for dogs which have not won a maiden event; the Intermediate, open only to dogs which have won a maiden but have not won an open; and lastly, the open itself. The standard events are usually held on hill courses.
