Quote: (Griffiths Collection) [in Aug 1975 it was used on TV1 without explanation] A television news item about the visit to Stewart Island by the Prime Minister (Mr Rowling) referred to the islanders' word for tourists, `loopys.' An islander has told the `Southland Times' that the word originated in another corner of Southland, Milford Sound, about 1970. `The name was coined by hotel staff who appeared to have a great contempt for `loopys',' said the islander. `It refers to the peculiar looping motion of the hand while swatting sandflies and to the `loopy' questions they ask.'

Quote: loopies: In the resort areas of New Zealand (particularly Central Otago), the residents and transient workers have a name for those of us who only come to sun, ski, climb or boat. I haven't been able to find the origin of this ungenerous appellation for tourists and I'm not sure I want to.

Quote: Loopies: the local [Golden Bay] word for tourists. I didn't understand it, but maybe, as ourtail-lights ascended, the locals were in the settlements below, pointing: There child, that red fire fly light on the mountain, there go the loopies.

Quote:  In the same Listener Aucklander Geoff Chapple, last heard of hiding behind a bush off the Heaphy Track, wondered why the South Island word for tourists is `loopies'. (At first he thought it was `loonies'.) We thought it must have come from `loopy', meaning wrong in the head, but sources in the southern heartland assure us that the term almost certainly derivesfrom tourists' propensity for taking the loop road in any given area, with the general idea of seeing more of the countryside. How diverting.

Quote: Loopies [headline] While leafing through the Listener of June 16 I came across the headline `Look, child, there go the loopies'. I quickly scanned the article to see if `loopy' meant what I thought it did. ... One of the words used by Mr Chapman was `loup', from the Norse `hlaupa' meaning `leap'. Orkney residents would describe tourists as `loupers', meaning `leapers', presumably because they jumped from place to place.
