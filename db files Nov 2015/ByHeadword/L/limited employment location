Quote: Other recent evidence that the Maori tribal collectivist model is a failure [to] include the high proportion of Maori living in towns/districts that the Goverment's jobs-jolt agenda has singled out as providing insufficient jobs for the unemployed to realistically expect to be able to find work. People can no longer move to these "limited employment locations" and expect to get the dole.
