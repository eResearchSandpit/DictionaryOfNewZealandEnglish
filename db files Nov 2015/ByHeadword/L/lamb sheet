Quote: In some districts things called `lamb sheets' are used. These are long strips of scrim or calico about three feet wide and twenty yards long with a cord through the top. When the sheep approach the yard and the danger of a / break begins, three or four of these sheets are run outbetween the men, making a sort of false yard of flapping white sheets which frightens the lambs back into the mob and enables the pressure to be put on to force them into the yard.
