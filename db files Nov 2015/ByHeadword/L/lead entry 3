Quote: They made a `lead' in the stockyard for branding the cattle. This was something like a `race' for branding sheep with a swing gate ..... It had a wide entrance gradually getting narrower and narrower till it became a lane only just wide enough for one beast at a time to squeeze through ... Five or six would he jammed in at one time ... the gate at each end being closed .... in a few minutes each lot could be branded.
