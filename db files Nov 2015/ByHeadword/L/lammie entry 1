Quote:  The fame of the West Coaster's `own' garment for outdoor workers - the ubiquitous miner's `lammie' - has spread far afield. This week a trial parcel of lammies was dispatched on request to members of the Malayan Police Force at Singapore who indicated in a letter to the Kumara firm which has made a specialty of supplying lammies since the gold rush days that they had heard of the unique qualities of the garment. The full story of the request from Singapore is not known, but it is believed that Auckland Chinese market gardeners may have been responsible. For many years Chinese gardeners have adopted the lammie as almost an `official uniform' and supplies for Auckland are regularly forwarded from the small business in Kumara. But what is a lammie? In the first place it is a strictly utilitarian garment with no claims to attractiveness in appearance. The original type - still in use after 70 years - was a loose-fitting almost shapeless shirt buttoned in front and with elbow-length sleeves made of flannel and water-proofed. It is this proofing quality which has established the popularity of the lammie. It was an ideal garment for outdoor workers in the West Coast climate, enabling them to keep drywithout the encumbrance of an overcoat and it was soon in general use on the gold fields, later to be adopted by bushworkers, navvies and many farmers. At first the lammie was made of moleskin, then grey flannel and over the past 20 years of navy flannel, but the proofing formula has remained unchanged. In recent years there has also been developed a modified style, double breasted Coast fashion, but the original shirt style is still popular. Apart from the fact that the historic gold-mining town of Kumara is regarded as the home of the lammie in New Zealand, the story of its origin has been lost. It is thought, however, that it was probably brought to the goldfields by the first Welsh diggers and that it may have been spelt `Llamy.' It was soon almosta universal garment among diggers, including big contingents of Chinese miners who found it ideal both for utility and for economy.

Quote: [corresp. col.] Sir, - In reference to your article on the West Coast shirt called a `lammie,' when a girl over 58 years ago I used to visit a couple named Tait who lived in Dillsmanstown. Mr. had a sluicing claim, and a draper named Todd used to get special flannel by the bolt for Mrs. Tait, and she made these `lammies.' She waterproofed them by dipping them in a special solution two or three times and hanging them on a line dripping wet, to dry each time. They were sold for 2 [pounds] 10/- to 2 [pounds] 15/- but I'm sure she never sold one to a Chinaman. There were  hundreds there working tailings. It was Mrs. Tait's own invention I am sure. - I am, etc.,
