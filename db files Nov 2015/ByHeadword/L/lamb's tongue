Quote: BROAD-LEAVED PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago major </i>), also called ratstail, birdseed, lamb's tongue, and greater plantain, is common on roadsides and trodden places throughout the country and in pastures in the King Country. ... From the middle of the rosette ascends the flower stalk ... , which afterwards give[s] place to seeds, and produce[s] the ratstail appearance that gives the plant one of its trivial names. The long spikes of seed pods are often used for feeding caged birds. ... PLANTAIN (Plantago lanceolata) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.
