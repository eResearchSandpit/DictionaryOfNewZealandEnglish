Quote: I was intrigued to see in your column something called a lemonade apple. .. Prove to me that the lemonade apple does indeed exist by telling me where I can find it.  .. Ed - These apples are no hoax, they're a new Royal Gala/Braeburn cross by <i>Yummy (yummyfruit.co.nz</i>.   This was their first commercial crop and only a few pallets were produced from young trees, but the might be back next season.
