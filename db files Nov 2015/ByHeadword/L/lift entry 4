Quote:  Such was that dog's way with sheep that when running out - say on the right - he could make his lift from round about three o'clock and yet turn his sheep directly towards me. I have, of course, often heard the argument that the run-out cannot be judged until the dog has lifted his sheep. In other words, provided the sheep turn directly towards the man when `lifted', the dog has finished his head correctly regardless of whether it is short or otherwise. <i>Ibid.</i> 168 (Glossary) Lift: When a dog has completed his head his next job is quietly to start them on the `pull'. This, the first movement in the pull, is known as the lift. To pull is to bring the sheep back to the man.
