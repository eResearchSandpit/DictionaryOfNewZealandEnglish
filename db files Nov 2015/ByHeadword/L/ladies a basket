Quote: `A dance will be held in Paewhenua Hall on ... Good music. Good floor. Gents, 2/6; Ladies, 1/6 or Basket. Otorohanga Patrons - Metalled road to the door.'  That was the notice the other day in a King Country paper. `Ladies, a basket' is a customary dance-night formula in the outback, and a convenient arrangement it is. Those liberal baskets of home-made dainties outdo anything you can buy for the money in your town shops.
