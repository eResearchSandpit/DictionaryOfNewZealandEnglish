Notes: Jim Cameron writes: This long-standing US synonym for a law firm or a solicitors' office is recorded as <i>NAmer</i> in NSOD. It is now quite common in NZ and seems to have become naturalised here. There is for instance at least one firm in Masterton and another in Featherston whose signs say "law offices". (Its use seems to have closely followed the modification of advertising restrictions on solicitors a few years back).
