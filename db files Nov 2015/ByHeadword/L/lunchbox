Quote: Mr Smith.. has not returned calls asking for an interview the following day about Dunedin's renowned "tartan mafia", of which he is a leading light... Though it may sound like it, the "tartan mafia" is not a derogatory term for the city's close-knit business community, which on occasions also uses the term... Mr Marsh is one of Dunedin's richest men, an acountant who invested wisely in car-dealing, property and manufacturing companies. He says there is no "formal tartan mafia".

Quote: The signs have been there for years. They've been in underwear ads where pouting boys, lunchboxes packed, gaze out of the pages of women's glossies... My current copy of <i>Vogue</i> has similar ads for perfume, all nudity and smoulder, though none is as lovingly explicit as a recent ad which featured a male model with his whole lunchbox unpacked.
