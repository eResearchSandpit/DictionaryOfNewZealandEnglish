Quote: The new system was installed at the Waiareka saleyards in Oamaru on Monday, the first saleyards in Otago to have the Livestock Auction Management System (Lams) operating. Lams is effectively the transaction processing part of the system which will enable tax invoices, sale notes, delivery dockets and vendor declaration details to be produced on sale day at the sale.
