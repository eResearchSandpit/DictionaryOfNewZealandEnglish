Quote: The first axial-water-feed hammer-drills were available about 1910. Leyner drills of this type were by then widely used in tunnels in the United States. They represented a great advance over  the piston-type drills and besides proving more efficient reduced the dust problem underground. The Leyners were followed by other makes, notably Holman's, but the name persisted and the common name for the `big machine' or drifter at Waihi remained the `liner'. These drills were worked in a steel cradle about four-and-a-half-feet long, mounted on a feed-screw with a short handle at the rear ... <i>Ibid.</i> 326  Leyner water-feed-drill: The first axial-water-feed-drill used at Waihi.
