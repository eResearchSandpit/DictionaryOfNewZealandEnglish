Quote: Lodgepole pine, <i>Pinus contorta</i>, is a relative of the familiar radiata pine... In the south-eastern Kaweka Ranges contorta has marched across the southern ridges, shading out many species, and in places is so thick that pushing through it has become virtually impossible. Each year, the Department of Conservation tackles areas of contorta for removal, but it is an ongoing and expensive battle. In the eastern South Island ,there is no control, and contorta threatens to change tussockland into exotic forests.
