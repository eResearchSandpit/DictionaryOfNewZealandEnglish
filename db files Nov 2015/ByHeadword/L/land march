Notes: Check page* I think this refers to the 1863 march, an account of which appeared in the 1863 NZ Advertiser 27 Aug. 2A body of armed natives, mustering 42,passed through Greytown yesterday(Monday). They passed in marching order,appearing to mimic the soldiers. Theywere a very ragged mob, and caused greatlaughter. They were supposed to be goingto a feast at Waianga.A further notice appeared in the 1863 NZ Advertiser 29 Aug. 2It may be true that not more than forty-two armed natives passed through Greytownlast Monday, of whom not more than three-fourths were armed with guns, but was notsuch an exhibition calculated to alarm heisolated settlers, and to prevent themfrom carrying on their usual avocationsin a quiet manner.
