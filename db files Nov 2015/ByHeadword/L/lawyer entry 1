Quote: So to cope with the rituals of tramping, its pains and camaraderie, a slang language has developed to suit. Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

Quote: ... it may be explained that a `lawyer' is a bramble which grows in very dense masses, and is covered with small thorns. It is so named because, when once a man is unfortunate enough to getinto its clutches, he finds it hard to free himself.

Quote: <i> Lawyer </i> ... One of the English provincial uses of this word is for a thorny stem of a briar of bramble. In New Zealand, the name is used  in this sense for the <i> Rubus australis </i>, N.O. <i> Rosaceae </i>, or  Wild Raspberry-Vine (Maori, <i> Tataramoa </i>). The words <i> Bush-Lawyer,  Lawyer-Vine </i>, and <i> Lawyer-Palm </i>, are used with the same signification, and are also applied in some colonies to the  <i> Calamus australis </i>, Mart. (called also Lawyer-Cane), and to  <i> Flagellaria indica </i>, Linn., similar trailing plants. [Aus 1885]

Quote: It comprised a series of good terraces around about 1,500 to 1,800 feet and a big stretch of steep nor'-west facings which was about the first country on the place to clear after snow. However it had one big drawback for hoggets - it was bad with `lawyers'.  A `lawyer', perhaps I should explain, is a dense bushy plant characterised by thousands and thousands of hooklike barbs along every inch of its creeper-like branches and tentacles.  ...How the plant came to get the name of Lawyer I don't know, but it is commonly said that, like those gentlemen of the legal profession, once they get their hooks into you, you've had it.
