Quote: (Westland) Bill Oats with his lokey, which provides cheap and reliable transport over boggy ground. -->The first task was construction of a small `lokey'. After Oats had sketched out the general arangement , construction was undertaken by a Whataroa firm. Oats already had a setof wheels suitable for wooden rails, and the engine from an old Ford 100E was at hand. It took 2 [and a half] days to build, and with half a 44-gallon drum as a bonnet and a coast of green paint, was soon looking a picture.

Quote: Whilst working for Smyth Bros & Boryer, Arohena, 1942 to 1945, then Ngaroma 1945 to 1956, the Lockie was turned around with the smoke box facing the load... My guess is that the photo was taken at Taurewa prior to 1942 when Egmont Box owned the Lockie.
