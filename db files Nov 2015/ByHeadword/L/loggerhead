Quote: At the stern, a planking even with the gunwales reaches five or six feet forward, and is perforated perpendicularly by the <i>logger-head</i>, a cylindrical piece of wood about six inches in diameter, which is used for checking the whale-line by taking a turn or two around it. <i>Ibid./</i> 329 The headman chuckles as he cuts a notch on the loggerhead.
