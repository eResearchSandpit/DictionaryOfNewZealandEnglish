Quote: A specific charge was laid against Burke of what is classically known as `lambing down,' a common enough business in the olden days but little heard of now, except in the backblocks of Australia after shearing.

Quote: In these modern times, `lambing down', a term that passed for good Australian slang, has become a little out of date.

Over the counter went his hard-earned chequeand, when that cheque was `cut out' ..., the celebrant was kicked out.
