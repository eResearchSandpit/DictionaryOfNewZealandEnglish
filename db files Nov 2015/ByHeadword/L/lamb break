Quote: When a lamb peels off from a mob, it's called a lamb break. This is most likely to occur when they've become mismothered - that is separated from their mothers in the mob which, as you can imagine, makes them pretty upset. Lamb breaks are dreaded by shepherds because they can start a chain reaction, with the entire mob rapidly getting out of control.
