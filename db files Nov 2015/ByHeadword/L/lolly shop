Notes: (further from Dalley's article 10) The lolly shops and tobacconists behind which some one-woman brothels operated were more than a convenient facade or 'legitimate' reason for men to gather. Many of the one-woman brothel keepers ran their front shops, as well as their prostitution trade, as regular business enterprises, selling merchandise as any other retailer would. The association between the legitimate frontage and the activity in the back rooms also reflected what Ann-Louise Shapiro has termed the 'polymorphous world of commerce and sexuality' which infused urban life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Quote: [Hdg] Sex, Lies & Lolly Shops... On February 10, 1916, Truth published an article entitled 'A Grave Problem, Vile Disease and Dreadful Truth' about the so called 'lolly shops' in Cambridge Tce that were actually facades for brothels... Dalley has investigated the existence of these lolly shops, which were legitimate after a law was passed in 1908 that allowed prostitutes to operate from brothels providing they didn't employ anyone else... During World War I troops from Trentham came into town and lined up outside the shop... Particularly because it was opposite the Queen Victoria statue - it became known as Gallipoli.

Quote: [Title] Lolly shops 'of the red-light kind' and 'soldiers of the King'. Suppressing one-woman brothels in New Zealand, 1908-1916. <i>Ibid.</i> 15 <i>Truth</i>, in its usual melodramatic style of making sex news, reported evocatively of one-woman brothels: 'the confectionery bagnio . . . "lollie shops" in Cambridge-terrace [which] are houses of crimson vice'.  In its 'Warning to Warriors when in Wellington,' it describes in meticulous detail a lolly shop, 'one of the "red light" kind', which, the tabloid claimed, would receive as many as 40 clients of an evening, all 'soldiers of the King.'
