Quote: Little Pigs in Blankets. Season some large oysters with salt and pepper, have  ready some slices of bacon cut rather thin, put one or two oysters on each slice and roll it up, fasten each one with a small skewer, fry them for about two minutes - just the time to let the bacon become crisp; serve at once on fried toast.
