Quote: 'Get the dry dries, the wet dries and the late wets' .. When Nimmo came by me, I asked him to translate. The first were fat barren ewes destined for harder territory, the second were those who lost their lambs destined for harder territory, and then he too was gone, but I figured 'late wets' were late lambers who'd want a wee spell before their lambs were docked.
