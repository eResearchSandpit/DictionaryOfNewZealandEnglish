Definition:In esp. NI towns, the standard `loaf' size was usually the two-pound, with a half-loaf being a pound. In country districts, esp. in the South Island, the standard loaf size was usually four-pound; with a half-loaf, two-pound, and a quarter-loaf, one pound. `Tourists' and holiday makers from towns were and are often thus confused when ordering country bread: the town's `half' was the country's `quarter' loaf.

Quote: <i>bread</i>: It comes in standard-sized loaves (government regulation). 350g (about 12 oz), 500g (about 1 lb), 700g (about 1 and a half lb). Unfortunately, common parlance for these loaves differs between the North and South islands. Many of the 700g loaves are made like a camel with two so that they can conveniently be split in half. Usually, if you ask for a loaf in the South Island it is one of these two humps (350g) that you get. In the North Island, if you want the same amount of bread (350g) you must ask for a half loaf. The other thing about bread, is that in this land of abundant food, where restaurant servings are usually generous, it is very hard to get more than one piece of bread (or one roll). Unlike North America, where they seem to hope you will settle for smaller servings if you fill up with bread, in New Zealand restaurants appear afraid that you will spoil your appetite with the stuff.
