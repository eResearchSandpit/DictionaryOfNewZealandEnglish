Quote: The extreme toughness of the leaf and the presence of this cottony material [on the under surface] have given rise to the popular [53] colonial name applied to the more familiar species [of <i> Celmisia </i>], - the `Leather' or `Cotton' plant. They are also known partly as the `Native Aster,' - a term applied, however, equally  to species of <i> Olearia </i> and <i> Mesembryanthemum </i>.
