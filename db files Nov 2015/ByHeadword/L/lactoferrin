Quote: Nutriceuticals are purified proteins which have some sort of useful biological activity in addition to their food value. Best known is lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein with antibacterial properties which has been approved for use on meat as a means of reducing bacterial spoilage... But the real beauty of lactoferrin.. is that removing it from milk has no effect on milk quality or properties.
