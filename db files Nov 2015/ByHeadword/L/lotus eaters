Quote: Glossary. B-Ech:  contraction for B-echelon reserve section of a unit - Lotus Eaters. -->From Tennyson's poem `The Lotos Eaters' (with popular confusion with lotus): They sat them down upon the yellow sand,/... And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,/ Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore/ Most weary seem'd the sea... In the afternoon they came into a land/ In which it seemed always afternoon.
