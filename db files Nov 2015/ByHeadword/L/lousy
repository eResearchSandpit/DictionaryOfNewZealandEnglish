Quote: There is nothing lousy about him, and I always believe in giving a man a fair go and that's why I object to the word crayfish and I think you fellows are making it too hot when you say that. His offsider said `Give a man a fair go', so I gave him a bit of kidney pie and there was nothing lousy about him, but he said he had to be careful because the other fellow was the trump of the dump.
Notes: A.E. Strong WW1 scene
