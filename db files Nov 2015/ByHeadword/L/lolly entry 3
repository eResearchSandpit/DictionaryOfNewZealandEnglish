Quote: Once when she couldn't have me Dad let me go to the flicks by myself. He gave me some extra money, so I went to the milkbar and bought a gobstopper and some other lollies. I stuffed my face, and felt crook all the way home. He bought new footy boots for my eldest brother too, and an Art Union ticket for Mum. He must have had a beaut time up the RSA that day, I reckon.
