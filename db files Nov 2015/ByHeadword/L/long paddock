Quote: The spotlight has been trained once again on to the `long paddock', that vexed question thatliberal-minded, trail-blazing surveyors passed on to posterity.  Their bequest made provision for a five-figure mileage of main roads and a chain-wide vastness in secondary roads longer than the distance from New Zealand to Europe and back again. The purpose of this article is not to take liberties with statistics, for nobody has measured accurately the potential that the Hawke's Bay County Council spoke of in its recent decision to press for action on the shameful wastageperpetuated by the sanctity of the long paddock.
