Quote: A dodge by owners that should have been worked out ages ago is the legging up of unfashionable horsemen when they want a horse stopped, and then, later on, when they want to back him, they put up a `big gun.' It is manifestly unfair to the boys, but the latter are compelled to `hook 'em' as they get so little riding that four quid is often very handy to them.
