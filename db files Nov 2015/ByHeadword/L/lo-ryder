Quote: In response to Felicity Monk's story ("Does my bum look naked in this?"),.. on "lo ryders", as she calls them, I was disgusted at the way she portrayed people who have enough confidence to wear clothes in a way that <i>they</i> want and not to worry about what others think.

Quote: Girls are wearing their pants low. Very low. They're called - well, of course they are - lo ryders and, if they rode any lower, barbershops could be in for a roaring trade. <i>Ibid.</i> 31 Lo ryders are about as practical as a pair of MC Hammer pants on a sprinter. If you have ever watched a lo ryder wearer attempt to manoeuvre herself into a seated position, you will know.
