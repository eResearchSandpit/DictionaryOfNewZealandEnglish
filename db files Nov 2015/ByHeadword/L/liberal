Quote: The New Zealand Liberal Party was a world apart from its British namesake. ... The political ideals of the New Zealand Liberals were similar to those of the Fabians and other socialist groups in England; the Nationalist Clubs, the Knights of Labour, and the Populists in the United States; the Labour Parties in Australia.
