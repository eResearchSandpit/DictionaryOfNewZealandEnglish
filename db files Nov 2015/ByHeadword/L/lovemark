Quote: In his new book <i>Lovemarks</i>, a blend of autobiography and self-help business guide, [Kevin Roberts] discusses a world where consumers are no longer motivated by brand loyalty, but by "lovemarks" - emotional attachments to products... "So I thought, 'What comes next?' I figured out what came next : lovemarks."
