Quote: It was at this time [c1851], that the smart and appropriate sobriquet of the `Little Enemy' was  affixed to a small but obstructive body of gentlemen in the community, mostly of standing and intelligence, and supporters of Sir George Grey. English and Episcopalian, they were viewed as intruders ... and reciprocated by seeing in the special scheme of the settlement and its leaders all that was narrow and intolerant. In a superior way they stood aloof from the rest, and their attitude was one of opposition. ... No quarter was given, no consideration shown on either side. The advent of the beneficent constitution finally ended these bickerings ... and though the term `Little Enemy' clung long, it was rather as a memory than a badge.
