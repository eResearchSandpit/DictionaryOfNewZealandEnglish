Quote: One of the earliest land-seekers in the Waimate County was Miss Jeanie Collier whose applications for land were gazetted on Feb 1. 1855. Miss Collier was the only woman land-seeker in South Canterbury. She was about 62 years old when she reached Canterbury with her three young nephews, Leslie, James and Andrew Thomson, and she set about establishing them on the land.
