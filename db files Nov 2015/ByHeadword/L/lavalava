Quote: [Hdg] Lavalava as part of uniform gives pupils big lift in their morale. At Auckland's Avondale intermediate, male teachers rustle around in skirts, boys play rugby in skirts and the principal enjoys wearing a purple one printed with hibiscus flowers... It is part of a new uniform policy - the first school in New Zealand to introduce lavalavas... "The fact is that they're a Pacific Island thing is superseded by the fact that children feel that they belong to their whanau wearing the lavalavas."
