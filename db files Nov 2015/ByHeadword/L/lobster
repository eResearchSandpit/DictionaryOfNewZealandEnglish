Quote: In order to ascertain the possibilities of lobsters [European lobster,  <i> Homarus vulgaris </i>] and crayfish living peaceably together, one of each, both accustomed to confinement, were placed in an observation-tank. But there can be no question as to the lobster being `boss,' as it chased the crayfish about the tank, snapping at it with its powerful claws, the crayfish having to ascend to the surface to get out of its way, so that they had to be at once separated.
