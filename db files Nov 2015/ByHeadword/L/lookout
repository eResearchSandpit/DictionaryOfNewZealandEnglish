Notes: Jim writes : In the sense of an elevated place from which the landscape may be viewed, this is in NZPOD but not DNZE. It appears not to be a British use (except perhaps in the form <i>lookout point</i>); the equivalent is <i>viewpoint</i> which is the term in British road atlases etc. Lookout in this sense is also AusE - see Macquarie 1981 and MAU 236.
