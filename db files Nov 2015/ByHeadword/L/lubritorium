Quote: I started working as the manager of the Farmers lubritorium in 1941, shortly before I went to serve in the Pacific war. I  returned to the lubritorium after I was wounded, in 1944... In those days, the days of the big department stores, Farmers customers would come into the store and leave their cars at the lubritorium to be greased.
