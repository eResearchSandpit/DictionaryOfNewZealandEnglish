Quote: In the shearing shed there is a strict social order, ... Below [the gun shearers, the professionals] are the `learners' - men and boys in their first and second seasons. Then the shed-hands, in order of experience and ability, the `fleecies' who pick up the wool from the shearing board, and the `balers' who man the presses.
