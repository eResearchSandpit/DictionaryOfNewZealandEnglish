Notes: Jim Cameron writes : This soon became the predominant form of land title, and since about 1950 almost the sole form, replacing the former <i>deeds system</i> introduced in 1842. The land transfer system was based on the <i>Torrens system</i> first introduced in South Australia in 1858. That term (which NSOD records) is occasionally used in NZ as a synonym. In England <i>registered land</i> has broadly the same status.

Quote: The land transfer system and land transfer title are at the heart of New Zealand conveyancing law.  Their social as well as legal importance is considerable, but the terms do not appear in any general dictionary.  They are seldom encountered today, simply because the land transfer system has become to all intents and purposes the sole conveyancing system in New Zealand. In Australia the same system is known as the Torrens system after its South Australian originator.
