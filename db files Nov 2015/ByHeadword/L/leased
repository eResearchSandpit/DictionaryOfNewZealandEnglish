Quote: For one agency to have nearly half the leased executives is something which shows, I would have thought, not good planning... The Corrections Department was the only other government department in double figures, hiring 13 leased executives at a total cost of $1.05 million... Agencies should avoid leased staff being used in roles where they will be the public face of the agency - either internally or externally - over an extended period... The department had 41 leased contracts, 38 of which were in the IT areas... Generally, to source and retain these people the department has had to enter into leased contracts.
