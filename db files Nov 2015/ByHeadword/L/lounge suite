Notes: Jim Cameron writes : OED defines the word as "a set of furniture of the same pattern, frequently with reference to 2 armchairs and a sofa". NSOD & Collins define the word in this sense as "esp. of 2 armchairs and a settee." NZPOD following English POD gives "a sofa and armchairs of the same design." This is usually called a <i>lounge suite</i> in NZ, a term not recorded in the British dictionaries. The NZ use of suite ordinarily encompasses also a <i>dining suite</i> and a <i>bedroom suite</i>. (I have seen bedroom suite used in an English mystery novel published a few years ago). See furniture store ads in any newspaper or circular. In NZ, the meaning of <i>suite</i> by itself would be uncertain except in context.
