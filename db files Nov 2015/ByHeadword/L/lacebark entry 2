Quote: On account of the fibrous nature of [<i> Plagianthus Lyallii'</i> s] inner bark, it is popularly known in the Middle Island as one of the `Ribbon Wood' or `Lace Bark' trees, as is the  Hoheria populnea, and its varieties in the Northern Island. <i>Ibid.</i> 55 Hoheria... It is asserted that at one time "Lace-bark" bonnets were quite fashionable in Nelson... HOHERIA POPULNEA (<i> A.Cunn.</i>) ... The `HOUI' or `WHAU-WHI'.- ... grows abundantly in both Islands... Owing to the chaste [snow-white] appearance of its flowers, it has not inaptly been termed by some the `New Zealand orange Blossom'. The inner bark is peculiar, and consists of layer upon layer of laced fibre, ...From this peculiarity it is called by the settlers the `Thousand Jacket', `lace-bark', or `Ribbon-wood'.
