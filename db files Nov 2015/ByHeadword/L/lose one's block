Quote: Mr. M.J. Reardon, of the Trades Hall, Wellington, seems to have lost his block. The conditions of the Waihi settlement do not please him; but as they please nobody else in working-class ranks the general displeasure hardly seems sufficient grounds for Mr. M.J. Reardon taking leave of his senses.
