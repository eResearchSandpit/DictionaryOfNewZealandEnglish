Quote: A New Zealand native that isn't widely recognised, but which I think should be, is the ribbon wood <i>Plagianthus regius</i> which can be found over much of the country, including Stewart Island and the Chathams... The common name, ribbonwood, was given by the early settlers because of the tree's inner, ribbon-like bark. These layers are very tough and were once used by Maoris for making rope and twine for fishing nets.

Quote: <i>Plagianthus [betulinus]</i>, however, has much  larger leaves than <i>Betulus</i> [the English birch]. Owing to the presence of an inner, ribbon-like bark, it is generally called the Ribbonwood by the colonists.
