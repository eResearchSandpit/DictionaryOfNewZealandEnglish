Quote: The court heard that they assaulted the boy using a process they referred to as giving him a "lag". . . . It was said they would pick the toddler up, throw him over their shoulders, and "body slam" him on to a mattress. . . . Lags were also said to include regular punching and kicking of the boy. . . . just about every day the men would take the child into his bedroom and give him a lag. . . . The lags became punishment for when the boy was "naughty" and resulted in him crying.
