Quote: It debased the budget in the place where it ought to matter most and underlined the growing importance of the late 80s phenomenon called the lock-up. Lock-ups are sealed-room briefings for journalists and analysts two nor three hours before the budget presentation... The opposition is locked out of the lock-up, and the government's own backbenchers get only a cursory briefing just before the budget's delivered.

Quote: If only the Greens had staged their silent protest a day later. The press gallery and a phalanx of analysts and technicians could have been saved the boredom of the budget lock-up to concentrate on the only issue on political minds - the election date and anything that may precipitate it. But no, Thursday's lock-up went, as it always does, without a hitch.

Quote: [The government] assembled a Budget-sized mob of officials and held a lock-up. This is a thing whereby journalists and hangers-on are detained for a couple of hours under guard, minus cellphones - burly security escorts to and from the toilet, the works - while they are briefed about the documents. The ideas being, if let loose too soon, they might derange the Dow Jones with half-cocked ideas of the government's brilliant blueprint for worl domination.

Quote: <b>It's tradition</b> that the guys and gals from the money markets and the scribes from the parliamentary press gallery get an advance peek at the budget in special "lock-ups" held before the finance minister reads the document in the House.
