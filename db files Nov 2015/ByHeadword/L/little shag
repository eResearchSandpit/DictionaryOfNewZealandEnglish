Quote: LITTLE SHAG <i>Phalacrocorax melanoleucos brevirostris Maori name</i>: Kawaupaka. The name White-throated Shag is also in general use for the most abundant phase of a rather variable species which, at its other extreme, is identical with the Little Pied Shag of Australia. However, as intermediates occur, and the Little Pied form is relatively uncommon, it seems more convenient to treat the New Zealand population as a variable one under a distinctive name.
