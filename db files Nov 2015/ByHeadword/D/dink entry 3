Quote: The common method of addressing a New Zealander is to call him "digger," which, from being an abusive term, has been readily and universally adopted and approved by the Pig Islanders themselves. We, the N.Z.R.B., prefer to be addressed as "diggers" rather than "dinks" which was the original mode of address.
