Quote: The `drummer,' starting from the man who carried a drum, became the man who carried a swag and (then or thereafter) the loaded man (as a commercial traveller loaded with samples). To `carry the load' is another synonym; and the essential point throughout the symbolry was evidently the load.  ... and a `drummer' is the man with the lowest tally - perhaps because he is likeliest to take and keep the track with his `load.' The general applications of these fresh significations may be doubted.

Quote: drummer: The name given to the shearer with the lowest daily tally. He is not necessarily a bad or lazy shearer, but simply slower than the rest, and in a group of good shearers he could be quite competent, but not as good as the others.
