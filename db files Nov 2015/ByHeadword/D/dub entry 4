Quote: Cock fighting was a favoured sport on the goldfields and some very gallant birds were bred for this old English pastime. At Marsden, a secluded mining township in the bush some distance from Kumara, many cock fights were fought and a lot of money changed hands over the fate of these fights called `mains.' One of the cockers gave my father a beautiful white cock, his comb dubbed, trimmed and fighting fit.
