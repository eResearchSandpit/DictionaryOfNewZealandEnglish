Quote: A `ropey' will learn to snipe - which is a highly-skilled operation. The butt end of a clean-trimmed log is trimmed of angles. V's are cut at points opposite each other at the butt end (usually) and are connected by a Dee which runs round in a D from one to the other. In the Dee is laid a `strop', a short length of cable with an eye in each end. The eyes are connected with each other and to a short chain by a shackle; and the chain is attached to `the rope' with a hitch.
