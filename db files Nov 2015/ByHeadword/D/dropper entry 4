Quote: She does catering, he said. And she sells it. You know what I mean, Dave - sly grog.  One time when the police raided her she was doing the washing, Johnny said. And they reckoned they'd got her this time, because they'd found out a dropper had been through the town just a few nights before on his lorry. So they reckoned she'd be well stocked up. <i>Ibid.</i> 255 [The police] reckon they'd got her [slygrogging] this time, because they'd found out a dropper had been through the town just a few nights before on his lorry.
