Quote: Docking in those days was vastly different to which it is today. It was a bloody job for both catchers and lambs. The docker usually ended the day with a face looking like a squashed tomato. When a lamb was caught it was carried to a bench and held in front of the docker before proceedings commenced. The docker noted the sex, then earmarked accordingly.
