Quote: Draft: (i) To divide stock into classes, either in a yard or  (cattle) by cutting out (q.v.). In the old days sheep were hand drafted, i.e. lifted over a rail or manhandled through agate. (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p.135) About 1864 it was found possible to run sheep one at a time through a drafting race and move a single gate as they came, so drafting into two lots. See double gate. Cattle are usually now drafted in a stock-yard  (q.v.). See also shed. (G.P. W.) (ii) A number of stock sent for  sale, e.g. `The annual Stonyhurst draft of four-year-old ewes will be offered.' When the draft is actually offered it is usually spoken of as a line. ([1898 Morris Austral-English])
