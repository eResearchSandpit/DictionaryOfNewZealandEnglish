Quote:  Daggy boys relieve the grey... Te Nana and his great friend and sevens comrade Eric Rush are living proof that even in a game that can get as grim and grey as rugby, there's still room for the daggy boy... How daggy is that? To be fair, though, there's no records of him ever playing in a black singlet and gumboots... Wilson, a true daggy boy, is a man who often jokes about his own playing abilities but his team mates didn't like him just because he was funny.
