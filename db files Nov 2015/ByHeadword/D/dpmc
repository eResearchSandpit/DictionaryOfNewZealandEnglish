Quote: The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) has, at times, managed to ace the other two because its boss is <i>the</i> boss. Under this government, the Treasury has had everything confiscated but its calculators, and the DPMC is less a department than a secretariat to a very determined PM.
