Quote: Cliff was a hard case. He knew lots of yarns too. He'd always start by saying `Did you hear theone about ...?' He didn't seem to like telling them when Norman was there, but he told me some corkers after. He was a real wag. It was good fun going round with him. <i>Ibid</i>. 80 `He's a wag,' said Cliff, `that Johnny Nelson. He's like Hoot Gibson in the pictures.'

Quote: She was always told that dag was  Southland rhyming slang for wag, which latter seemed to her mostly used in the North Island at any rate. But the early use (now obs) of Dag! as an expletive (related to Doggon!), from  1917 and Dag at `a dab at' may have some bearing on reinforcement. The probable origin is in EDD n2., v2. 11. a daring feat among boys Ches w Mid w Som: e.g. Som `set a dag: perform some feat in such a way as to challenge imitation ... saying: `There's a dag for you ... do it if you can.'' 12. have or make a dag at `have a shot at'; OED2 sb&sup5. esp.  doing dags, 1879. The earliest non-extant usage may have referred to an event, rather than a person, out of the ordinary, rather than vice-versa as the present evidence might suggest.

Quote: Lambie appears, to my homosexual gaze, as a mumsy sort of woman, with the tang of Taranaki about her (I mean here the odour of 'a good sport', 'a dag', with something well-meaning and ingenuous in her manner).
