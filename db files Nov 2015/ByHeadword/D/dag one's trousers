Quote: The well-dressed hillman always dagged his trousers. No - the men who worked with sheep didn't imitate their woolly work's sanitary habits. Dagging trousers is cutting off the cuffs to give a nice tatty trouser leg which would get even tattier on the job thanks to spaniards and wild irishmen - spear grass and Matagouri.
