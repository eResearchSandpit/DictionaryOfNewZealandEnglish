Quote: CAPE WEED (<i>Cryptostemma calendulaceum</i> [1967] <i>Calendula</i>) or Cape daisy is abundant in pastures and waste places in the North Island and is also recorded from Greymouth. It is a soft herb, rarely a foot high. ... This weed comes from Cape Colony and so is properly called `Cape Weed'. The same name is given to cats-ear, a much more common weed.
