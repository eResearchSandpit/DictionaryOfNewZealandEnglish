Quote: In later years we had stockyards at different parts of the Station where the drafting was done. The cattle were driven up a narrow race, with double gates at the further end, which were worked by a man standing on a platform. These yards were specially built for handling wild cattle, and had narrow gaps between the hinge of the drafting gate and post, through which a man could escape from a charging beast.

Quote: DRAFTING: The main feature of sheepyards is the drafting race. This race, perhaps eight yards in length, is only wide enough for sheep to pass through in single file; at the end of the race are two swinging gates which can be manipulated to turn the sheep into different yards, and so separate them into different `lines' or mobs.
