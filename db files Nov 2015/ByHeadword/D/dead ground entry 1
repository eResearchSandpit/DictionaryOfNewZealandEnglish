Quote: Dead ground? Yeah, dead ground is the country in hollows and between ridges that you can't see when you're looking at something a long way off, like those mountains there. Distances are very deceptive in this sort of country. You can travel all day towards a landmark and never seem to get any closer. Then bang, you're suddenly there. Something to do with dead ground I suppose.
