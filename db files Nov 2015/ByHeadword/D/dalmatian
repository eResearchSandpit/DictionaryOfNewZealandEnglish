Quote: We told everyone that we were Dalmatians and later Yugoslavs and we all stated this with pride - after all, this respect had been earned with much sweat and just as many tears, in the gold fields of the South, on the wild gum fields of the North and in the mountains of Coromandel and in the swamps and drains of the Hauraki Plains. There was a time when the distinction in our community, between a Yugoslav and a Dalmatian was alomost impossible to discern.
