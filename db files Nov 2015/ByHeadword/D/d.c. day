Quote: Monday the 10th of July 1967 is a significant date in New Zealand history, as this was the day New Zealand officially changed from GBP. s. d., to a decimal currency. [42] In the build-up to 'D.C.Day' as it was called, the Government ran an extensive publicity campaign to prepare, inform, educate and reassure the public.
