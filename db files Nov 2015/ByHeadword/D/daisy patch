Quote: There [on 5 May 1915 in the front line] survivors were ordered to cross an exposed strip of ground, frosted with spring daisies, before [the Turk-held hill] Achi Baba - a place long to be cursed as `The daisy patch'. ... The daisies were soon less conspicuous than the blackening blood of dead and dying New Zealanders as more and more were urged across the open ground. ... After the daisy patch, demoralisation and anger was as rampant among New Zealand officers as among men.
