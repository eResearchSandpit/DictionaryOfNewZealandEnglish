Quote: This is an indeterminate sentence, and can only be given to a man who has ben declared an Habitual Criminal. ... Unless the `Act' is lifted from him by a judge of the Supreme Court it will continue in force for the rest of his life. Among convicts this particular sentence is  known as the `dog collar' for obvious reasons.
