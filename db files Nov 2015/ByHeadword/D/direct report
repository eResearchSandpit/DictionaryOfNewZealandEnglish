Quote: After becoming aware of the relationship, organisational development manager Joe Guthrie wrote to [him] saying the company would not condone a personal relationship between a manager and a "direct report"... The authority held that [he] had been unjustifiably dismissed as "no fair and reasonable employer could have concluded that he had committed serious misconduct simply for failing to acknowledge that he had exercised poor judgment in entering into a relationship with a direct report, particularly after that direct report had resigned."
