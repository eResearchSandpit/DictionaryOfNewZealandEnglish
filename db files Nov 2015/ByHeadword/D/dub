Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. [175] Here is Little Ring as played in Waitara, Taranaki, in 1899: A team would consist of six to eight boys [order of shooting determined] ... An oval ring was decribed in the earth by means of a stick, and each player would `dub in' one marble ... A line was drawn some six or eight feet away, as the firing line, and the first player sang out `Fire!' as he fired the first shot.]
