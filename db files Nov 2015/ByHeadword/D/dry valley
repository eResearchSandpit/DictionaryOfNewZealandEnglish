Quote: Transecting the Transantarctic Mountains west of McMurdo Sound are three ice and snow-free valleys collectively called the Dry Valleys. The valleys extend from the 2,750 m Polar Plateau in the west to within a short distance of the sea. Along with some smaller subsidiary valleys the system constitutes the largest ice-free area in Antarctica, a total of approximately 4,000 square km.

Quote: The Dry Valleys were originally discovered in 1903 by Scott, Evans and Lashly and since the rediscovery by geologists Peter Webb and Barrie McKelvey in 1957, the work of summer field parties, including geologists, chemists and physicists, led to the decision to winter at Vanda Station.
