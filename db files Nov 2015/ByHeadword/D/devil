Quote: An old native, from whose ear a large shark's tooth was hanging as an ornament, on being questioned by me as to the danger to which they were exposed while in the water from those animals, replied, that `the missionaries had told him that the converts need be under no apprehension of danger from them, but that the `dewaras' (devils) or unbelievers would certainly be devoured.' ... On being answered in the negative, he appeared satisfied; at the same timecomplaining, that the missionaries did not treat him with due respect, but called him a `devil,' because he would not be converted.
