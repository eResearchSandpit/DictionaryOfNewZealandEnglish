Quote: The name of the operation, Tri, was an obscure play on words dreamed up by a rugby-loving detective boss, linked to the handy "drop boxes" in banks that were exploited during the scam... As "tri" means three, a "drop-kick" is worth three points... But the case became better known as the "drop-box scam".
