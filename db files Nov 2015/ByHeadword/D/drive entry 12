Quote: In London the swells in the park drive all round, But the diggers drive here with a pick underground; And the props that they use, surely everyone knows Ain't the same used in London for hanging up clothes. The women use fans* there, the men use them here, Though to cockneys that statement may sound very queer, And the fellows that frequently hang round hotels,  Out here are called loafers, at home are called swells.  <i>Ibid.</i> [p 89 fn] * A fan is a machine for pumping air down the shafts.
