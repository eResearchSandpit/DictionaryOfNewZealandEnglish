Quote: The unusual animals - a kind of circular starfish - store food in their feet, have no stomach and live in a soup of bacteria in the holes of wood lying 1000 metres under the sea ...  Dr Baker said last night he proposed to call the class sea daisies - after their daisy-like shape. ...  The sea discovery is the highlight of a marine ecosystem ... which museum scientists here recently found.
