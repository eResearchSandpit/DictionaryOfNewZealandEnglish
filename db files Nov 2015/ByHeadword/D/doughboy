Quote: Nor do you get much more Victorian (or rather Elizabethan) than the miti-miti or dough-boy dumpling which comes with the Paua Bar's boil-up, along with the usual meaty pork bones, some nicely cooked kumara and potato, a little of the cooking juices, and puha - or in this case watercress, lightly boiled in deference to modern tastes.
