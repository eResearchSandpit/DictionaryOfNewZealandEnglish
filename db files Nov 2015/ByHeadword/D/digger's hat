Quote: I must say, [the bushmen] were the most picturesque of the party, being ... dressed in red flannel shirts and leathern knickerbockers and gaiters; they ... wore `diggers' hats,' a head-dress of American origin - a sort of wide-awake made of plush, capable of being crushed into any shape,and very becoming.
