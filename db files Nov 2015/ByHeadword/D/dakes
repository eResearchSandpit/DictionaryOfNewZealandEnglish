Quote: Marbles.. was played with those beautiful and beautifully named taws such as agaties, cat's-eyes and glassies (glassies were to be found in the tops of lemonade bottles) and with the small clay cannon-fodder called dakes. You knocked your opponent's dakes out of the ring with your taw, and then you could keep them.
