Quote: Higher up, upon the rocky summits, however, we cannot mistake  <i>Senecio saxifragoides </i>, with its broad hairy leaves and bunches of bright yellow daisy flowers, a handsome plant which might be called the `yellow rock-daisy,' and which is peculiarly a Canterbury plant, being found only on the hills of Banks Peninsula, and rarely in the Kaikouras.
