Quote: On one occasion I was mustering some newly-captured deer into the race and dark shed of one of our traps and by necessity. [99] In building your trap include the wing and race leading to the dark shed, and situate the dark shed so that a vehicle can be driven up to the outside. Deer will go down a race into a dark hole of natural appearance ... we built races and sheds.
