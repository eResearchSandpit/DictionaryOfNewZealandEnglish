Quote: By the early 1900s dama were believed to be extinct on the Australian mainland, but DNA tests proved that the dama that Governor Grey released on Kawau in 1870 were originally taken from South Australia, and therefore a pure strain of the lost species. Kawau dama (Aussies say "tammar") are now an international star for forensic genetics, but it won't save them.
