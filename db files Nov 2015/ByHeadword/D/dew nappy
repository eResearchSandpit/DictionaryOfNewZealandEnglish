Quote: Fred has the `pensions' used for fantan, round metal discs with a square hole in the middle, and  a`dew nappy', the ivory half-ball that the game was played with. Pensions were put on the four corners of the card, or points between, and two people took the bank. Even money was paid on the corners and three to one in the middle. There would be several hundred pounds sometimes waiting on the half-roll of the dew nappy.
Notes: Check with DMcG whether he means to refer to fantan or to a game dew nappy.
