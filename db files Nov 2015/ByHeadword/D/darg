Quote: For a good many years I have run a daily column in the Southland Daily News called "The Day's Darg," a mixture of fact, comment, verse and humour. "Darg" is a coalmining term meaning a norm of work.Theoretically, when you have finished your darg, you go home, but somehow that has never worked for me.
