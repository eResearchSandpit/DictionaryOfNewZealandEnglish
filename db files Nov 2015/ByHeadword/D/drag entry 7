Quote: These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver andground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain,and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.
