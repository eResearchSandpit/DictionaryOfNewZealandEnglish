Quote: Often it is necessary to construct costly dams to impound the water in the upper parts of the creek, in order that it may be suddenly liberated ... so that the entire assemblage [332] of [kauri] logs may be `driven' to the booms. In dry seasons the logs may remain in the bed of the creek for months, and, occasionally, after a successful `drive', the harvest of logs is carried out tosea and lost, through the booms breaking from the immense pressure behind them.
