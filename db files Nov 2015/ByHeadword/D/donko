Quote: May I suggest the inclusion of the word `Donko' in any subsequent edition of your New Zealand  Dictionary. The word, which appears to mean `the lunch room or similar facilities for workers in a factory'. The word appears to have fairly wide usage in New Zealand and I have spoken to several Australians and found them unaware of it. It do not know the origin of the term and would be grateful if any of your etymologists can enlighten me.
