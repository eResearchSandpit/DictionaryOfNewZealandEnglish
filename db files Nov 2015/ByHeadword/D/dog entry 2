Quote: In the simplest form of Tip Cat the players competed to see who could hit the cat farthest. The cat was a thin, six-inch stick with pointed ends. Their bat (or dog) was a round stick about the size of a cricket wicket (two and a half feet long). The cat was placed on the ground, tapped on its point, and then as it jumped up into the air, hit once more.
