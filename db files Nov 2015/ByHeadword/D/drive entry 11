Quote: Harry had just given the last cut of the axe to a big rimu, which, after a far premonitory cracks as it began to move, fell, driving before it in its line of fall a dozen or so of the smaller trees, which had been `scarfed' or cut partly through in readiness, and skilfully, so that each, when struck, might again in its turn strike and bring down another. The noise of a fall or drive of this kind is like thunder - loud, prolonged, reverberating.

Quote: It was quite a common practice for experienced bushmen, to have a `drive'. If you are chopping up a `face' and there is a large tree behind you further up the face, you select that as the `key'. To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree. When all is ready and you have worked back to the key, you scarf it verycarefully. ... If everything goes according to plan it will `drive' the one below, which will in turn drive the next, and so on ...

Quote: A `drive' was in progress; as the men do the underscrubbing they note the large trees and their distance from each other. They scarf each one so that it will fall on the next. Then, after all the smaller timber has been brought down, they fell the first tree which falls on the second and so starts a whole sequence of crashes. The line need not be straight. More often, it zig-zags from right to left. Bushmen can do wonders by means of an ingenious drive.
