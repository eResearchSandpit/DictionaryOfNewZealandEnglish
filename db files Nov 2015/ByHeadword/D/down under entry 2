Quote: [A US writer] The little Dominion of New Zealand is the more or less happy land popularly known as `Down Under.' ... It is doubtful whether the origin of the term `Down Under' will ever be known. It first came into general use during the World War of 1914-18, when the New Zealanders who fought in the ill-starred Gallipoli campaign were referred to as `the men from Down Under', but that was not the start of it. This faraway land, it seems, was known as `Down Under' in some parts of England and Scotland before the birth of the present century. The first World War merely [put] the expression into wider usage. An Auckland artist, Mr Trevor Lloyd,made it the subject of one of his cartoons at the very beginning of that great upheaval, and at least one English war correspondent used the term when writing on Gallipoli. After the year 1918 the expression fell into disuse, but during the second World War it again became popular, and I think we must thank the Americans for its revival. ... In England it is also known as the Antipodes.
