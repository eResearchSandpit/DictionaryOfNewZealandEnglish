Quote: "...that was the first time I was a Dirty Dirty for a team, but I think I'm a better person for it... It's made me think back to the guys who were the Dirty Dirties in those teams and the jobs they did." Being  Dirty Dirty is a thankless job. During the week the unwanted players are used as cannon fodder for the team, running in defence at training and trying to simulate a game atmosphere without (of course) injuring the guys playing in their place. Closer to the match they have to disappear, to give the playing 22 a bit of space, then on game day they are used for everything from ferrying bags to picking up the dirty playing gear after the game.

Quote: He has to carry a lot of the burden as a dirty-dirty. He has done a lot of work for us in simulating opposition lineouts and he has run the reserves really well against the pack.

Quote: Greg Somerville - 6.32.  Another player who spent most of his time among the dirty dirties.  Did start in two games but failed to do anything startling.
