Quote: Dust: Quartz dust was a major menace to the health of miners. It blocked up the microscopic air-sacs in the lungs, producing hardening of the tissues and impairing the function of the lungs. Eventually, sometimes after many years, death resulted. The disease miners' phthisis was commonly called `the dust.' It gradually came to an end after the indroduction of axial-water-feed drills.
