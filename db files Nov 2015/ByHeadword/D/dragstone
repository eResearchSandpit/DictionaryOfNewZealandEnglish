Quote: Buhman further casts doubt on the so-called `dragstone,' theposition of which influenced prospecting for the lost portion, and doubts its value as an index to the direction of movement; he mentions that drag quartz diminished when followed up the fault-plane and along the strike of the fault, whereas the amount of dragstone should have increased as the lost portion of the ore-body was approached.

Quote: ... i.e., that the continuation of the lode was relatively upthrown south-west of the fault, as appeared to be suggested by the up-turning of the lode against the fault and drag-stone. ... The channel may be offset, but dragstone should indicate in which direction to seek.
Notes: (Gage, Reefton)
