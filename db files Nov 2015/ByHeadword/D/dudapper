Quote: While presenting a programme on Radio Sport recently, I asked listeners what a "dudapper" was... Eventually, one caller came up with the correct answer : a dudapper was once the term used to describe a delivery that bounced twice before reaching the batsman. Shortly after, an elderly gentleman rang in to say that when he was a youngster playing school cricket in England, a team-mate by the name of Nipper Dingle made a specialty of such a delivery. I distinctly remember," said the caller, " our master taking us for practices and saying, 'I've never seen a boy who could bowl a dudapper like you, Nipper Dingle.'"
