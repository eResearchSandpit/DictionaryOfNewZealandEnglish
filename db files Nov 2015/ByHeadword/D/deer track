Quote: In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both track and trail and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and  trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper,  I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime deer track still seems to be used far more than deer trail.
