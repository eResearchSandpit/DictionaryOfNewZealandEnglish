Quote: The game of Dumpy `was played on a space about the size of a tennis court and divided into three sections. There were six (often more) players, two on each section. Each player had a whipand each pair had to stick to its own section. When the top was whipped over the back line, that gave a point to that team' Taranaki, 1880).
