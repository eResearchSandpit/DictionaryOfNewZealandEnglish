Quote: This is where the diaspora comes in. It is our insurance policy against isolation and Erewhonitis - and why it's possible to stop spooking ourselves about people leaving.

Quote: My guess the use may have come out of the Knowledge Wave Conference of 2001, precipitated by the parallel with the Irish Diaspora, which is thought to have contributed to the revival of the Irish economy. (The numbers however are very different400,000 NZers against 70m of Irish descent.) The Irish use may be recent too, perhaps as a result of Mary O'Regan(?) president of Ireland who made a major speech  (about 1990 I think) in which she said that Ireland should reach out to its emigrants. Coming out of the KWC, there has been formed KEA (Kiwi Expatriates Association) to harness our diaspora for New Zealand's benefit.
