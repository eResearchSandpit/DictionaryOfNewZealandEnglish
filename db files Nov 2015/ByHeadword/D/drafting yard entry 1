Quote:  `I will conclude this part of the subject with a few words about stockyards. They are generally made of stout posts and rails; the corner posts ought to be much stronger than the rest, as they often have to bear the weight of a heavy bullock in branding and other operations. The yard is generally divided into three portions - viz., a large yard for the whole herd, a drafting yard, and a milking yard, at one end of which is placed the milking shed, cow bails, and calf house, the whole being so arranged that a calf can be let out to suck its mother on one side while she is being milked on the other.'
