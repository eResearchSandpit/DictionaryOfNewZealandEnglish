Notes: It is difficult to find "dairy" clearly used in the sense of a small mixed shop before 1943 ("cash grocer" seems to have been the usual term), the following sequence does seem to indicate the change in use from "dairy" as a supplier of milk (often with several depots around the town) to "dairy" meaning a mixed shop. The shop in Upland Road, Kelburn, was run in 1938 as a confectionary shop (cnfr); in 1939 it is listed in both Wise's and the Wellington telephone directory as "dairy" and is the only small shop listed under "Dairies" in the classified section which uses "dairy" in its trade name.

Quote: In Auckland a large number of shops close on Saturday... The result is that all these little dairies have arisen . In a city in which the milk is delivered every morning, irrespective of the dairies, there are twenty-nine dairies in one road. It  is not milk they are selling, but groceries.
