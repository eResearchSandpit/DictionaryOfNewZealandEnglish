Quote: There are upwards of two thousand British subjects now settled in different parts of the islands, of whom several hundreds consist of a most worthless class of persons, - such as runaway sailors, convicts who have escaped from New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, keepers of grog-shops and other vagabonds of dissolute habits; who ... practise fraud ... promote and take part in wars ... have infected the natives with disease and a taste for ardent spirits. They really deserve a name which has been given them, `Devil's Missionaries.'
