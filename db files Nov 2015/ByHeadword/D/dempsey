Quote: This would read "<b>dempsey</b> <i> n.</i> 1. an outrageous bluff designed to explain the unexplainable. 2.  an own goal. 3. a bizarre suicide attempt assisted by legal advice. 4. an egregious joke.<i> v.t.</i> minimise the effects of an appalling error of judgment ((<i>That nuclear bomb we just dropped on Paris, I had no idea these things could do so much damage.</i>) (f. early 21st-century soccer administrator with too many lawyers and an irrational fear of fax messages)"...Charlie would simply stand his ground, and take the custard pies while reducing the nmedia to fits of laughter with a steady stream of prepared dempsies. For example, in explaining the millions of dollars being tossed away through public servants living in Auckland and flying to work in Wellington, the likely dempsey would be :"It prevents their being delayed on the northern motorway."
