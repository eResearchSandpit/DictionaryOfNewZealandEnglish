Quote: The first [cruelty] has been there for truly as long as I can remember: a small, weatherboard shed, which you hope might be used to store a lawnmower, rakes, spades, axes, a wheelbarrow, perhaps some firewood or bags of coal, but in fact is the Omanu Primary School dental clinic... The bell rang at three o'clock - my worst memory of school is being called to the dental clinic one afternoon at five to three.
