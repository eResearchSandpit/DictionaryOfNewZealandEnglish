Quote: In the rural districts [of New Zealand] a formidable body of idiomatic uses is developing and a new language is being coined. This isno more true than it is of the `remote' back-country of Canterbury, where changing vocabulary is already a noticable geographical characteristic. The local idiom is naturally often linked with sheep, wool, and station practice. `Dag', for example, is a word used first to describe a tuft of wool fouled by excrement. The removal of dags from the hind-quarters of sheep is a seasonal operation usually called `crutching.' Used personally, `dag' was earlier a term of some approbation.  Its meaning has widened, however, and now signifies no more than `hard case', or `tough guy', or `card.'
