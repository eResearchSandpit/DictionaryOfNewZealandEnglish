Quote: During the [1890] strike about 100 seamen unattached in Port Chalmers stayed in hotels and boarding houses, but a large number of them found residence in the "baches" in what was called "Sweat Rag Alley", consisting of a number of small baches or cribs in a double row where the Corporation Yard now is. Each bach housed three or four men and it was said that each man had a dog. From this fact, the area became known as "Dogtown".

Quote: To the uninitiated this may mean nothing, but, to those in the know, the quickest way to cause a riot and to raise an insurrection is to call an inhabitant of Port Chalmers a dweller in Dogtown.

Quote: There are two explanations for the term Dog Town. The first has its clue in the name of the town, Port Chalmers, which obviously had a lot of docks. As with the Isle of Dogs in London, there is a belief that in the old days the docks of Port Chalmers caused it to be referred to as Dock Town, and the word became corrupted. But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs. Most of these men lived in cottages in George Street which became known locally as Dog Town and the name spread to mean Port Chalmers in general. It's occasionally heard even today.

Quote: And during the troubles [sc. an 1890 strike] , about 100 seamen from other ports stayed in baches in an area called 'Sweat Rag Alley' in Port Chalmers. I t was said that each resident there had a dog - and the name 'Dogtown' unfortunately stuck to the Borough for a long time.
