Quote: Puzzled, we hear of `Deep Thinkers'. A member of the 5th Reinforcements, nearing the last of the volunteer New Zealand soldiers because `the rush to the colours' in this war was much more subdued, was heard to observe: `Yes, I must admit I did some deep thinking before joining up.' From then to the end of World War Two, the 5th Reinforcements were known as the `Deep Thinkers'.
