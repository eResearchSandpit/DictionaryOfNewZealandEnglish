Quote: By 4.30 a.m. on December 19 [1915], the last beetle cleared from the shore leaving the `Diehards' of the Division, only 3,000 strong, to hold the line against a mighty army. ... [286] The `last ditchers' were to be sacrificed for the army. There was no lack of volunteers. ... men of Anzac and Suvla alike - vied with each other in an endeavour to become included in the `Diehards'. [288] Previous parties had taken the `Diehards' kits and impedimenta.
