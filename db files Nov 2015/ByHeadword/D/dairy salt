Quote: Specks may also be occasioned by the use of impure salt, which, if it contains lime or free soda, will combine with the butter and make a soap in spots where particles of the salt may have been left undissolved. Using only the best dairy salt, or in case of common salt carefully crushing the salt, mixing it well with the butter, and, after letting it stand for 24 hours, again working and mixing, will prevent it.
