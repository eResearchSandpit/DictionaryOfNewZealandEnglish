Quote: After a number of years, when sheep were mustered in from the back ranges, it was noticed that several would die in the yards ..., for they would require to be kept in for drafting on the following day. These dead sheep would be mostly sheep which had missed a shearing, and were double-fleeced, having very long wool.
