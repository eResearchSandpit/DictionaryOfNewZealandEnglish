Notes: (children's game) 1952 June 7 R. Mason letter (Wellington) Den To Den 1920 Pukekohe School A game played by the girls at Pukekohe School. The seats along the wall of the school and the seats on the opposite side of the narrow playground are dens. The players run across from den to den whenever they see a good chance to avoid being caught by whoever is `it'. A player who is caught then becomes `it' immediately.
