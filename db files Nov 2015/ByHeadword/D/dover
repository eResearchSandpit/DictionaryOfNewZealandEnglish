Quote: Dover: [1898 Morris Austral-English] gives the meaning as a clasp knife. George McMillan, who came out in 1858, told me that when he arrived it was the custom for hands to find theirown knife, fork, spoon, plate, and pannikin, which were all called dovers. A man would offer work for `a pound a week and the run of my dovers'. The expression died out in Canterbury before 1860.

Quote: Once, in lamenting inevitable changes, a runholder exclaimed, `I wish I were back in a maimai with a plate of bark and a dover!' The saying then [ca1870] in engaging a hand was `so much a week and the run of the dover.' The dover was a Dover knife, and the `run of the dover' was as as much food as one could eat.

Quote: dover: An old brand of hand shears, and soon used as another name for the shears themselves, hence such terms as `the run of your dover' and flashing your dover'. [This needs checking. He may have go this from Wilkes.]
