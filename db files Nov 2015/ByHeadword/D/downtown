Notes: Jim writes: NSOD tags this as <i>chiefly NAmer</i>, Collins as <i>US, Canadian & NZ</i>. All OED citations are North American or refer to North America, except one from Australia in 1969. A <i>New Scientist</i> article in 1966 found it necessary to translate the word for English readers. However, I have recently heard and read it in British TV programmes and publications with reference e.g to Adelaide and Santiago. Is it used of British cities and since when? It has been common in NZ at least since the 70s esp but not solely in relation to Auckland and Wellington.
