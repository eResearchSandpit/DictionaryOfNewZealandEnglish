Quote: For a "dead zone", Tinui seems remarkably alive and kicking. ... A year ago <i>Sunday Star Times</i> visited the tiny Wairarapa settlement not long after it was designated as one of 160 "low employment locations" (better known as dead zones or no-go areas) by Work and Income, meaning that people could not move there and receive a benefit.
