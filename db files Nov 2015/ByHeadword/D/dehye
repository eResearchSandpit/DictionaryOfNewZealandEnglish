Quote: The second dilemma for the cook is trying to make dehydrated foods not taste like dehydrated foods. Meat substitutes should be avoided, but faced with packets of risottos, chow meins, peas, soups, curries and flavourings, you would surely think that something else would emerge that would not inevitably taste like `dehye'. But you would be wrong.
