Quote: During recent years a new piece of educational jargon has become current in New Zealand - `daylight training' of apprentices. It is a phrase that is not known in England, where the words `daytime release' are used as a label to a process parallel, though not identical with, that now developing here. ... It became current in New Zealand during the hearings of the Commission of Inquiry into Apprenticeship and Related Matters, 1944, and has continued in use though the wording of the Apprentices' Act does not include it [but uses] `technical training during working hours.'
Notes: (H.C. McQueen, Commissioner of Apprenticeship)
