Quote: New rushes are spoken of every day, and the township which has sprung up is full of life and excitement caused by the crowds of diggers, packers, and storekeepers, all anxiously awaiting the latest intelligence to be off for "pastures new" on the Golden Grey. Affairs will not take their usual course if we do not have numbers coming back to the Hokitika, loudly declaring the whole thing a "duffer"and a "sell."

Quote: ... our claim proved a `duffer'. No less than fifteen shafts did we sink ..., but found a prospect of nothing sufficient to encourage us in working it. <i>Ibid.</i> 121 [Prospective diggers] had only arrived to find the whole thing what  is called in digging parlance a `duffer' - i.e., that there was comparatively `nothing' to repay them for even the trouble of digging a single hole.

Quote: DUFFER: applied to a rush, a shaft, or a claim generally. A failure. Synonyms were `shicer',`stringer' or, in the case of a false rush, `store-keepers' rush'. A claim which was exhausted was said to be `duffered out'. At Ross in 1866 putting down a duffer shaft was termed `sinking for the Queen'. Duffers (Creek) is a common West Coast place-name.

Quote: If a man isn't `up to the mark' he is called `a regular shicer!' This phrase originated from the gold diggings. Supposing a man is digging, but without success, andhe therefore abandons his hole, it is called a `shicer' - that is, the ground was called a `shicer' or duffer, thus the origin.
