Quote: A number of Parrotfish (they do not live in schools) were following me around and picking up the broken off crayfish legs. The Banded Parrotfish is the most common in the shallows - it blends in with the seaweed - but deeper down the Sandaggers Parrotfish and the Scarlet Parrotfish, often called the `deep sea spotty', take over.
