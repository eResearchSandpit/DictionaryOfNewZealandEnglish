Quote: Magistrates courts were renamed district courts and their presiding judges district court judges in 1981, but the term magistrate in New Zealand denoted stipendiary magistrates rather than justices of the peace, who were and are usually referred to simply as justices or JPs. (District court has itself a history.  Originally district courts were intermediate courts created in 1858; they were squeezed out between the Supreme Court (now the High Court) and the magistrates courts and were formally abolished in 1925.) The latest episode of this serial is the creation in 1998 of community magistrates to sit in district courts and exercise minor criminal jurisdiction.
