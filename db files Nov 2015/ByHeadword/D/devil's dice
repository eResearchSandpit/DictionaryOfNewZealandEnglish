Quote: So when I wasn't reading any novels I could lay my hands on I was filling myself up with Gordon's  Mining and Engineering and Miner's Guide and back numbers of the Mines Department's annual reports, the  New Zealand Mines Record and all the rest of it. Before long I could have written you a dictionary from adit to winze and what I didn't know about dredges, hydraulic sluices, alluvial mines, lodes, faults, throws, heaves, slides, blocking out, stopes, dollies, devil's dice and drills could have gone on the back of a halfpenny stamp.
