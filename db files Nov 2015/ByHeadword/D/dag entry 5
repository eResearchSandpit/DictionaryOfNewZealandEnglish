Quote: Lange came back from Australia after the debacle of two MPs who had supported him in his drive last year for the leadership fulminating that in Australia `the dags did not wag the sheep' in the Labour Party.  The inescapable inference from that is that here the sheep is being wagged by the dags (a choice of phrase hardly likely to enthuse those accused of doing the wagging).
