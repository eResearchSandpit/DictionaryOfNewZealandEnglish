Quote: In shape, [the family Trachypteridae] are usually long, deep, and very much compressed and flattened on the sides, so much so that their local appellations always embody some idea of these peculiarities - such as ribband-fish, lath or deal fish, band fish or blade fish, and also oar-fish.

Quote: The Oar-fish, 12 to 20 feet long, with a high, flame-tipped  head-crest (the elongated fin rays) is probably the sea-serpent of repute. Its pelvic fins are narrow, elongated processes, hence the name Oar-fish. The Deal-fish is much smaller, but of the same type, but we know very little of the habits of either of them.
