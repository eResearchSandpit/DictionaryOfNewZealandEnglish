Quote: It is possible to get as much liquor as one wants in Masterton, and while much of it (privately and legitimately brought in) is of good quality, much more (surreptitiously dispensed at sly-groggeries and by what are locally termed `droppers' at enhanced prices) is atrocious and harmful liquor. ...A Masterton gentleman ... told our representative that the knew of twenty sly-groggeries in Masterton, and double that number of `droppers.' It can be imagined what kind of poison they dispense.
