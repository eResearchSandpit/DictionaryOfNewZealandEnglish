Notes: Jim Cameron writes: Individual properties are <i>lots</i> on such a plan and so described on the title. Eg "[20 perches] more or less being part of section 32 Karori District and being Lot 4 on Deposited Plan 8018..." Note pre-metric NZ use of <i>perch</i> to define area. NSOD describes this use as "more fully, square perch ... now rare exc. hist". Until 1968 perch (never square perch) was standard in legal and popular use to describe the area of sections smaller than a quarter-acre.
