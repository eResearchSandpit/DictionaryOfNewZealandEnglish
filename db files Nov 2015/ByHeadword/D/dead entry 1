Quote: This big joker say to me, `Listen, mate, that horse has got no show. He is dead.' I say, `He is not dead. I can see him now and he looks very much alive.' He then say, `I don't mean he is dead that way, but he is not a jigger. He is going to be hooked, pulled and run into the ground.' <i>Ibid.</i> 32  He won't start. ... Dad backed him last week and he told Mum he was dead.
