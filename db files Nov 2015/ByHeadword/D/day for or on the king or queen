Quote: When you wake up in the morning in a mustering hut and hear the rain beating on the roof someone is sure to poke his head out of the door and look around and say: `Its a day for the Kingboys!' I don't know how this saying originated but it means a day of enforced idleness; often very welcome after a run of fine weather.

Quote: The next day being wet, all [mustering] hands stayed in camp - a `Day for the King', but not for the poor cook trying to prepare their meals over an open fire in the rain.

Quote: As well as superstitions, the whalers of Tory Channel had a few time-honoured habits. One of these was known as `a-day-for-the-Queen'. Its main application seems to have been when a whaler had had a heavy day on the grog and had butterflies in his stomach and head the nextday in the form of a hangover. If, for example, a harpoon-gunner like Trevor Norton was to have`a-day-for-the-Queen', he would be on a kind of half-alert. After a solid day on the booze he might find a nice, quiet bunk on board the Perano mother ship  Tuatea, where he could nestle down rather than being on lookout duty up on the hill.
