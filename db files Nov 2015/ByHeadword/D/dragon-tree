Quote: We  met with a great many Cabbage-palmtrees, [Cordyline australis] as they were commonly called by our Sailors, but upon Examination we found them to be a kind of  Dragon tree (Dracaena Linn): for we met with the fruit and flowers of them. <i>Ibid.</i> May 13 2/277[?nikau???] ... an infinite variety of high trees & shrubbery [in Dusky Bay], among which theNew-Zeeland Dragon-tree  (Dracaena antarctica) [ed. fn Cordyline australis] is very remarkable; (NB Our Sailors called them the Cabbage-palm, but it is different; though the middle most leaves may be eaten & taste almost like sweet fresh Almonds).

Quote: [??=nikau] These trees, however, were not the true cabbage-palms, nor did they belong at all to the class of palms, ... They were properly speaking a new species of dragon-trees, with broad leaves (dracaena australis) of which the central shoot when quite tender, tastes something like an almond's kernel, with a little of the flavour of cabbage.

Quote: A species of Dragon-tree, the central shoot of which partook at once both of the flavour of cabbage and of an almond kernel. <i>Ibid.</i> 2/247 [=??nikau, though prob. Cordyline cabbage as Andersen says: Nicholas ref. to Forster 1/176 above] They [Cook's people] found here also ... a new species of dragon-tree, the central shoot of which partook at once both of the flavour of cabbage and of an almond kernel.

Quote: I here first saw the great Dracophyllum; it formed a small tree about six inches in diameter, and twenty feet high; it is one of the most curious plants in the world; the leaves grow in tufts at the ends of the branches, just as in the dragon tree (Dracaena), and are the same shape, but in this species they are elegantly reflexed, like the feathers of a soldier's plume; they are a foot long and an inch broad at the base.
