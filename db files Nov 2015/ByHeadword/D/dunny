Notes: ca1910 at least W.H.B. Orsman vide the `Old King Cole' rhyme extant when he was a schoolboy. A version of the rhyme had been applied earlier to one Blackburn, the Havelock nightcartman. Old King Cole was a merry old soul/ And a merry old soul was he;/ He called for a light in the middle of the night/ To go to the W.C./ The wind blew round the dunny door,/ The candle took a fit,/ Old King Cole fell down the hole/ And came up covered in shit.
