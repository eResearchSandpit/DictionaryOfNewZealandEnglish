Quote: 'The Dallies don't need a compass,' they'd say. 'All they need is to be able to recognise Rangitoto. They never go out of sight of it.' While there may have been a small amount of truth in the jibe in the 1930s, when the 'Dally fleet' was inclined to be the butt of jokes by other members of the fishing community, it was not the case in the 1940s.
