Quote: At the farmers' instigation, in 1922 the Government set up a Meat Board, and a year later, though there was in this case some opposition from farmers, a Dairy Board. These Boards were made up chiefly of producers' representatives, though with a few Government members, and were empowered to control the export trade.
