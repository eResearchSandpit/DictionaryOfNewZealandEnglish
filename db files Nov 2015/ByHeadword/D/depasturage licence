Quote: When the selection [of the N.Z. Company share of the Otago Block] had been made the Crowngrant was to be issued, and there was an understanding that if Colonel Wakefield desired stillmore land he was to have it. This was the origin of what was afterwards known as thedepasturage licences, under which settlers were authorised to run cattle and sheep in the adjoining districts. <i>Ibid.</i> 138-139 Under the original terms, land purchasers were entitled upon payment of an annual license fee of 10s. 6d. to depasture or run sheep and cattle upon such waste lands within the block as remained unappropriated. ... though Captain Cargill was then gazetted Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Otago block only, he received no definite instructions upon the subject of granting the runs. [139] The result was that he merely filed the applications for depasturage licenses as they were presented to him, whilst the applicants were left to pursue their further course as seemed best to them.
