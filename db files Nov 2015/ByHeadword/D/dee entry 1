Quote: We were well mounted, and all our luggage consisted of my little travelling-bag ... and what is termed a `swag' in front of F--'s saddle; that is, a long narrow bundle, in this instance enclosed in a neat waterproof case, and fastened with two straps to the `D's,' which are the steel loops let in in four places to all colonial saddles, for the purpose of carrying blankets, &c.; they derive their name apparently from their resemblance to the letter.
