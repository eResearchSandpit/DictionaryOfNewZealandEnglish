Notes: Jim Cameron writes: NSOD gives the general sense, but the words (dry area) and several compounds have considerable historic significance in NZ from the 1890s almost up to the the present. DNZE does not record these - wet/dry area, district, vote; go wet, stay dry. NZPOD has no entry for wet in this sense but does for dry.
