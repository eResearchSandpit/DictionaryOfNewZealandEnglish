Quote: When Martin came back from seeing her off, the family were all sitting round the fire. `She was a nice little dourigan, I thought,' his father said. ... `But what on earth is a dourigan?' Joe asked. ... `It's the word we used back home for a little potato,' his father said; but his father's smile was only teasing and there were much worse words in his Irish vocabulary.
