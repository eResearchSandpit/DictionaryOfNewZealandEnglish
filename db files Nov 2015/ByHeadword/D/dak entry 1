Quote: [Hdg] Dak and ruin amid mass inhalations.... New Zealand First's Ron Mark suggested that, since the Government was happy to back compulsory testing of police and defence personnel, it should set an example by introducing compulsory drug-testing of MPs and staff. "Or are we to allow Parliament to go to dak and ruin", he added., mystifying more innocent members with his pun on one of the many cool slang names for marijuana.

Quote: So, when Ron Mark MP suggested drug testing our elected representatives in the wake of the latest joint-spotted-in-House brouhaha - memorably punning a threat of things going "to dak and ruin" in the process - it was unclear to an irony-challenged individual like myself whether he was serious.
