Light posts (about 3 ft. 6 in. in height) are arranged in pairs, crosswise, so as to form a fork about 18 in. from the top. Each fork supports a rail, which is laid slantwise and plaited in and out among the three or four neighbouring supports, its lower end being driven into the ground. Sometimes the whole is capped with a horizontal rail, laid from fork to fork.

Quote: There was no fencing wire in those days [in Auckland ca1865] so we had to make what is called a `dog-leg fence'. This was composed of stakes driven crossways in the ground and the long sticks laid with one end on the ground and the other end on the crossed stakes.

Quote: The dog-leg fence, found in North America only in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, reappeared in the Nova Scotian settlement at Waipu, and from there spread to some other bush settlements in the north. It was constructed by driving two crossing stakes into the ground, and in the notch of these placing a third rail which followed the direction of the fence ... It was claimed that it would keep out cattle, but the fence was never widely adopted probably because of its tendency to get out of repair easily.
