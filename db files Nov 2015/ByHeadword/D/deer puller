Quote: These crosses [sc. greyhound-collie/terrier, etc], sometimes euphemistically called lurchers, areexcellent deer-pullers. ... Only with great lu ck and fitness... can the hunter be in on the pull with the knife. On the whole it is better not to have dogs so fast as to be able to pull deer unless you are going in for that line exclusively
