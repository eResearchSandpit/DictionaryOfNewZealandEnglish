Quote: Skin colour and the mixture of blood which is responsible for it [sc. high visibility in a white world] are often commented on by one Maori to another. The terms `mongrel', `black mongrel', `dago', or `black nigger', for instance, are often used by Maoris either in referring to themselves or to other Maoris in the neighbourhood. Thus one informant, in introducing herself, remarked: `I'm only a mongrel' - meaning only a mixed-blood Maori.
