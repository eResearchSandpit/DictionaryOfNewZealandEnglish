Quote: The Australian diggers soon found out, that hitherto only the superficial deposits had been worked, and that they had not yet come to the `bottom', where ... the richest treasure was to be expected. They began `deep sinkings', and after having dug to a depth of about 130 feet ... struck a second gold-bed.
