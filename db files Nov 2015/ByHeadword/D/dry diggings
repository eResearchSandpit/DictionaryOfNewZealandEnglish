Quote: The conglomerates accumulated on the slopes of the mountains are the proper field for the "dry diggings", while from the gravel and sand streams the gold is obtained by "wet diggings".

Quote: By the gradual wearing away of these rocks ... large masses of debris have been formed, and nature itself has executed an operation of gold-washing, by collecting the heavier particles and depositing them in the gullies of streams, or in the conglomerates covering the slopes of the hills.  There are, therefore, two principal descriptions of diggings; either `river diggings', in the beds of streams, or `dry diggings', in the conglomerate and gravel accumulated on the slopes of the mountains.
