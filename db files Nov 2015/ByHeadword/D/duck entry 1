Quote:  `There are eleven species of Native Ducks belonging to nine genera, all found elsewhere, except two--the little Flightless Duck  of the Auckland Islands (genus <i>Nesonetta</i>) and the Blue  Mountain Duck (<i>Hymenolaemus</i>). Among the most interesting of the non-endemic forms, are the Paradise Duck or Sheldrake  (<i>Casarca variegata</i>), the Brown Duck (<i>Anas chlorotis</i>),  the Shoveller or Spoonbill duck (<i>Rhynchaspis variegata</i>), and the Scaup or Black Teal (<i>Fuligula Novae-Zealandiae</i>).']
