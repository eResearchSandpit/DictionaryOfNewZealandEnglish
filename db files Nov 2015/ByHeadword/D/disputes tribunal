Quote: Some obsolete  terms  (e.g.  entail, foreclosure, probation)  are not noted as historical only.    Even the Dictionary of New Zealand English (DNZE) (1997) is patchy in its coverage of legal terms, having for example no entry for disputes tribunal, family protection, incorporated society, Maori option, protection order, resource consent.
