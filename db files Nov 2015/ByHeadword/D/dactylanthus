Quote: It was a small twig, of reddish wood, with three delicately shaped wooden flowers clustered towards the end. They were hard, beautifully fashioned, securely fastened to the stem.  `No, they won't come off,' said Les. `That's dactylanthus;  Dactylanthus Taylori. It's a parasite that gets into the roots of various native trees, usually five finger or lancewood.'
