Quote: ... Merinos, run on hard, dry country, are much lighter to handle than `dual purpose', or mutton breeds run on high-producing lands...  The Corriedale is a very popular dual- [132] purpose breed, with a good heavy fleece of quality wool, and an excellent carcass, which makes the Corriedale ewe ideal for producing fat lambs.
