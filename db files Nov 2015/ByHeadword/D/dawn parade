Quote: That year I went into the Anzac service myself. Mr Meechin had no car. My father and I took him in for the dawn parade in the utility. When I was really toung I thought Dawn Parade was agirl, but as I grew up I came to realise the solemn implications of the Anzac Day ceremonial.

Quote: The introduction of "dawn parades" similar to those held in Australia was advanced at a meeting of the Returned Soldiers' Association [in Dunedin] by Mr. C. L. Calvert... They were peculiarly Australian in origin, their particular association with that country being derived from the fact that the Australians went over the top at Anzac at dawn.
