Quote: 'Come up for the docking,' said Alf, who managed Otairi Station, near Hunterville. Docking is Northspeak for marking, but wherever it is you have to muster the sheep, yard them and do unspeakable things like dagging, drenching, earmarking, tailcutting and a considerable amount of castration.
