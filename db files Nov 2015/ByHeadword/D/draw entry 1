Quote:  [The fibres of wood in a tree just about to fall] do not part all in one plane and `stringers' or `drawers' are drawn out of the barrel, sometimes several feet long. Sometimes men on contract, trying to save timber, place their saw-cut too low and some of the wood-fibres break off up in the barrel. These are `stringers' while they are breaking, and `slivers' or `drawers' when they are left upright in the sloven.

Quote: A `draw' was a serious defect, but was not due to any fault in the living tree. When a tree fell before it was quite severed, it sometimes, in the act of falling, wrenched or `drew' out a portion of the butt, leaving great jagged, fang-like splinters adhering to the stump. The damage was, of course, always to the heart wood ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 156 [Edward Thompson] ... very often, before the saw got within a foot or so of the front scarf, the tree would start to fall gradually, and the uncut timber between the saw and the front scarf would have to break, and seldom cleanly; the heart, being more brittle than the sap, would break here and there, several feet above where thesawcut would have been standing straight. As the tree fell, these pieces, still attached to the stump, would draw out of the tree, and being almost heart-wood constituted the chief defect we call `draws'.
