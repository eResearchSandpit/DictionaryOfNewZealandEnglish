Quote:  The most outstanding feature of doggy wool is a wider and more shallow crimp than is normal for wool of equivalent fineness. A secondary feature of some doggy wools is a very lustrous appearance. So far doggy wool has attracted notice only in Merino wool and wool from breeds with Merino in their ancestry.
