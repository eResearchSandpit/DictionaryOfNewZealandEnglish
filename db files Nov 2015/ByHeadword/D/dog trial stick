Quote: After the dog, the only other assistance or weapon a triallist can have is what a British shepherd would call a crook, but to us is simply a dog trial stick. It is much shorter than an overseas triallist's crook - it can't be longer than a metre - and it can be used only to wave at sheep .. sheep can run into a trial stick.
