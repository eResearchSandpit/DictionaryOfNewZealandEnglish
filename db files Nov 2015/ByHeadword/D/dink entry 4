Quote: I have seen a number of university men of the Rifle Brigade, generally known to us as the Dinks - a name they have cheerfully accepted and try to live up to.  [fn] The newspapers urging enlistment in 1915 declared that the later men, joining the forces with motives of reasoned patriotism, would be more praiseworthy than the `impetuous spirits' of the Main Body. Hence thesardonic nickname of `the Dinks' - dinkum soldiers - attached to the new brigade.

Quote: The New Zealand Rifle Brigade, perhaps better known as the `Dinks', will hold a reunion in Wellington ... (How did they get their name? The black buttons, badges, and blazes, and theunusual drill of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade led to their being dubbed `the dinkum soldiers.' Shortened to `The Dinks' it was accepted as an honourable title.)
