Quote: In the 'seventies and 'eighties many fraudulent debtors, embezzlers and rich thieves escaped from New Zealand before arrest, by doing what came to be known as the `Pacific Slope'. Someone discovered that the Sandwich Islands, which were then ruled by a native queen, had no extradition treaty with New Zealand and consequently rogues who were much `wanted' by the police in this country on reaching Honolulu could laugh at writs and law proceedings.

Quote: The Wanganui Chronicle says: The latest idea in "sweeps" is what is known as the "Pacific Slope" stakes. All the names of the prominent business men are entered, and the drawer of the next person who leaves his Wanganui creditors and crosses the Pacific, scoops the pool. We hear that the stakes are large, so it may be worth the while of the holder of them to do the "slope" himself.
