Quote: The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referredto tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'.
