Quote: Much of the credit for producing the Drysdale breed must go to its original ancestor the Neilson ram lamb named "Pa Neilson", which... had such a hairy coat that Dry had to invent another category which he named the "N"-grade in honour of its owner.

Quote: The man who developed the Drysdale sheep breed, Dr Francis William Dry has died in Palmerston North. He was [87 years old.] Dr Dye was born in Driffield, Yorkshire, and educated at Bridlington School and Leeds University from which he graduated in 1925 as a Doctor of Science. He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers. He retired from Massey University in 1956 as Professor of Animal Genetics but continued his interest in the Drysdale till his death.
