Quote: Tagged the skateboard on steroids, the dirtsurfer - built for careering down mountain sides or ripping up a mellow grassy slope - has the same fluid turning motion that has hooked every surfer, snowboarder and kiteboarder... Dirt surfers have an "aircraft aluminium" frame, a flexible deck for suspension, two knobby BMZX tyres and calf-operated brakes.
