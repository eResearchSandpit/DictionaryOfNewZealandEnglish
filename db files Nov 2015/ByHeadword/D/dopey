Quote: dopey or dozey: a ewe which loses interest in life is said to go dopey. Usually she has been suffering the lack of a steadily rising nutritional plane during her pregnancy and often is carrying twins. Her disease is thus sometimes termed twin-lamb disease. More correctly it is pregnancy toxaemia. [dozey]
