One of the digers [sic] helped us and he came to the conclusion we should have to paddock it which is to work it like a quarry, large at the top instead of driveing levells [sic]. This man and his mates afterwards worked it in this way ... Theygot colour.

Quote: Immediately north of the [Waikaka] township a rich layer in the fault-involved older quartz drifts, ... was worked from the surface ... This layer is locally known as the `back lead'. On or near it a shaft was sunk ... but was not utilised for driving-out. ... Somewhere about 1880 ... others drove an inclined drift from point to the southward of the back lead for a distance of 254 feet ... Then they drove horizontally for a short distance and intersected an auriferous ... layer of quartz wash, about 10 feet wide, known as the `front lead'.

Quote: DRIVE: a horizontal excavation. As a verb (`driving') to make a horizontal excavation. `Drive' and `tunnel' were used interchangeably, but properly one tunnelled into a lead or reef and then commenced to `drive' along it.
