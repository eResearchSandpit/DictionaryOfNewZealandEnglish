Quote: "Chris" Christoffells, the engineer at Rotorua, painted a typically English pub sign, <i>The Dung Duster's Arms</i>", and this hung in a prominent place behind the bar. <i>Ibid</i> 315 In the days when topdressing meant tiger moths many farmers were critical of how the fertiliser spread on the ground. They saw the superphosphate dust fall from the aircraft but it quickly settled on the grass and vanished from sight. A few pilots were astute enough to see the sprinkling of superphosphate on the cow dung in the paddocks. The farmers were called over to admire the dusting. So naturally topdressing pilots became "dung busters."
