Quote: Young Bradshaw's the boy who is flying this plane,/ She is as full as a tick and it's pouring with rain./ Things are not going good - his donk's on the blink* -/ Then he puts up a blue and she dives in the drink./ [fn] *his donk's on the blink: his engine is giving trouble (airman's slang) [Charles had served in the RNZAF in WW2]
