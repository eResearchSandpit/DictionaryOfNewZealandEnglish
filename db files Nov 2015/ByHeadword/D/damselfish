Quote: <i>BLACK ANGELFISH</i> (Black damselfish) <i>Parma  alboscapularis </i>... Until recently this fish was thought to be identical to the Australian white-ear <i>Parma microlepis</i> ... As their name suggests the adults of both sexes are a uniform black in colour with a prominent white ear spot that can be turned [239] off and on like a signal light ...
