Quote: The Oamaru Times (now the Oamaru Mail) of 9 July 1869 carried a report of thirs annual Wanaka dog trial on 22-23 June of that year. This proves two things - that the Wanaka club held their first event in 1867 (six years before the Welsh), and that the time it takes clubs to get their results in the paper hasn't speeded up in 130 years!
