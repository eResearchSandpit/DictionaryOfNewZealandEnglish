Quote: I surmise from their size and general colour on the wing that they are probably what somesimply call large dragonflies, or others name more colourfully Devil's Darning Needles, or Horse Stingers (or, in Scotland, Flying Adders). [92] ... My book on native insects says the `darning needle' nickname derives from a tradition that the dragonflies sew up the ears of delinquents. And that a Maori legend records a chief who dispatched an army of them (he would have calledthem kapokapowai) to destroy an enemy and all his habitations.
