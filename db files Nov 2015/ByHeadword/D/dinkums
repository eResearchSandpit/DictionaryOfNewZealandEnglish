Notes: When my eye first  fleetingly caught this par, I thought it referred to NZers. This actually states that it refers to Australians but the similarity of names is such that I wonder if this is a sub-editor's misinterpretation of the review or his precis of another paragraph.

Quote: A reviewer of Captain Bean's book "Letters from France," quotes the nicknames of the successive drafts of Australian forces to fight for the cause of the Old Country. "The Tourists" came first, - people out to see what the adventure was like. The next shipment were the "Dinkums", the true men; followed by the "Super-Dinkums". Then arrived the "War Babies" and the "Chocolate Soldiers", and after them the "Hard Thinkers" who thought very hard before they came, and last of all the "Neutrals".
