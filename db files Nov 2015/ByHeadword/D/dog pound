Quote: Then there's `the dog pound'. That's solitary confinement. It's the only part of the institute that looks like a real prison. A concrete cell, bars on the window. Cold in the winter, hot in the summer. Inside you peel potatoes all day or scrub the concrete floors. You go to the pound for disobeying orders or fighting.
