Quote: Are you reading my mind Peter? That's exactly what this Jewish New Zealander was about to say. And there are more gay men in NZ than Jews, I'm sure. .. The whole idea of a "mainstream New Zealander" is bogus anyway .. except as dogwhistle code for "real New Zealander". Which is why Jordan's annoyed. And so am I.

Quote: The net also plays into the Tories' hands by facilitating the "dog-whistle" campaigning at which Michael Howard has become increasingly adept. Just as a dog-whistle is inaudible to humans but is heard by every canine within miles, Howard has been beaming messages at targeted groups-anti-abortion campaigners, and people hostile to immigrants, gypsies and asylum-seekers-which, if broadcast in the normal way, might repel the majority of voters.
