Quote: Well, we started talking about this and that and ended up on Nuts's sister Violet, the one who was having this baby. `When's she goin' to drop it?' Jim Dickson asked Nuts. `Drop what?' `The kid.' Snigger, snigger. `She's not goin' to drop it,' said Nuts angrily. `It's goin' to be born.' `Same thing,' answered this know-all. `What do you know about babies, mate?' asked Nuts.
