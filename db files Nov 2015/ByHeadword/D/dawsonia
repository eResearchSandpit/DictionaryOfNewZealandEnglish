Quote: Of all the ground dwellers in the forest none equals in stature the  DAWSONIA or KING MOSS (<i>Dawsonia superba</i>), which though native also to Australia and Tasmania, nevertheless reaches its largest dimensions in the forests north of Westland, more particularly the [66] kauri forests. ... The normal height ranges from eight inches to a foot, but many specimens attain twice that height ... Truly it deserves the alternative name of GIANT MOSS.
