Quote: The dusky dolphin (<i>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</i>) is perhaps as plentiful round the coast of New Zealand as the common porpoise. It can be distinguished from it by the falcate dorsal fin and the more pointed snout. It is black above and white below, with an oblique white band on the flanks.
