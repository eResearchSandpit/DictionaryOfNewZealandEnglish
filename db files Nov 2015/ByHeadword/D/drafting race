Quote: At Macfarlane's the men saddled fresh horses and rode in some cattle which we had a great bother to yard, as everything was new ... The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding.

Quote: DRAFTING: The main feature of sheepyards is the drafting race. This race, perhaps eight feet in length, is only wide enough for sheep to pass through in single file; at the end of the race are two swinging gates which can be manipulated to turn the sheep into different yards, and so separate them into different `lines' or mobs.
